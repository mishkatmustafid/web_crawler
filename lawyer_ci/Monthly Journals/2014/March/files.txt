M. Rezaul Karim along with Mr. Aminul Islam, learned Advocates.<br/><br/>Having placed the application, Mr. S. M. Rezaul Karim along with Mr. Aminul Islam, learned Advocate submits that though the case is still under investigation and pending before the Court of the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka, the police administration being illegally influenced by the business rivals of the accused-petitioners are desperate enough to harass them by placing them into custody inasmuch as the officials of the Anti-Corruption Commission are promptly active and they have ample power to influence the lower judiciary and hence, the accused-petitioners have reasonable apprehension that if they surrender before the concerned Court, they would not be dealt with in accordance with law and accordingly, this Court may be pleased to grant them anticipatory bail.<br/><br/>The application is opposed by Mr. A.S.M. Nazmul Haque, learned Deputy Attorney General along with Mr. Abdul Khaleque, learned Assistant Attorney General for the State.<br/><br/>We have perused the application and heard the learned Advocate for the accused-petitioners and the learned Deputy Attorney General along with the learned Assistant Attorney General.<br/><br/>The substance of the F.I.R. is that the accused-petitioners and 14 others in connivance with each other dishonesty, falsely, fraudulently and upon committing criminal breach of trust by misusing power and obtaining gain showed false and fabricated import and export between Paragon Printing and Packaging Limited, an account-holder in the Hotel Sheraton Branch, Sonali Bank Limited, and M/S Paragon Knit Composite Limited, both are under the same ownership, withdrew and misappropriated Taka-5,20,00,000.00 accumulated as the Inland Bill Purchase (IBP) value by concealing the source thereof upon suspicious transaction by transferring, converting and layering, and thus, the accused-persons committed offences under Section 406/409/420/109 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Section 4 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012.<br/><br/>Section 3 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the provisions of this Ain, subject to the provisions of section 9 thereof, shall be effective.<br/><br/>Subsection (1) of section 9 of the Ain provides that the offences under this Ain having been deemed to have been included in the schedule of the A.C.C Act, 2004 shall be investigated into by the Commission, an officer of the Commission authorized by it or an officer of any other investigating agency authorized by the Commission. Subsection (2) of section 9 provides that the offences under this Ain shall be triable by the Special Judge appointed under section 3 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. Subsection (3) of section 9 provides that the Commission or an officer of any other investigating agency authorized by the Commission may apply the A.C.C. Act, 2004 and this Ain side by side to the inquiry into and identification of the property of the accused-person.<br/><br/>The offences under the A.C.C. Act, 2004, and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947), the offences punishable under sections 161-169, 217, 218, 408, 409 and 477A of the Penal, abetments as specified in section 109 of the Penal Code in respect of the said offences and the other means of abetments, conspiracy specified in the Penal Code including the conspiracy under section 120B thereof, and the attempts to commit offences specified in section 511 of the Penal Code are included in the schedule of the A.C.C. Act, 2004, while, the offences under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, as per section 9(1) of the Ain, are deemed to have been included in the said schedule.<br/><br/>Section 28(1) read with section 2(Tha) of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 provides that the offences under the Act and the offences  specified in the schedule of the Act shall be triable by the Special Judge appointed under section 3 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. Section 28(2) of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 specifically provides that the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 shall be applicable to the trial of the offences under the Act and the offences included in the schedule of the Act and disposal of appeals under this Act.<br/><br/>Therefore, the provisions of both the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 and A.C.C. Act, 2004 are applicable to the investigation into and trial of the offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, A.C.C. Act, 2004, the other offences included in the schedule of the A.C.C. Act, 2004, and the offences included in the schedule of the A.C.C. Act, 2004, and the offences under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, which are deemed to have been included in the schedule of the A.C.C. Act, 2004.<br/><br/>However, section 28(3) of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 provides that if any provision of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 is inconsistent with any provision of A.C.C. Act, 2004, the provision of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 shall be effective.<br/><br/>Therefore, in case of any inconsistency the provisions of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 shall prevail over the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 in the investigation into and trial of the offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, ACC Act, 2004, the other offences specified in the schedule of the ACC Act, 2004, and the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012.<br/><br/>Section 11 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012 provides that the offences under this Ain shall be cognizable, non-compoundable and non- bailable.<br/><br/>Similarly, section 28(Ka) of the ACC Act, 2004 provides that offences under this Act shall be cognizable and non-bailable.<br/><br/>But section 12(1) of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012 provides that no Court shall take cognizance of the offences under this Ain without the sanction of the Commission; while, section 12(2) provides that the Investigating Officer shall obtain the sanction of the Commission after completing the investigation and before submitting the Investigation Report to the Court, and shall also submit a copy of the sanction with the Investigation Report to the Court.<br/><br/>Similarly, Section 32(1) of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in force, no Court shall take cognizance of any offence under this Act without the sanction of the Commission; while section 32(2) of the Act provides that after completion of the investigation and before submission of the Investigation Report to the Court, the Investigating  Officer shall obtain the sanction of the Commission and a letter of the sanction shall have to be submitted to the Court along with the Investigation Report.<br/><br/>Therefore, from a thorough reading of sections 9(2), 11, 12(1) and 12(2) of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012 and sections 28(1) read with section 2(Tha), 28(Ka), 32(1) and 32(2) of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 it appears that the Special Judge appointed under section 3 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 can take cognizance of any offence under the Money laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, A.C.C. Act, 2004 and any offence specified in the schedule of the Act only after submission of Investigation Report along with the sanction of the Commission.<br/><br/>Since the time and stage of taking cognizance of the offences specified above are fixed by the respective special laws, the Special Judge cannot legally take cognizance of the offences before that time and stage i.e. before submission of the Investigation Report along with the sanction of the Commission.<br/><br/>Therefore, the offences under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, A.C.C. Act, 2004 and the offences specified in the schedule of the Act become cognizable by the Special Judge only after and not before the submission of the Investigation Report along with the sanction of the Commission.<br/><br/>Thus, the provisions under section 12 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012 and those under section 32 of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 demonstrate the intentions of the legislatures to safeguard the concerned person against taking cognizance of the offence before submission of the Investigation Report i.e. during investigation into the allegations.<br/><br/>Section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 provides that the provisions of Chapter XX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 shall apply to trial of cases under this Act, as far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. Chapter XX of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the trial of cases by the Magistrates.<br/><br/>Therefore, the Special Judge is to follow the procedure similar to that, which is followed by the Magistrate in the trial of cases in so far as it is not inconsistent with any provision of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958.<br/><br/>But it is a settled principle of law that proceeding before a Court starts when the Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence either on a police report or on a complaint. In this regard, the case of <strong><em>Nasiruddin Mohmud Vs. Montazuddin Ahmed, 36 DLR (AD)</em></strong> <strong><em>14</em></strong> may be referred to.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case can be said to have been instituted in a Court only when it takes cognizance of the offence alleged therein.<br/><br/>Even, in the case of a cognizable offence, the Magistrate takes cognizance only when the police have completed the investigation and it comes to the Magistrate for the issue of process. In this regard the case of <strong><em>Kh. Ehtesham Uddin Ahmed Vs. State, 33 DLR (SC) 154</em></strong> may be relied upon, wherein it was held as under-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The order-sheet shows that on receiving charge-sheet the learned Sub-Divisional Magistrate passed an order on May 10, 1978 for issuing warrant of arrest against some of the accused and for production of some of the accused by the surety. With reference to this order of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate the learned Attorney General correctly submitted that this order sufficiently indicates that cognizance was taken by the learned Sub-Divisional Magistrate, and he was in seisin of the case.”  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>And then, it was further held-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The word ‘case’ has not been defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure but there is no doubt that when cognizable offence is lodged with the police, and the police sends a report of the same to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of offence on a police report, it becomes a case pending before a Criminal  Court.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Apart from the law enunciated in the above mentioned case, it is a long established principle of law that taking cognizance is effected by issue of process either in the form of a summons or warrant of arrest. In the other words, no process can be issued without taking cognizance of the offence alleged in the case.<br/><br/>In the most relevant case under the A.C.C. Act, 2004 that is the case of <strong><em>Anti-Corruption Commission Vs. Dr Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and others, 62 DLR (AD) 290</em></strong>, the Appellate Division held-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“From the above discussions, it will be clear that the words <strong>মামলা দায়ের </strong>means institution of a case by submission of a charge sheet by an officer of the Commission, before the concerned Court and certainly not an first information report as envisaged under section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or a complaint অভিযোগ as envisaged under rule 3 and rule 4 of the Rules.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It has already been found that after completion of the investigation and before submission of the Investigation Report to the Court, the Investigation Officer shall obtain the sanction of the Commission and submit a letter of the sanction with the Investigation Report to the Court.<br/><br/>Therefore, under the A.C.C. Act, 2004 no case is legally said to have been instituted before submission of Investigation Report along with the sanction of the Commission.<br/><br/>Unless a case is legally deemed to have been instituted against any person, no Court can either take cognizance of the offence or issue any process against such a person.<br/><br/>We have already found that the offences under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, A.C.C Act, 2004 and the offences specified in the schedule of the Act become cognizable by the Special Judge only after submission of the Investigation Report along with the sanction of the Commission.<br/><br/>For the same reason, though under subsection (3) of section 20 of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 the Investigating Officer enjoys the powers of an Officer-in-Charge of a Police Station in the matter of investigation, such powers do not include the power of arrest without warrant until the offences become cognizable by the Special Judge upon submission of the Investigation Report.<br/><br/>Therefore, the Commission cannot arrest any accused-person during the investigation into the allegations and before the cognizance of the offence is taken upon submission of the Investigation Report.<br/><br/>Section 20(1) of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 envisages that the offences under the Act and the offences specified in the schedule of the Act shall be investigated into by the Commission only. So, the police has no role to play in any case on the allegations of the offences under the A.C.C. Act, 2004 the offences specified in the schedule of the Act and under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012. However, the Special Judge may order or the Commission may call the police to arrest any accused-person in an appropriate case after the cognizance of the offence alleged therein has been taken.<br/><br/>Therefore, the police on their own accord cannot arrest any accused before or after submission of the Investigation Report in any case on the allegations of the offences under the A.C.C. Act, 2004, the offences specified in the schedule of the Act and under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012.<br/><br/>In such view of the matter, the Special Judge neither can take cognizance of the offences nor can he issue any process nor can the Commission arrest any accused-person during the investigation inasmuch as the police on their own accord also cannot arrest any accused-persons, and as such, no accused-person legally requires any bail during investigation in any case on the allegations of the offences under the A.C.C. Act, 2004, the offences specified in the schedule of the Act and under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012.<br/><br/>It is a settled principle of law that after submission of the Investigation Report there remains no scope for anticipatory bail in any case.<br/><br/>Therefore, there is no scope or necessity for any anticipatory bail in any case on the allegations of the offences under the A.C.C. Act, 2004, the offences specified in the schedule of the Act and under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012.<br/><br/>The above findings and observations made on the relevant laws may be summarised as below:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The offences under the A.C.C. Act, 2004 and the offences specified in the schedule of the Act, and those under the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012, which are deemed to have been included in the schedule of the Act, become cognizable by the Special Judge only after the submission of the Investigation Report along with the sanction of the Commission.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Under the A.C.C. Act, 2004 or on the allegations of the offences included or deemed to have been included in the schedule of the Act, no case is legally said to have been instituted before submission of Investigation Report along with the sanction of the Commission.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Unless a case is legally deemed to have been instituted against any person, no Court can either take cognizance of the offence or issue any process against such a person.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The provisions under section 12 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012 and those under section 32 of the ACC Act, 2004 demonstrate the intentions of the legislatures to safeguard the concerned person against taking cognizance of the offence before submission of the Investigation Report i.e. during investigation into the allegations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The powers of an Officer-in-Charge of a Police Station in investigation conferred to the Commission under subsection (3) of section 20 of the ACC Act, 2004 do not include the power of arrest without warrant until the offences become cognizance by the Special Judge.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Commission cannot arrest any accused-person during the investigation into the allegations and unless the offences become cognizable upon submission of the Investigation Report.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Since the allegations are to be investigated into exclusively by the Commission, the police, on their own accord, cannot arrest any accused-person before or after submission of the Investigation Report in any such case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above, no accused-person legally requires any bail during investigation in any such case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above finding No. (8), there is no legal scope or necessity for any anticipatory bail in any case on the allegations of the offences under the ACC Act, 2004 and the offences included or deemed to have been included in the schedule of the Act.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Hence, there being no legal scope or necessity for any bail, let alone anticipatory bail, during investigation in such a case on the allegations of the offences under the A.C.C. Act, 2004 and the offences included or deemed to have been included in the schedule of the Act, the application preferred for that purpose is liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>The offences under section 406, 409, 420 109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Section 4 of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2012 alleged in the present case are either included or deemed to have been included in the schedule of the A.C.C. Act, 2004 and the case is still under investigation.<br/><br/>Therefore, the above findings and observations made on the relevant laws are squarely applicable to the case in hand.<br/><br/>Accordingly, there being no legal scope or necessity for any anticipatory bail in the present case the application preferred for that purpose is rejected.<br/><br/>Send a copy of this order to the Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission forthwith.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

A. Case No. 54/77-78 of Dhaka Collectorate, some lands were acquired for Mohammadpur Housing Pisciculture and Farming Co-operative Society Ltd. in Mouza-Ramchandrapur under Mohammadpur Police Station, District-Dhaka, under the provisions of (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act,1948. The Collector assessed the compensation for ‘chala’ and ‘bhiti’ lands at the rate of Tk.4,65,700/- per acre. Being dissatisfied with the said rate of compensation, the respondents of the respective appeals filed the aforesaid arbitration cases before the learned Subordinate Judge, Arbitration Court, Dhaka claiming compensation at the rate of Tk.50,00,000/- per acre for ‘bhiti’ and ‘chala’ lands and Tk.30,00,000/- for ‘bhiti’ lands. The learned Subordinate Judge allowed the compensation at the rate of Tk.18,75,000/- per acre for ‘bhiti’ land, Tk.15,62,000/- for ‘chala’ lands and Tk.12,50,000/- for nal lands.<br/><br/>Against the judgments passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, the appellants preferred First Miscellaneous Appeal Nos.706, 744, 707 and 742 of 1991 before the High Court Division. The learned Judges of the High Court Division after hearing the parties by their judgments and orders dated 05.12.1994 and 04.09.1994 dismissed the appeals upholding the rate of compensation assessed by the learned Subordinate Judge.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgments and orders dated 05.12.1994 and 04.09.1994  passed by the High Court Division,  the Government as the leave-petitioner filed Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos.88 of 1995 and 58-60 of 1995 before this Division and obtained leave on 27.07.2000 resulting in Civil Appeal Nos.174-177 of 2000.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the appellant in all the appeals, submits that the then learned Subordinate Judge arbitrarily assessed the compensation at the rate of Tk.18,75,000/- per acre for ‘bhiti’ lands, Tk.15,62,000/- for ‘chala’ lands and Tk.12,50,000/- for nal lands and that the High Court Division without considering the rationale of assessment of compensation by the learned Subordinate Judge affirmed the awards passed by the learned Subordinate Judge.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Nawab Ali, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.1 (i)-(vi) in Civil Appeal No.174 of 2000, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Rafique-ul-Haque, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the leave petitioners in all the Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal, submits that the High Court Division was wrong in deciding not to hear the appeals filed by the petitioners.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Attorney General, the learned Advocate-on-Record and learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos.310-312 of 1999, the impugned judgments and the papers incorporated in the paper book.<br/><br/>At the very outset, it is necessary to go through the submissions of the learned Attorney General, on which, leave was granted by this Division as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“The average value of the properties of similar description and advantage in the vicinity of the respondent’s land during the 24 months preceding the date of the service of notice under sub-section (1a) of section 5 of the said Act, the assessment of compensation by the learned Arbitrator was made in contravention of the principles laid down in the proviso (i) to section 7(e) of the (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act,1948 and on the basis of no evidence and hence, the High Court Division erred in law in upholding the awards made by the learned Arbitrator.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, in L.A. Case No.54/77-78 of Dhaka Collectorate was initiated to acquire some lands for Mohammadpur Housing Pisci culture and Farming Co-operative Society Ltd. in Mouza-Ramchandrapur under Mohammadpur Police Station, District-Dhaka, under the provisions of (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act, 1948. The Collector assessed the compensation of ‘chala’ and ‘bhiti’ lands at the rate of Tk. 4,65,7000/- per acre. Being dissatisfied with the rate of compensation, the respondents of the respective appeals filed the arbitration cases before the learned Subordinate Judge, Arbitration Court, Dhaka claiming compensation at the rate of  Tk.50,00,000/- per acre for ‘bhiti’ and ‘chala’ lands and Tk. 30,00,000/- for ‘nal’ lands. The learned Subordinate Judge allowed the compensation at the rate of Tk.18,75,000/- per acre for ‘bhiti’ lands, Tk.15,62,000/- for ‘chala’ lands and Tk. 12,50,000/- for nal lands.<br/><br/>From the record, it appears that Mouza-Ramchandrapur is adjacent to Mouza-Kafrul from which lands were acquired the in L.A. case and the rate of compensation of the nal lands situated within Kafrul mouza was assessed at the rate of Tk.12,50,000/- per acre and in about 100 first miscellaneous appeals, the High Court Division affirmed this rate of compensation. We are of the view that the learned Subordinate Judge has not committed any error either in law or in fact in assessing the compensation of the nal lands acquired. The assessment of compensation made by the learned Subordinate Judge having been made on proper appreciation of facts and laws should not be interfered with. The High Court Division also found that the compensation was assessed in accordance with law.<br/><br/>Admittedly, with the passage of time, the price of the land has increased manifold and because of filing of unnecessary appeals by the Government, the respondents of the concerned appeals were deprived of getting the compens-ation money earlier and the compensation assessed more than three decades back is shockingly low in comparison with the present market value. <br/><br/>In the light of the findings made before, we do not find any substance whatsoever in all the appeals. Accordingly, these appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos.310-312 of 1999 against the order of the High Court Division not to hear the writ petitions on the ground of pendency of Civil Appeals before the Appellate Division are also dismissed. The leave petitioners of the civil petitions for leave to appeal may take step before the High Court Division in getting their writ petitions disposed of on merit. <br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>

Case no. 13/86-87 and the plaintiff and his father received the award money by receipt no. 0112971 dated 28.04.1988.<br/><br/>Plaintiff did not file any document nor he take any step to prove such acquire. Moreover in cross examination as P.W-1 he stated that , “আমার পিতা থেকে ৭ শতক এবং আমার থেকে ৪ শতক ভূমি (বিরোধীয়) খাগড়াছড়ি রোডের জন্য একোয়ার করা হয় সে মর্মে কোন কাগজ আমি দাখিল করিনি এবং তলব দেইনি সংশ্লিষ্ট দপ্তর থেকে|”. On the other hand the defendant no. 2 as D.W. stated in his deposition that, “wদঘীনালা সড়কের জন্যে নালিশী দাগের দক্ষিন পূর্বাংশের ১২.৭৫ শতক ভূমি হুকুম দখল করা হয়। নালিশী দাগে আমার পিতা তোফাজ্জলের অংশ থেকে এবং বাদীর অংশ থেকে সম্পত্তি হুকুম দখল করা হয়। এল, এ, কেইচ নং ১৩/৭৫-৭৬ মামলার নথী সহকারী জজ আদালতের মিচ ১৫/৯৬ মামলার নথীর সাথে সন্নিবেশিত আছে। সেখানে আমি সংবাদের দরখাস্তের কপি দাখিল করেছি (প্রদ-ক)” and stated that, “একোয়ারক্রত জমির ক্ষতিপূরণের টাকা বাদী ও আমার পিতা গ্রহণ করে ” and also stated that, “নালিশী দাগের হুকুম দখল কৃত জমির ক্ষতিপূরনের টাকা পেয়ে ১টি রসিদের ফটোকপি আমি কোর্টে দাখিল করেছি।” more over the defendant no. 2 filed an application in the appellate court for call for the said L.A. Case record on 24.08.2003 which was allowed on the same date vide order no. 28 and subsequently the said record was received by the court vide order no. 31 dated 24.01.2004.<br/><br/>The lower appellate Court being a final court of fact did not at all consider and discuss about the said L.A. case or money receipt  No. 0112971 dated 28.04.1988 rather he disallowed the appeal with a finding that, “বাদী যে ০৬ শতক সম্পত্তির প্রাথমিক ডিক্রী পাইয়াছে তাহা বাদীর খরিদা সম্পত্তি হয়। কতটুকু সম্পত্তি একোয়ার হইয়াছে বা কতটুকু সম্পত্তির ক্ষতিপূরন পাইয়াছে তাহা অত্র বিভাগ মামলায় বিবেচ্য বিষয় নহে|” though he affirmed the claim of the plaintiff that .03 acres of land was acquired from the plaintiff and .07 acres of land was acquired from the father of the plaintiff without any basis.<br/><br/>Both the courts below failed to consider that the plaintiff got .0581 acres of land on the basis of his purchase deed no. 155 dated 21.01.56 and his father got .07 acres of land by purchase out of which .1275 acres of land was acquired and the plaintiff and his father jointly received the award money on 28.06.1988 through receipt no. 0112971 by which the plaintiff became title less and as such the suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>The defendant no. 2 claimed that he purchased .03 acres of land from the suit plot including .07 acres of land from the non suited plot from Abdur Rashid by registered kabala dated 22.02.1952 but he got possession of .10 acres of land from the suit plot according to the said deed.<br/><br/>The courts below calculated the share of Abdur Rashid that he got .2319 acres of land out of which he sold .07 acres of land to the plaintiff and his father by registered deed no. 64 dated 10.01.51, .07 acres of land to Obaidur Rahman by registered deed dated 10.10.51 and .05 acres of land to Obaidur Rahman by registered deed dated 22.02.52 in total .19 acres of land and he had saleable interest in respect of .0419 acres of land out of which he sold only .03 acres of land from the suit plot to the defendant no. 2 by registered deed dated 22.02.52 without considering and discussing about the schedule of the said registered deed no. 526 dated 22.02.52 where it was written that,  and without considering and discussing about the schedule of the registered deed no. 525 dated 22.02.52 by which he transferred .03 acres of plot no. 4431 and .02 acres of plot no. 4372 but it was written that, which proved that Abdur Rashid sold .10 acres of land to the defendant no. 2 earlier to Obaidur Rahman. Moreover the courts below though considered the written of plot number of the deed of the defendant no. 2 but at the same time did not consider the written of the plot number of the deed of Obaidur Rahman.<br/><br/>The defendant no. 2 claimed .02 acres of land on the basis of registered Osiyatnama dated 15.12.1985 which was produced in the Appellate Court as additional evidence and marked as exhibit no. ‘Ga-1’ and the Appellate Court discussed only condition no. 4 of the said Osiyatnama but did not discuss the condition no. 14 of the said Osiyatnama in which .02 acres of land of suit plot has been given to defendant no. 2 and not challenged by the plaintiff.<br/>Both the courts below wrongly decreed the suit in misreading and non consideration of the evidence on record and thus committed error of Law occasioning failure of justice and as such the rule is liable to be made absolute with a finding that the defendant no. 2 became owner and possessor of .10 acres of land by way of purchase and .02 acres by way of Osiyatnama out of which he sold .03 acres to the defendant no. 1 (as the defendant no. 1 did not challenge the said decree) and the defendant no. 2 is entitled to get saham in respect of the rest .09 acres of land and the plaintiff has no title, possession and interest in the suit land.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the opposite party submits that the defendant no.2 claimed title in the property by way of purchase from Abdur Rashid. He transferred the land vide several deeds on 10.1.1995 to Abdur Rashid o.7 decimal of land  to the father of the plaintiff and defendant nos. 2-7 decimals  to Obaidur Rahman on 22.2.1952 to Abdur Rashid transferred .05 acres of land to Obaidur Rahman  before such transfer 19 decimals were transferred before the  transfer to the defendant no.2 and defendant no.2 transferred to the defendant no. 1 more or less  4 decimals of land so the entire share of Abdur Rashid has been  exhausted  so defendant no. 2 has no remaining land out of purchase from Abdur Rashid   since the entire  share has been exhausted whether the suit land was acquired or not acquired how much land was  acquired by road and highway is also immaterial. Osaiyatnama  coming into force after the death of the donee  without the consent of the other co-sharers so defendant no. 2 can not claim any share on the strength of osaiyatnam made by the father.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate also submits that   none  of the Courts below did not discuss how much quantum of land was acquired by roads and high way    was also not considered by the courts below at the time of passing impugned judgment and decree. The learned Advocate lastly submits that the concurrent findings of facts by both the courts below does not deserve any interference under the revisional jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court and consequently the rule is liable to be discharged.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocates of both sides perused the impugned judgment and decree for the courts below considered the submissions as advanced by the learned Advocates of both sides in support of their case. On perusal of the impugned judgment and decree of the courts below we find at the trial the trial court framed as many as 5 issues for determination of the suit. The issues are:</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit maintainable?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Is the suit bad for defect of parties?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Does the suit suffer from bad for hotch potch?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Has the plaintiff any right title and possession over the suit property?</li><li style="text-align:justify">Is the plaintiff entitled to get the preliminary decree of partition as prayed for?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">At the trial the plaintiff examined one witness, the defendant no.1 examined two witnesses. The defendant nos. 2-6, 7 and 8 examined 1 witness from each side.<br/><br/>It is admitted that Aminur Rahman auctioned purchased the suit land. It is also admitted that Aminur Rahman died leaving behind Abdur Rashid as the son, Jamila Khatun as the wife and Hejera Khatun and Sabeda Khatun as two daughters to inherit him.<br/><br/>Plaintiff Md. Safi as P.W. 1 in his evidence deposes that he has purchased .09 decimals of land out of the suit plot from the wife and two daughters of Aminur Rahman by a registered deed dated 21.1.56 and the worth of the sale deed was given to the donor by his father.   The plaintiff has filed the said original deed (exhibit -1). On going through the exhibit-1 it is seen that the plaintiff has purchased. .09 decimals of land out of the suit plot from the wife and two daughters of Aminur Rahman by the said deed and the worth of the same was paid to the donor from plaintiff’s father. It is the positive case of plaintiff that out of his .09 decimals of land .03 decimals has been acquired by the Roads and Highway authority for constructing the Dighi Nala Road and now barring such .03 cents he has of plaintiff that out of his .09 decimals of land .03 decimals has been acquired by the Roads and Highway authority for constructing the Dighi Nala Road and now barring such .03 cents he has been possessing the rest .06 decimals. In this context, the plaintiff Md. Safi as P.W.1 in his evidence deposes that his father also purchased .07 decimals of land out of the suit plot which has also been acquired by the Roads and Highway authority for Dighi Nala Road along with his .03 decimals and as such they did not inherit any property from the suit plot after the demise of their father. The said P.W. 1 in his evidence further discloses that his brother the defendant no.2 has also purchased .03 decimals of land out of the suit plots land by a registered deed which consideration was also paid by their father to the donor. It is in the evidence of P.W.1 Md. Safi that the defendant no.1 has recently disclosed that he has purchased the suit land from the defendant no.2 and that defendant nos. 1-2 have claimed their title over the suit land. The said P.W.1 in his cross-examination testifies that .07 cents of land from his father and .03 cents of land from him was acquired by the Roads and High ways department for Dighi Nala Road but he has not filed any paper with regard to such acquisition and even he has not hold any local investiga-tion to ascertain the quantum of acquired land out of the suit plots land. Moreover, on perusal of the pleadings as well as evidence of plaintiff and defendants it does not appear to us what quantum of land was acquired by the authority for Dighi Nala Road from the suit plot. This being the position, according to the title of the parties the suit property may be partitioned off among themselves. In such view of the matter, it has been adverted to earlier that the plaintiff Md. Safi has claimed that barring his acquired portion i.e. .03 decimals he has been in possession of the rest .06 decimals out of his purchased .09 decimals out of the suit plots land. Although the defendant nos. 1, 2 and 6 Ka- 6 Chha in their written statements have asserted that the plaintiffs entire share has been acquired by Roads and Highways authority for Dighi Nala Road but they have failed to produce any such documents in support of their aforesaid plea. On digging into the evidence of plaintiff (P.W.1) Md. Safi it transpires that the defence has not given any suggestion to the said PW-1 in relation to acquisition of his entire property or any quantum of land. Under the circumstances we cannot disbelieve the plaintiffs positive case that only .03 decimals of land has been acquired for Dighi Nala Road and he has been possessing the rest .06 cents of land located in the suit plot. As such, the plaintiff is entitled to get .06 decimals of land in his shaham.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the defendant no. 1 has been claimed his .5(1/8) decimals of land by way of purchase from the defendant no. 2 the full brother of plaintiff. In this context, the defendant no. 1 Md. Shah Alam as DW-1 in his evidence discloses that he has purchased .5 cents and 4.5 danta of land from the defendant no. 2 by a registered deed dated 18.2.93 bearing no. 492. The defendant no. 1 has filed the original copy of the said deed (exhibit “ka”). On perusal of the exhibit “ka” it appears that the defendant no. 2 has sold out .5(1/8) decimals of land located in suit plot. But it is the definite plea of the defendant no. 2 that he purchased .03 cents of land located in suit plot and .07 decimals of land from another plot but he got delivery of possession of the said .10 decimals of land located in plot in question and thus being the owner in possession of .10 decimals of land out of the suit plot he has sold out .5(1/8) decimals of land to the defendant no. 1 and inducted him into the possession of the same. The defendant no. 2 Md. Lokman in his evidence lands support his aforesaid positive case and he expresses that he has no objection to get the defendant no. 1’s share i.e. .5(1/8) cents of land in his separate shaham. The said defendant no. 2 in his cross examination admits that there are two plots in his purchased deed dated 26.2.52 and one is the suit plot and the another is 4377. Moreover the defendant no. 2 has filed the original copy of his purchased deed dated 26.2.52 (exhibit “kha 1”). On going though the exhibit Kha 1 it is seen that the donor of the same sold out .03 cents of land out of the suit plot land .07 cents from the plot 4377. The defendant no. 2 in his evidence claims that he got delivery of possession of the said .10 cents of land located in plot in question and thus being acquired title thereon he has sold out .05(1/8) cents of land to the defendant no. 1 and also inducted him into the possession of same accordingly.<br/><br/>It is well settled principle of law that title follows the possession. So one should have the basis of title and on the strength of such basis he may get delivery of possession. In this context admittedly the defendant no. 2 has purchased .07 decimals of land located in plot 4377 of R.S. Khatian No. 2711 but claimed he has got delivery of possession amicably located in suit plot along with its purchased .03 decimals of land. This being the position, we are of the view that without getting delivery of possession of .07 decimals of land of 4377 plots located in the said plot. The defendant no. 2 did not acquire any title over the same although he got delivery of possession of the said .07 decimals located in another plot i.e. suit plot. Because to acquire right, title and interest over a piece of land basis of title and possession are required simultaneously. In this case although the defendant no. 2 although has purchased .07 cents of land out of the plot no. 4377 but he has not got delivery of possession particularly in the said plot and as such he did not acquire any title over the said .07 decimals of land without getting its possession located in the said plot. Under the circumstances the defendant no. 2 acquired his title on .03 decimals of land out of the suit plot. Since the defendant no. 2 had no title over the .07 decimals of land of plot 4377 or in the suit plot because of non purchasing the same from the suit plot, the defendant no. 1 has also not acquired any right, title and interest over the same located in suit plot. On the contrary, as the defendant no. 2 has acquired his title on .03 decimals of land located in suit plot, the defendant no. 1 also has acquired his title over the same by way of purchase deed from the defendant no. 2. Following to such a plight the defendant no. 1 is entitled to get only .03 decimals of land out of the suit plot in his separate shaham. However, barring the said .03 decimals the defendant no. 2 had no land out of the suit plot and as such the defendant no.2 is not entitled to get any land in his shaham.<br/><br/>The defendant no. 6 curing contesting the suit died and that his legal heirs have been impleaded as defendant nos. 6Ka –6Chha. The defendant no. 6Ka the wife of the late defendant no. 6 named Sultana Begum in her evidence claims that her husband purchased .05 cents of land from Bazal Ahmed vide kabala dated 10.10.77 (Ext. Kha 2) and Bazal Ahmed purchased the same from ObaidurRahman vide kabala dated 15.3.76. The said Sultana Begum in her evidence further discloses that her husband late Monir Ahmed purchased the share of his brother Nurul Alam measuring 1(7/11) cents vide kabala dated 13.6.88 (ext. ga 2), .0(7/11) cent from Sakina vide kabala dated 6.9.88 (ext gha 2) 1(1/3) cent from Jamila, Hazera and Sabeda vide kabala dated 19.1.56 (ext. Uma 2) and 1(7/11) by way of inheritance from his father Obayedur Rahman’s .05 decimals and thus her husband got (.05+.0(7/11)+.0(7/11)+1(1/3)+1(7/11) = 10(8/33) cents of land out of the suit plot and after the demise of her husband they (deft. nos. 6ka -6chha) have inherited the same and have been in possession thereof. On perusal of the exhibits Ka 2, Ka 2(1), Kha 2, Ga 2, Gha 2 and Uma 2 it transpires that father of late Manir Ahmed purchased .10 decimals of land out of the suit plot from Abdur Rashid and sold out .05 decimals to Bazal Ahmed who also sold the same of Manir Ahmed and after the demise of Obaidur Rahman his rest .05 cents devolved on his 4 sons namely Monir Ahmed, Md. Solaiman, Meer Ahmed and Nurul Alam and 3 daughters namely Sakhina, Mahmuda and Halima and as such each sons of him got 1(7/11) cent and each daughters got .0(7/11) cent of land. It further appears that Nurul Alam and Sakhina sold out their 1(7/11) and .0(7/11) cents to Monir Ahmed and he also purchased 1(1/3) cent of land from the wife and two daughters of auction purchased Aminur Rahman and thus Monir Ahmed got 1(7/11)+1(7/11)+.0(7/11)+1(1/3)+.05 = 10(8/33) cents of land by way of inheritance as well as purchase. The defendant No. 2 Md. Lokman in his evidence admits that there is a ice-cream factory in  the suit property which has been possessed by Monir Ahmed. It is in the evidence of the defendant no. 6 Ka Sultana Begum that after the death of her husband Monir Ahmed they (deft. Nos. 6 Ka-6Chha) have been in possession of the said .10(8/33) cents of land out of the suit property by cross examining her or producing any evidence the plaintiff or other contesting defendants could not take out any discrepant statement in order to dissip.ate the credibility of the claim of defendant Nos. 5 Ka- 6 Chha’s  possession over the suit property. This being so, I cannot disbelieves their claim and possession over the same. As such, the defendant Nos. 6 ka-6  Chha are entitled to get .10(8/33) cents of land out of the suit property in their separate shaham.<br/><br/>On perusal of the exhibit Uma 2 it is seen that Md. Solaiman, Meer Ahmed and Monir Ahmed 3(three) brothers purchased .04 cents of land out the suit property from Jamila. Hazera and Sabeda by virtue of the said deed (Ext.Uma) and that the defendant No. 7 Md. Solaiman gets 1(1/3) cent of land as his 1/3rd share. The plaintiff and the contesting other defendants have not made any dispute the shares of the defendant No.7 and 8 which appearson perusal of the record and evidence in record. Thedefendant No. 8 Md. Hasem son of Meer Ahmed one of the recipients of theexhibit Uma 2 deed has prayed for .03 decimals of land by way of inheritance. Following to above discussion it has been decided that Meer Ahmed one of the sons of Obaidur Rahman got. 1(7/11) cent from his father and . 1(1/3) cent by way of purchase vide kabala dated 19.1.56 (ext.Uma) which has beendevolved on the defendant No.8.On going through the evidence on record as well as pleading it appears that there is no case or allegation that Meer Ahmed or the defendant No.8 sold out any property out of their share located in suit plot.Considering the facts and evidence on record I am of the opinion that the defendant No.8 is entitled get .03 decimals of land out of the suit property.<br/><br/>Following to the foregoing discussion, findings and decision it is seen that the defendant No. 1 has got only .03 decimals of land out of the suit property which cause has already been noticed earlier. It is noted here that the defendant Nos. 2 have not adduced any evidence in relation to his long possessionover the property measuring .10 decimals of land located in suit plot by which he has acquired title by way of adverse possession. Onthe other hand, assuming for the sake of argument if the defendant No. 2 got delivery of possessionof the .07 decimals of land of plot 4377 in the suit plot instead of the said 43377 plot, even then thedefendant No.2 cannot be acquired any title over the said .07 decimals of land of plot 4377 located in the suit plot. Becausethe said .07 decimals of land was not sold to him mentioning the suit plot but mentioningplot no. 4377 which possession cannot be delivered on the another plot.<br/><br/>In view of the foregoing discussion, findings and decision, evidence on record and in the facts and circumstances of the case we feel constrained to hold that the plaintiff has right, title and possession over.06 decimals of land out of the suit plots land.<br/><br/>Considering on perusal of the pleadings of the parties and on due consideration of both oral and documentary evidences the trial court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff in preliminary form the Additional District Judge on appeal on perusal and consideration of both oral and documentary evidences and on hearing of submissions of the parties affirmed the judgment of the trial court in dismissing the found that title and possession in favour of the plaintiff and rightly decreed the suit in preliminary form we are under the revisional jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court did not find any misreading, non-reading, non-consideration of documents in the impugned judgment and decree of the Courts below and as such we are unable to interfere with the concurrent findings of facts as arrived at by both the Courts below we find that the impugned judgment and decree of the last Court of fact does not deserve any interference under the revisional jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court as laid down in section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.The consideration. On the contrary, the submissions for the opposite parties, we find merits Civil Revision is devoid of any substance.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to coats. The impugned judgment and decree dated 26.01.2006 passed by the Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Chittagong in Other Appeal No. 50 of 2001 dismissing the appeal affirming the judgment and decree dated 30.10.2000 passed by the Senior Assistant Judge, Fatikchari, Chittagong in Partition Suit No,. 104 of 1995 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby recalled and vacated.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records with the copy of the judgment to the concern Court for information and necessary action.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

A provision which leaves an unbridled power to an authority can not in any sence be characterized as reasonable.

When all legal</strong><strong> formalities were completed for recruitment of the petitioners, it was their legitimate expectation that they would be appointed in the posts of Assistant Directors.</strong><br/><em>Legitimate expectation is not the same thing as anticipation. It is distinct and different from a desire and hope. It is based on a right. It is grounded in the rule of law as requiring regularity, predictability and certainty in the Government's dealings with the public and the doctrine of legitimate expectation operates both in procedural and substantive matters. If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or violation of principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned. It can be one of the grounds to consider but the Court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference. The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of due consid-eration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non- arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision making process. Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable or legitimate in the context is a question of fact in each case. While lifting such veil in the instant case we find that the respondents considered the petitioners 'applications after proper scrutiny and found them to be in order and accordingly, issued admit cards and allowed them to sit for the written test. The petitioners also faced viva voce examination and came out successful. The police verifications were done no adverse report was found. When all legal formalities were completed for recruitment of the petitioners, it was their legitimate expectation that they would be appointed in the posts of Assistant Directors. We are of the view that some amount of the dubiousness on the part of the Respondents have creped in when the police verification report was not supplied a long period of time in spite of the fact that neither any allegation was found against any of the petitioners nor any adverse report was furnished against any of them. To recapitulate once again, we note that prescribed forms for police verification were supplied on 06.06.2007 which were filled up and submitted, security clearance was given on 01.11.2009 by the Ministry of Home Affairs and impugned letter was passed on 30.06.2010 while keeping the matter of appointment of the petitioners pending</em><strong>. . .(22)</strong><br/><em>The Government does not have the licence of acting in an arbitrary manner and is always obliged to act fairly and reasonably even where the other party has no legal right.

We further take into account that the appointments of these petitioners were not even cancelled.

After careful scrutiny, the PSC Secretariat issued interview cards asking them to sit for written examination. The written examination was held on 08.12.2006 and about 17,000 candidates sat for the written examination. The result of the written examination was published on 10.01.2007 and only 59 candidates came out successful. The result was published in the National Dailies the next day.<br/> <br/>The petitioners and other successful candidates were called for viva voce examination. The petitioners passed the viva voce examination and were found suitable for recruitment. Thereafter, the petitioners were supplied with police verification and medical examination form vide Memo No. Bashokokosh /prosha-1/Shoshupopu-21/2003 (part-1) /472 dated 05.06.2007 and all the petitioners had submitted their forms by filling up those on the same day.<br/> <br/>All the petitioners were given the recommendation letter manifesting their selection on 06.06.2007. The recommendation of the petitioner Nos. 1, 2 and 8 were sent by the PSC through registered post but those were not delivered to them for unknown reasons.<br/> <br/>On 12.06.2007 the Deputy Secretary Administration of the PSC had sent a list of the petitioners to the Director General, Department of Health to take necessary steps for medical examination of the petitioners. Pursuant to the said letter, the office of the Director General vide letter dated 20.06.2007 had requested the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) authority to conduct medical examination of the petitioners. Subsequently, the Deputy Director of DMCH vide letter Secretary vide letter No. Damekha/posha-6/Meboard dated 25/06/2007 had informed the Secretary of the PSC Secretariat asking him to ensure presence of the petitioners on 09.07.2007 before the standing medical board of DMCH along with others reports.<br/> <br/>The PSC was under legal obligation to inform the petitioners to appear before the medical board with the reports and the treasury challan as mentioned in the letter of the DMCH dated 25.06.2007 but for malafide reasons they did not inform the petitioners but the petitioners on their own initiatives had been able to collect the correspondences long after the date fixed for their medical examination.<br/> <br/>Thereafter, the PSC on different dates had published several notifications almost in all the National Dailies to know the character and antecedents of the petitioners and the same were made inviting complaints or adverse remarks, if any, from any quarter, but no complaint was received against any of the petitioner. It is further stated that subsequently Local police, Special branch(SB), National Security Intelligence (NSI) had paid repeated visits in the present and permanent addresses of the petitioners for police verification on several occasions and found nothing adverse against the petitioners.<br/> <br/>When nothing adverse was found against the petitioners, the Ministry of Home affairs vide its letter dated 01.11.2009 under Memo No. Shomo (Nira-4)/verification-1/09/9696 had sent the security clearance along with the NOC with regard to the petitioner to the PSC. Thus, all legal formalities were completed for recruitment of the petitioners and it was their legitimate expectation that they would be appointed in the post of Assistant Director. But as ill luck would have it, no step was taken.<br/> <br/>The PSC instead of making the appointment of the petitioners vide letter No. Bashokokosh/prosha-1/Shoshupopu-21/2003 (Part-1)/04 dated 03.01.2010 had sent a letter to the Secretary, Ministry of Establishment seeking opinion over the matter of appointments of the petitioners on the grounds of expiry of two years of the period of requisition. In the letter it has been further stated that long time was spent by the Government agencies for repeated verification of the petitioners. In reply to the said letter, the Ministry of Establishment vide letter No. Shomo(SP)-43/2001-41 dated 18.01.2010 had asked for specific decision of the PSC whether further extension of the requisitions for recruitment of the petitioners and others were required or not.<br/> <br/>The PSC did not respond to the said letter and kept silent. After having waited for a long period, the father of the petitioner No.8 Md. Samsul Hoque filed an application to the Secretary, PSC on 07.02.2010 with a prayer to appoint the petitioners along with his daughter who was appointed against the quota reserved for the Freedom Fighters but no action was taken. Thereafter, the petitioner No.8 had filed an application to the Honorable Prime Minister on 15.03.2010 with the similar prayer. Apart from that, all the petitioners had filed applications on 11.05.2008 and 04.12.2008 to the PSC for the appointment but nothing was done.<br/> <br/>Instead of taking any steps for appointment of the petitioners the PSC vide letter No. 80.401.011.00.00.028.2010-607 dated 30.06.2010 had sent the impugned letter to the Secretary, Ministry of Establishment seeking sanction to fill up 6 vacant posts of Assistant Director from the qualified candidates of the 28<sup>th</sup> BCS examination .The said letter is ex-facie illegal, malafide and without any lawful authority which has been sent to accommodate new people in the posts to be filled up by the petitioners only. It was also done to frustrate the claims of the petitioners’ appointment in those posts.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned notice, the petitioners have moved this Court and obtained the Rule Nisi.<br/> <br/>The respondent No. 1 entered appearance by filing an affidavit in opposition. The case of the Respondents in brief is that although recommendation were given in respect of 11 petitioners of the instant writ petition for the posts of Assistant Director on 06.06.2007, but this recommendation does not ensure their appointment as their character and antecedents report along with medical fitness from the concerned authorities were required to be made. There were some complaints repeatedly published in different newspapers about the malpractices of the said recommendation for selection of those 11 numbers for the post of Assistant Directors and those allegations were received from varied categories of persons. There were some rumours about manipulation and gradually as the said matter of malpractice was raised and voiced through different electronic and print media, some of the members and officials of the Public Service Commission were compelled to resign in a body. Despites all these, the police and intelligence departments were asked to report about those recommended candidates as part of their appointment process and as a result their medical examination had been kept in abeyance until receipt of that report so called for.<br/> <br/>On 01.11.2009, the Public Service Commission received the necessary police report from the Ministry of Home Affairs but the period of No-Objection (NOC), issued by the Ministry of Establishment for appointment had expired before 01.11.2009. Although the Ministry of Establishment was asked to extend the period of NOC for appointment of the Assistant Directors but the said Ministry has not yet issued the NOC for appointment rather the said Ministry has asked for some queries and as a result of which appointment of the 11 numbers of Assistant Directors could not be made.<br/> <br/>Mr. Salahuddin Dolon, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners at the outset submits that the Public Service Commission is a constitutional body which cannot keep a list of selected candidates pending for an indefinite period of time. The impugned letter dated 30.06.2010 manifestly proves that the vacancies are still available and the petitioners who had been selected long time back, the PSC with a malafide motive is now trying to attempt and fill up those posts by appointing other persons which is not justified. The learned Advocate points out that the petitioners have all been selected through a rigorous recruitment process and it is their legitimate expectation that they would be appointed. Mr. Dolon further contends that all the successful candidates have already acquired vested and indefeasible right to be appointed in the vacant posts of Assistant Directors. Mr. Dolon vehemently argues that the PSC does not have any unguided and arbitrary power to deny the appointment of the petitioners without any rhyme or reason when all the petitioners have been selected to be qualified to be appointed to the posts of Assistant Directors. He argues that the petitioners due to the age are now barred from applying for a new Government job afresh and the PSC has put all of them into serious uncertainty by delaying their appointments. Mr. Dolon strenuously argues that the PSC has adopted a dilatory tactics to appoint the petitioners on one hand and on the other hand has taken an attempt to fill up the vacant posts of Assistant Directors by appointing others which is clear case of “Double Standard” and a high handed action of the PSC.<br/> <br/>Per contra, Mr. Mokleshur Rahman, the learned Deputy Attorney General submits that the petitioners although were informed through registered that they were given recommendation for selection of Assistant Director by the Secretariat of the Public Service Commission but this does not ensure their appointment. He next submits that as rumours were spread with regard to the manipulation and malpractice through different electronic media, the appointment process could not be completed. The learned DAG further points out that since some of the members and officials of the Public Service Commission were compelled to resign in a body, the intelligence department took sometime to submit the police verification report for which the process of appointment has been kept in abeyance.<br/> <br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the parties, perused the writ petition, its annexures, affidavit in opposition filed by respondent no.1 and the annexures thereto and other materials on record.<br/> <br/>In unfolding the events which resulted in filing of this petition under Article 102 of the Constitution, it is necessary to recapitulate the sequence of dates as it appears from the record. Admittedly, pursuant to an advertisement dated 5.10.2005, the petitioners applied for the post of Assistant Director under the Bangladesh Public Service Commission Secretariat. It appears from the record that these petitioners went through a rigorous selection process of written and vice voce examination and were found suitable. They were then supplied with the prescribed forms for Police verification on 6.6.2007 which were filled up and submitted. No adverse report was found against any of the petitioners. The Ministry of Home Affairs vide its letter dated 1.11.2009 had cleared by giving security clearance. Instead of completing with the formalities, the Public Service Commission kept the matter of appointment of the petitioners pending and that too without any rhyme or reason. Faced with these facts, the impugned letter dated 30.6.2010 was passed which asked the Secretary, Ministry of Establishment to fill up 6 vacant posts of Assistant Director from qualified candidates of the 28<sup>th</sup> BCS Examination. Now, the question that arises for consideration in the instant application is whether the said impugned letter can be termed ex facie illegal, malafide and without lawful authority.<br/> <br/>The principle of recruitment by open competition aims at ensuring equality of opportunity in the matter of employment and obtaining the services of the most meritorious candidates. Rule of law shall have to prevail in service jurisprudence. However, right to employment has not been transformed into a fundamental right under our Constitution, yet consideration on fair and equitable basis in employment is a right guaranteed to a person. It is not disputed that on the date of publication of advertisement and thereafter on the date of publication of the qualified candidates, the petitioners duly stood to satisfy the entire requisite criterion, including the age-limit. Ordinarily, any advertisement merely amounts to an invitation of qualified candidates to apply for recruitment and on their selection they do not acquire any right to the post. Unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate, the State or any of its instrumentalities is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies. However, it does not mean that the State or the authority concern has the licence of acting in an arbitrary manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken bona fide for appropriate reasons. As already found by this Court that the petitioners had all been selected though a rigorous selection process of both written and viva voce examination, the PSC on different dates had published several notifications almost in all the National Dailies to know the antecedents of the petitioners but no complaint was received against any of the petitioners. The local police, Special Branch, National Security Intelligence had paid repeated visits in the present as well as the permanent addresses of the petitioners for police verification but found nothing adverse against the petitioners.  The Ministry of Home Affairs vide its letter dated 1.11.2009 had cleared by giving security clearance. For convenience and clarity, the letter dated 1.11.2009 is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;">গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ সরকার<br/>স্বরাষ্ট্র  মন্ত্রণালয়<br/>নিরাপত্তা-৪ অধিশাখা।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">স্বঃমঃ(নিরা-৪)/ ভেরিফিকেশন-১/০৯/৯৬৯৬   তারিখঃ০১.১১.২০০৯<br/>বিষয়ঃ সহকারী পরিচালক পদে চাকুরীর জন্য প্রাথমিকভাবে মনোনীত প্রার্থীদের প্রাক-পরিচয় যাচাই প্রসঙ্গে<br/>সূত্রঃ বাংলাদেশ সরকারী কর্ম কমিশন সচিবালয়ের স্মারক নং- বাসককস/ প্রশা-১/সঃসুঃপঃপু-২১/২০০৩(অংশ-১)৫৯৩ তারিখঃ০৫.০৭.২০০৯<br/>উপর্যুক্ত বিষয় ও সুত্রের প্রেক্ষিতে বাংলাদেশ সরকারী কর্ম কমিশন সচিবালয়ের সহকারী পরিচালকের শূন্য ১১ (এগার) টি পদে প্রাথমিক ভাবে মনোনীত প্রার্থীদের নির্ধারিত ছক পূরণপূর্বক প্রাক-পরিচয় যাচাই সংত্র্রান্ত তদন্ত প্রতিবেদনের ছায়ালিপি এতদসঙ্গে সংযুক্ত করা হল।<br/><strong><u>এমতাবস্থায়, উক্ত পদে নিয়োগের নিমিত্ত ১১(এগার) জন প্রার্থীর নিরাপত্তা ছাড়পত্র প্রদানে অনাপত্তি নির্দেশত্র্রমে জ্ঞাপন করা হইল।</u></strong> <strong><em>(underlining is ours)</em></strong></div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: right;">(বিপুল চন্দ্র রায়)<br/>উপ-সচিব<br/>ফোনঃ ৭১৭১৭০৫</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">সচিব<br/>বাংলাদেশ সরকারী কর্ম কমিশন সচিবালয়<br/>পুরাতন বিমানবন্দর ভবন<br/>তেজগাঁও, ঢাকা।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The second point to be addressed is whether the petitioners have acquired an indefeasible right to be appointed and whether they have acquired any legitimate expectation that they would be appointed.<br/> <br/>The doctrine of "legitimate expectation" has its genesis in the field of administrative law. In <strong><em><u>Attorney General of Hong Kong Vs. Ng Yuen Shiu</u></em></strong> [1983] 2 AC 629, a leading case on the Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation, Lord Fraser said: <em>“when a public authority has promised to follow a certain procedure, it is in the interest of good administration that it should act fairly and should implement its promise, so long as the implementation does not interfere with its statutory duty.” </em><br/> <br/>Legitimate expectation is not the same thing as anticipation. It is distinct and different from a desire and hope. It is based on a right. It is grounded in the rule of law as requiring regularity, predictability and certainty in the Government's dealings with the public and the doctrine of legitimate expectation operates both in procedural and substantive matters. If a denial of legitimate expectation in a given case amounts to denial of right guaranteed or is arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or violation of principles of natural justice, the same can be questioned. It can be one of the grounds to consider but the court must lift the veil and see whether the decision is violative of these principles warranting interference. The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non- arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision making process. Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable or legitimate in the context is a question of fact in each case. While lifting such veil in the instant case, we find that the Respondents considered the petitioners’ applications after proper scrutiny and found them to be in order and accordingly, issued admit cards and allowed them to sit for the written test. The petitioners also faced viva voce examination and came out successful. The police verifications were done and no adverse report was found. When all legal formalities were completed for recruitment of the petitioners, it was their legitimate expectation that they would be appointed in the posts of Assistant Director. We are of the view that some amount of dubiousness on the part of the Respondents have creped in when the police verification report was not supplied for a long period of time in spite of the fact that neither any allegation was found against any of the petitioners nor any adverse report was furnished against any of them. To recapitulate once again, we note that prescribed forms for Police verification was supplied on 6.6.2007 which were filled up and submitted, security clearance was given on 1.11.2009 by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the impugned letter was passed on 30.6.2010 while keeping the matter of appointment of the petitioners pending.<br/> <br/>The Government does not have the licence of acting in an arbitrary manner and is always obliged to act fairly and reasonably even where the other party has no legal right. The process of selection in this case was long-drawn and the petitioners and their families have been waiting for a long time with great hope that they would be appointed in the posts of Assistant Director. We further take into account that the appointments of these petitioners were not even cancelled. The fact remains that the petitioners are yet to be appointed and for no fault of them, they all have become over-aged by now and have acquired an indefeasible right to be appointed which cannot be legitimately denied when no adverse finding appeared against any of the petitioners. In fact, the feeble attempt of the learned Deputy Attorney General with regard to the malpractice and manipulation adopted during selection of the petitioners relying upon the Affidavit in Opposition pale into total insignificance and cannot be given any weightage as they clearly offend the reason, justice, fair play as discussed above.<br/> <br/>On the score of malafides, we observe that Governmental action must be based on utmost good faith, belief and ought to be supported with reason, but if the action is otherwise or runs counter to the same, the action cannot but be ascribed to be mala fide. In this context, we find substance in the submission canvassed by Mr.Dolon that the PSC has adopted a dilatory tactics to appoint the petitioner on one hand and on the other hand has taken an attempt to fill up the vacant posts of Assistant Directors which is clear case of “Double Standard” and a high handed action of the PSC. Furthermore, we cannot lose sight of the fact as evident from Annexure-G series that on 12.06.2007 the Deputy Secretary Administration of the PSC had sent a list of the petitioners to the Director General, Department of Health to take necessary steps for medical examination of the petitioners. Pursuant to the said letter, the office of the Director General vide letter dated 20.06.2007 had requested the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) authority to conduct medical examination of the petitioners. The PSC was under a legal obligation to inform the petitioners to appear before the medical board but for reasons best known to the authority, the same was not communicated to the petitioners. Rather, we note that instead of taking steps for appointment of the petitioners, the PSC issued the impugned letter to the Secretary, Ministry of Establishment seeking sanction to fill up 6 vacant posts of Assistant Director from qualified candidates of the 28<sup>th</sup> BCS Exam-ination which is nothing but a malafide action. A provision which leaves an unbridled power to an authority cannot in any sense be characterised as reasonable. When discreti-onary power is conferred on an administrative authority, it must be exercised according to law. When the mode of exercising a valid power is improper or unreasonable, there is an abuse of the power. In<u> <strong><em>State of Andhra Pradesh and Another. v. Nalla Raja Reddy and Others</em></strong></u>  reported in AIR 1967 SC 1458, the Court observed: <em>"Official arbitrariness is more subversive of the doctrine of equality than statutory discrimination. In respect of a statu-tory discrimination one knows where he stands, but the wand of official arbitrariness can be waved in all directions indiscriminately."</em><br/>On a perusal of the matter and the records in its entirety, we are constrained to hold that the Rule has merit and is bound to succeed.<br/>Accordingly, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned letter dated 30.06.2010 as in Annexure-L to this petition is without application of mind and the same is declared to have been passed without lawful authority and of no legal effect. The Respondents are further directed to appoint the petitioners in the posts of Assistant Director under the Bangladesh Public Service Commission Secretariat within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment and order.<br/> <br/>There is, however, no order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The opposite party, by the judgment and order dated 26.10.1999, passed by the learned additional Sessions Judge, Chapai Nawabgonj in Session Case No. 149 of 1997, was also convicted under section 364 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3(three) years. The opposite party preferred Appeals No. 2862 and 3022 of 1999 before the High Court Division and since before the submission of the nomination papers, he was on bail in both the Appeals.</strong><br/><strong>It appears from the Affidavit filed by the opposite party with his nomination paper that even he did not fill up the column no. 2, Kha of the prescribed form of the Affidavit which provides for giving information on any pending criminal case filed against the concerned candidate and the position of the case. Thus the Affidavit gives an information as if no case was pending against the opposite party on the date of submission and scrutiny of the nomination paper.</strong><br/><strong>The opposite-party provided untrue information</strong><strong> in the said affidavit filed along with his nomination paper and also deliberately concealed from the affidavit the said two criminal cases, which at the stage of appeal were pending in the High Court Division. Section 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) of the said Ain, 2009 stipulates that a person shall be disqualified for election as, or for being, the Mayor or a Councillor of any Pourasava if he provides any untrue information in or deliberately conceals any information from the affidavit filed along with the nomination paper. Therefore, in view of the facts and the provisions of Section 19(2) (Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009, the opposite-party was disqualified for election as, or for being, the Councillor (General), Ward No.9, Shibgonj Pourasava.... (16, 18, 20 and 25) </strong><br/> <br/><strong>Local Government (Pourasava) Act (LVIII of 2009)</strong><br/><strong>Section 19 (2)(Gha)</strong><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 426 (1), (2), 366 and 367 (1)(2)</strong><br/><strong>Explaining the law relating to the qualifications</strong><strong> and disqualifications of the candidates for the Pourasava Election, 2010-2011, the Election Commission vide Memo No. </strong><strong>নিকস/ পৌরসভা-পরিঃ /২(১)/২০১০/২০১১</strong><strong> dated 09.12.2010 made Circular</strong><strong> No. 6. Clause (2) of the said Circular made explaining section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 stipulates that any candidate shall remain disqualified for such election even if he has been, on filing appeal against the conviction for any criminal offence or for any offence involving moral turpitude and the sentence to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years, released on bail, unless the execution of the judgment or  conviction is suspended. On mere suspending the execution of the sentence and releasing the appellant on bail or on his own bond by the Appellate Court, the execution of the order appealed against does not become <em>ifso facto</em> suspended under section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the Appellate Court is to pass a specific order assigning reasons in writing for suspending the execution of the order appealed against. As per section 367(1), (2) read with section 366(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the ordering portion of the judgment of any Criminal Court of original jurisdiction in every trial on the case filed on the allegation of any offence contains the order of conviction and sentence. Therefore, unless the order of conviction and sentence is set aside or the execution thereof is suspended on appeal, the same remains in force in all its rigour. Consequently, the disqualification attached to such conviction and sentence also applies to the appellant pending decision on the appeal unless otherwise specifically provided in the relevant statute. . . .(29, 32, 34 and 44)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Local Government (Pourasava) Act (LVIII of 2009)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 19(2)(Gha), 19(2)(Dauntanya Na), 32(1)</strong><strong> (Uma), 32(1)(Ja) and 33(1)(Ka). </strong><br/><strong>The disqualification</strong><strong> stipulated under Section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 for election </strong><strong>as, or for being, a Councillor of the Pourasava</strong><strong> has been operative all along against opposite party No. 1, who was disqualified under section 19(2) (Gha) and 19(2) (Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009 for election, and he provided untrue information in the affidavit filed along with his nomination paper and </strong><strong>also deliberately concealed from the affidavit</strong><strong> two criminal cases and as such, he is removable from the said office of Councillor under section 32(1)(Uma) and section 32(1) (Ja) of the said Act, 2009.

Since the circular was made for conducting the Pourasava election, it was generally applicable to all such elections and as such, the Returning Officer of Shibgonj was also bound to follow the circular.

The petitioner and the opposite party were candidates for the post of Councillor (General) of Ward No.9 of that Pourasava. Section 19(1) and 19(2) of the স্থানীয় সরকার (পৌরসভা) আইন, ২০০৯’ [Local Government (Pourasava) Act, 2009, hereinafter referred to as the said Act, 2009] respectively provides for the qualifications and disqualifications of the contesting candidates for the election of any Pourasava. In Circular No.6 dated 09.12.2010 the provisions of qualifications and disqualific-ations of such candidates were elaborately explained. As per section 19(3) of the said Act, 2009, any candidate requires to file an affidavit as to that he is not disqualified under section 19 (2) of the said Act, 2009. Rule 12 of the স্থানীয় সরকার (পৌরসভা) নির্বাচন বিধিমালা, ২০১২ [Local Government (Pourasava) Election Rules, 2010, hereinafter referred to as the said Election Rules, 2010] provides for submission of nomination papers to which the affidavit is to be attached. Rule 12 of the said Election Rules, 2010 also provides for filling up a prescribed form providing information, amongst others, that whether at present the concerned candidate is an accused in any criminal case and whether there is any record of past criminal case against him and if any what was the judgment therein. After expiry of the stipulated period for filing objection against nomination papers, the petitioner came to know that the opposite party was convicted in a Criminal Case and he was sentenced to suffer 10 years’ imprisonment and though he was on bail, his conviction was not suspended. In addition thereto, in another Criminal Case, the opposite party was convicted and though in that case he was granted bail, the conviction was not suspended. Soon after coming to know about the said convictions and sentences of opposite party No.1, on 22.12.2010 the petitioner filed an objection petition against the nomination paper of the opposite-party to the Returning Officer. As per Circular No.6 dated 09.12.2010, any candidate even if is on bail, he shall be disqualified from the election, unless the conviction and sentence are suspended. But after receiving the said objection, the Returning Officer himself did not take any action in this regard, but he forwarded the said objection to the Secretary of the Election Commission vide Memo No. অ/শিবঃ/পৌর নির্বাচন/২০১০/১২৯ dated 23.12.2010. However, the Secretary, Election Commission also did not take any action in this regard. Even, in the absence of any objection filed by the petitioner, the Returning Officer ought to have cancelled the nomination paper of the opposite party  upon considering the provision of and the information given in the column Nos. ‘2.Kha.’ and ‘3.Kha.’. Conceal-ment of information was a violation of the provision of the said Act, 2009, Election Rules, 2010 and said Circular No.6 as well. Since the convictions of the opposite party were not suspended, he was disqualified for the election. The Returning Officer in his memo dated 23.12.2010 mentioned that the  opposite party was convicted and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years in G.R. No.97 of 1997 arising out of Mostafapur Police Station Case No.13 dated 31.03.1997, and he was on bail granted by the High Court Division. In addition thereto, the  opposite party was also convicted and sentenced in G.R.No.96 of 1997. He was also on bail in that case. The Returning Officer also mentioned in his memo that though the opposite party was on bail, the convictions were not suspended and as such, the opposite party did not provide the correct information in his affidavit. As the convictions passed against him were not suspended on the date of filing of the nomination paper, the opposite party was not qualified for contesting the election, but the election of the Pourasava was held on 12.01.2011 in which the opposite party obtained 1307 votes, while the petitioner secured 1215 votes. Since the Returning Officer and the Election Commission did not take any step against the opposite party the petitioner had to wait for publication of the Gazette Notification declaring the result of the election. On 24.01.2011 the Gazette Notification containing the result of the election of Shibgonj Pourasava was published. By the said Gazette Notification, the opposite party was declared elected Councillor of Ward No.9 of the Pourasava. Since the opposite party was disqualified from contesting the election, the petitioner filed the Election Case for cancellation of the election of the opposite party and for a declaration that he is the elected Councillor of the said Ward. The cause of action of the Election Case arose on 24.01.2011, when the Gazette Notification containing the result of the election of Shibgonj Pourasava was published.<br/> <br/>The opposite party contested the Election Case by filing a Written Objection denying all the material allegations made in the Election Petition and contended, inter alia, that at the time of submission and scrutiny of the nomina-tion papers, neither the election petitioner nor anybody else raised any objection against his nomination paper and as such, the Returning Officer found his nomination paper valid. Since he secured 1307 votes and the election petitioner secured only 1215 votes, he was rightly declared elected. After publication of the Gazette Notification, he has been condu-cting and performing the function of the post of Councillor. It was totally false that he provided any false information in his affidavit. The High Court Division acquitted him of the charge on which he was convicted and sentenced to suffer 10 years’ imprisonment by the Trial Court and as such, the Election Petition containing false and harassing statements is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>During trial the election petitioner himself was examined as P.W.1 and a Steno-Typist of the Upazila Election Office namely Md. Robiul Islam was examined as P.W.2; while, the opposite party was examined as O.P.W.1. Both the parties adduced some documentary evidences in support of their respective cases.<br/> <br/>Having considered the material evidence on record, the Election Tribunal by the judgment and order dated 24.07.2011 allowed the Election Case cancelling the election of the opposite party and declaring the petitioner as the elected Councillor (General) of Ward No.9, Shibgonj Pourasava.<br/> <br/>Against the judgment and order of the Election Tribunal, the  opposite party  preferred Election Appeal No.1 of 2011 in the Election Appellate Tribunal, Chapai Nawabgonj.<br/> <br/>Then, after hearing the appeal, the Election Appellate Tribunal by the judgment and order dated 11.01.2012 allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and order of the Election Tribunal.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of the Election Appellate Tribunal, the election-petitioner preferred the instant Civil Revision and obtained the Rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Alamgir Mostafizur Rahman, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the Election Appellate Tribunal having misconstrued section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure came to the erroneous finding that on granting bail the conviction and sentence become suspended and thereupon the Election Appellate Tribunal failed to appreciate that opposite party No.1 being convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years was disqualified for election as, or for being, the Councillor as per section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009, and thus, the Election Appellate Tribunal committed errors of law resulting in errors in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioner further submits that it is apparent from the face of the affidavit solemnized before the Notary Public by opposite party, which was filed with his nomination paper, that even he did not fill up Column ‘2.Kha.’of the prescribed form of the affidavit, which requires providing infor-mation whether the candidate is an accused in any Criminal Case and if so, what is the position thereof, and as such the opposite party concealed the information in his affidavit that he was convicted in two Criminal Cases and thereupon the Election Appellate Tribunal failed to appreciate that for deliberately providing untrue information in or concealing the information from the affidavit, his nomination paper as well as his candidature was liable to be cancelled as per section 19(2) (Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009 and Rule 14(3)(Uma) read with Rule ‘12(3) (Ga) (Dirgha-E) (2)’ of the said Election Rules, 2010 inasmuch as for the same reason the election of the  opposite party is liable to be cancelled and he also is liable to be removed from his office as per 32(1)(Uma), (Ja) read with section ‘19(2)(Gha), (Dauntanya Na)’of the said Act, 2009 and thereupon the Election Appellate Tribunal came to the erroneous decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Taj Muhammad Shaikh, learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party submits that since upon preferring appeal against the conviction and sentence, the opposite party was released on bail, the conviction and sentence awarded against him became automatically suspended and as such, he was not disqualified for election to the post and therefore, the Election Appellate Tribunal rightly allowed the appeal.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the opposite party further submits that section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 contemplates the final conviction, and appeal preferred against any judgment and order of conviction and sentence being the continuation of the original proceeding, during pendency of the appeal the conviction and sentence appealed from cannot be legally contemplated as final and as such, section 19(2) of the said Act, 2009 does not attract the present case and therefore, the Election Appellate Tribunal rightly allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and order of the Election Tribunal and hence, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>In support of his contention, the learned Advocate referred to the case of <em>Hussain Muhammad Ershad Vs. Abdul Muqtadir Chowdhury and another</em>, reported in <em>10 BLT 148.</em><br/> <br/>I have perused the Civil Revision Application and also perused the records of the Election Tribunal and those of the Election Appellate Tribunal and heard the learned Advocates from both the sides.<br/> <br/>Admittedly, the petitioner and the opposite party were contesting candidates for the post of Councillor (General) of Ward No.9, Shibgonj Pourasava. It is also not disputed that the opposite party was convicted by Special Tribunal No.2, Chapai Nawabgonj in Special Tribunal Case No. 85 of 1997 arisen out of G.R. No. 97 of 1997 corresponding to Gomostapur Police Station Case No.13 dated 31.03.1997 under section 19-A and 19(f) of the Arms Act, and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years. By the judgment and order dated 26.10.199 passed by the Court of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chapai Nawabgonj in Sessions Case No. 14 of 1997 arisen out of G.R. No.96 of 1997 corresponding to Shibgonj Police Station Case No.19 dated 31.03.1997 he was also convicted under section 364 of the Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3(three) years and to pay a fine of Taka-1000/-, in default to pay the fine, to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for 3 (three) months. It is also not disputed that the opposite party preferred appeals being Criminal Appeal Nos. 2862 of 1999 and 3022 of 1999 against the convictions and sentences passed in the said two Criminal Cases respectively, and since before the date of submission of the nomination papers, he was on bail in both the appeals.<br/> <br/>Therefore, on the dates of submission and scrutiny of the nomination papers, both the criminal appeals were pending.<br/> <br/>But it appears from the affidavit filed by the opposite party with his nomination paper that even he did not fill up Column No. ‘2.Kha.’ of the prescribed form of the affidavit, which provides for giving information on any pending Criminal Case filed against the concerned candidate and the position of the case. Thus, the affidavit gives an impression as if no case was pending against the opposite-party on the dates of submission and scrutiny of the nomination papers.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the opposite-party provided untrue information in the said affidavit filed along with his nomination paper and also deliberately concealed from the affidavit the said two criminal cases, which at the stage of appeal were pending in the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>Section 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) of the said Ain, 2009 stipulates that a person shall be disqualified for election as, or for being, the Mayor or a Councillor of any Pourasava if he provides any untrue information in or deliberately conceals any information from the affidavit filed along with the nomination paper. Section 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009 reads as follows:<br/> <br/>“<strong>১৯। মেয়র এবং কাউন্সিলরগণের যোগ্যতা ও অযোগ্যতা।</strong>-(১)------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------<br/>(২) কোন ব্যক্তি মেয়র বা কাউন্সিলর পদে নির্বাচিত হইবার জন্য এবং উক্তরূপ মেয়র বা কাউন্সিলর পদে থাকিবার যোগ্য হইবেন না, যদি তিনি-<br/>(ক) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>(ন) মনোনয়নপত্রের সাথে দাখিলকৃত হলফনামায় কোন অসত্য তথ্য প্রদান করেন বা ইচ্ছাকৃতভাবে কোন তথ্য গোপন করেন।”<br/> <br/>Section 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) construes that no person shall furnish any untrue inform-ation in or deliberately conceal any information from the affidavit filed along with the nomination paper, but if he does so, he shall be disqualified for election as, or for being, the Mayor or a Councillor of any Pourasava.<br/> <br/>Thus, Section 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) entails the consequence of furnishing  any untrue information in or deliberately concealing any information from the affidavit filed along with the nomination paper by any person as to rendering himself disqualified for election as, or for being, the Mayor or a Councillor of any Pourasava.<br/> <br/>Hence, the provision of section 19(2) (Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009 is mandatory in nature without any ambiguity.<br/> <br/>It has already been found that the opposite-party provided untrue information in the affidavit filed along with his nomination paper and also deliberately concealed from the affidavit the two criminal cases, which at the stage of appeal were pending in the High Court Division at that relevant time.<br/> <br/>Therefore, in view of the facts and the provisions of Section 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009, the opposite-party was disqualified for election as, or for being, the Councillor (General), Ward No.9, Shibgonj Pourasava.<br/> <br/>It also appears from the records as well as from the Written Objection filed by the opposite party that after the election, he was acquitted of the charge brought against him in G.R. No.97 of 1997. But, he concealed G.R. No.96 of 1997, the conviction and sentence passed therein and Criminal Appeal No.3022 of 1999 preferred against the same from the Written Objection and his deposition as well. From the record of Criminal Appeal No.3022 of 1999 it appears that the appeal is still pending in the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>Now, the question arises, while the opposite party was on bail whether or not he was disqualified for election as, or for being, a Councillor under the said Act, 2009.<br/> <br/>It has already been found that the opposite party No.1 was convicted in two Criminal Cases and sentenced to two separate terms each not less than two years and, he was also on bail upon preferring appeals against the same. Section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 stipulates that a person shall be disqualified for election as, or for being, the Mayor or a Councillor of any Pourasava if he has been, on conviction for any criminal offence or for any offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years, unless a period of five years has elapsed since his release. Section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 reads as follows:<br/> <br/>“<strong>১৯। মেয়র এবং কাউন্সিলরগণের যোগ্যতা ও অযোগ্যতা।</strong>-(১)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>(২) কোন ব্যক্তি মেয়র বা কাউন্সিলর পদে নির্বাচিত হইবার জন্য এবং উক্তরূপ মেয়র বা কাউন্সিলর পদে থাকিবার যোগ্য হইবেন না, যদি তিনি-<br/>(ক) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>(ঘ) কোন ফৌজাদরী বা নৈতিক স্খলনজনিত অপরাধে দোষী সাব্যস্থ হইয়া অন্যুন দুই বৎসর কারাদন্ডে দন্ডিত হন এবং তাঁহার মুক্তি লাভের পর পাঁচ বৎসর কাল অতিবাহিত না হইয়া থাকে;<br/>----------------------------------------------”<br/> <br/>Further explaining the law relating to the qualifications and disqualifications of the candidates for the Pourasava Election, 2010-2011, the Election Commission vide Memo No. wbKm/‡cŠimfv-cwit/2(1)/2010/2011 dated 09.12.2010 made Circular No.6. Clause (2) of the said Circular made explaining section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 stipulates that any candidate shall remain disqualified for such election even if he has been, on filing appeal against the conviction for any criminal offence or for any offence involving moral turpitude and the sentence to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years, released on bail, unless the execution of the judgment or  conviction is suspended. The said Clause (2) reads as follows:<br/> <br/><strong>(২) ফৌজদারী মামলার সাজা আইনের ধারা ১৯(২)(ঘ)</strong><strong>:</strong> কোন প্রার্থী ফৌজদারী বা নৈতিক স্খলনজনিত অপরাধে দোষী সাব্যস্থ  হয়ে অন্যুন ২ বৎসর কারাদন্ডে দন্ডিত হলে এবং উক্ত অধ্যাদেশের বিরুদ্ধে উচ্চ আদালতে আপীল হলে এবং আপীল আদালত নিমণ আদালতের রায় বা সাজা স্থগিত না করলে সংশ্লিষ্ট প্রার্থী নির্বাচনে অযোগ্য হবেন। এক্ষেত্রে উচ্চ আদালত আপীল গ্রহণ করলেও তিনি অযোগ্য হবেন বা সংশ্লিষ্ট প্রার্থী জামিন পেলেও অযোগ্য হবেন অর্থাৎ সংশ্লিষ্ট সাজা স্থগিত না হওয়া পর্যন্ত নির্বাচনে অযোগ্য হবেন।”<br/><br/>With regard to suspension of the execution of the sentence or order appealed against and releasing the appellant on bail or on his own bond pending the appeal, section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as under:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<strong>426. Suspension of sentence pending</strong><strong> appeal, Release of appellant on bail.- (1)</strong> Pending any appeal by a convicted person, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by it in writing, order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed against be suspended and, also, if he is in confinement, that he be released on bail or on his own bond.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The above-quoted section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure confers power to the Appellate Court to suspend the execution of the sentence and grant bail, and also to suspend the execution of the order appealed against.<br/> <br/>Thus, on mere suspending the execution of the sentence and releasing the appellant on bail or on his own bond by the Appellate Court, the execution of the order appealed against does not become <em>ifso facto</em> suspended under section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the Appellate Court is to pass a specific order assigning reasons in writing for suspending the execution of the order appealed against.<br/> <br/>As per section 367(1) read with section 366(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the judgment in every trial in any Criminal Court of original jurisdiction contains the point or points for determination, the reasons for coming to the decision thereon and the decision. The decision, as practiced, is passed in the form of an order. Section 367(2) of the Code dictates that every such judgment shall specify the offence (if any) of which, and the section of the Penal Code or other law under which, the accused is convicted, and the punishment to which he is sentenced.<br/> <br/>Therefore, as per section 367(1), (2) read with section 366(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the ordering portion of the judgment of any Criminal Court of original jurisdiction in every trial on the case filed on the allegation of any offence contains the order of conviction and sentence.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, in such a case, an appeal is filed against the judgment and, order of conviction and sentence; although the order of sentence can be independently challenged if it is harsh and disproportionate to the established guilt, in that case the order of conviction is deemed to have been conceded by the convict-appellant.<br/> <br/>Moreover, no accused can be sentenced unless he is convicted. Therefore, the order of conviction is the substantive order and the order of sentence is merely consequential thereto.<br/> <br/>No doubt, on releasing the appellant on bail or on his own bond, the execution of the order of sentence to imprisonment practically becomes <em>ifso facto</em> suspended inasmuch as even it is beyond the power of the Appellate Court to suspend the sentence itself; because, under section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Appellate Court can only suspend the execution of the sentence pending disposal of the appeal and thus, on mere suspension of the execution of the sentence the order of conviction does not <em>ifso facto</em> lose its effect.<br/> <br/>Hence, even after releasing the appellant on bail or on his own bond the order of conviction still remains operative.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the ‘order appealed against’ as appears in section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure includes the order of conviction in every criminal appeal, which is preferred against the judgment and, order of conviction and sentence.<br/> <br/>Usually, after being released on bail or on his own bond a convict-appellant does not need to get the order of conviction suspended or stayed. But in certain situations, the order of conviction may incur a disqualification provided for in any other statute and unless the execution of the order of conviction is suspended or stayed the damage done thereupon cannot be undone. In similar situations, the Supreme Court of India in the case of <em>B.R. Kapur v. State of T.N. &amp; another, (2001) 7 SCC 231</em> held as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“It is not within the power of the appellate court to suspend the sentence; it can only suspend the execution of the sentence pending the disposal of appeal. The suspension of the execution of the sentence does not alter or affect the fact that the offender has been convicted of a grave offence and has attracted the sentence of imprisonment of not less than two years. The suspension of the  execution of the sentences, therefore, does not remove the disqualification against the second respondent. The suspension of the sentence, as the Madras High Court erroneously called it, was in fact only the suspension of the execution of the sentences pending the disposal of the appeals filed by the second respondent. The fact that she secured the suspe-nsion of the execution of the sentences against her did not alter or affect the convictions and the sentences imposed on her and she remained disqualified from seeking legislative office under Section 8(3).”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/> <br/>In the present case, on filing appeal, though the opposite party has been released on bail under section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, at his peril he has not even sought for and obtained any order of suspension of the execution of the order of conviction passed in the said Sessions Case No. 14 of 1997 arisen out of G.R. No.96 of 1997 corresponding to Shibgonj Police Station Case No.19 dated 31.03.1997 under section 364 of the Penal Code. Consequently, the said order of conviction, which is even now under challenge in Criminal Appeal No. 3022 of 1999, is still in force.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the conviction was in force on the dates of submission and scrutiny of the nomination paper and, on the dates of holding of the election and publication of the Gazette Notification containing the result of the election and is still in force as well.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for opposite party No.1 submitted that section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 contemplates the final conviction, and the appeal preferred against any judgment and order of conviction and sentence being the continuation of the original proceeding, during pendency of the appeal the conviction and sentence appealed against cannot be legally contemplated as final. It has already been found that even after releasing the appellant on bail or on his own bond the order of conviction still remains operative. Thus, the conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court do not remain in limbo automatically when they are challenged in appeal. It is settled that in criminal jurisprudence an accused is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty upon trial. Accordingly, when the accused is convicted and sentenced such presumption of innocence ends and thus, it cannot be legally said that the presumption of innocence continues even after the conviction. Again the Supreme Court of India held in the said case of <em>B.R. Kapur v. State of T.N. &amp; another, (2001) 7 SCC 231</em> as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“In much the same vein, it was submitted that the presumption of innocence continued until the final judgment affirming the conviction and sentence was passed and, therefore, no disqualification operated as of now against the second respondent. Before we advert to the four judgments relied upon in support of this submission, let us clear the air. When a lower court convicts an accused and sentences him, the presumption that the accused is innocent comes to an end. The conviction operates and the accused has to undergo the sentence. The execution of the sentence can be stayed by an appellate court and the accused released on bail. In many cases, the accused is released on bail so that the appeal is not rendered infructuous, at least in part, because the accused has already undergone imprisonment. If the appeal of the accused succeeds the conviction is wiped out as cleanly as if it had never existed and the sentence is set aside. A successful appeal means that the stigma of the offence is altogether erased. But that it is not to say that the presumption of innocence continues after the conviction by the trial court. That conviction and the sentence it carries operate against the accused in all their rigour until set aside in appeal, and a disqualification that attaches to the conviction and sentence applies as well.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Therefore, unless the order of conviction and sentence is set aside or the execution thereof is suspended on appeal, the same remains in force in all its rigour. Consequently, the disqualification attached to such conviction and sentence also applies to the appellant pending decision on the appeal unless otherwise specifically provided in the relevant statute.<br/> <br/>Section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 contemplates conviction and sentence and not ‘final’ conviction and sentence. Since the legislature in its wisdom made a specific provision for disqualification on conviction by enacting section 19(2)(Gha), it is not for the Court to abridge or expand it. In fact, every conviction and sentence stand final unless the same are set aside on appeal or on revision.<br/> <br/>Nevertheless, section 35 of the said Act, 2009 provides that if having been declared disqualified or removed as per the provisions of this Act the elected Mayor or any elected Councillor of any Pourasava vacates his office, he shall be reinstated in his office for the remaining period of his tenure after such removal is set aside or such disqualification is stamped out on appeal. Section 35 reads as under:<br/> <br/><strong>৩৫। মেয়র ও কাউন্সিলরের সদস্যপদ পুনর্বহাল।-</strong>পৌরসভার কোন নির্বাচিত মেয়র বা কাউন্সিলর এই আইনের বিধান অনুসারে অযোগ্য ঘোষিত হইয়া অথবা অপসারিত হইয়া সদস্যপদ হারাইবার পর আপিলে তাহার উক্তরূপ অপসারণ বাতিল হইলে, বা তাহার অযোগ্যতা অবলোপন হইলে, তিনি অবশিষ্ট মেয়াদের জন্য স্ব-পদে বহাল হইবেন।<br/> <br/>Section 35 of the said Act, 2009 contemplates that on the removal or on the declaration as disqualified as per the provisions of this Act, the Mayor or a Councillor of any Pourasava shall vacate his office at once and once thus he vacates his office, he shall not be reinstated in the office until such removal is set aside or such disqualification is stamped out on appeal.<br/> <br/>Therefore, as per section 35 of the said Act, 2009 the disqualifications contemplated under the Act may remain operative even pending consideration of the appeal and such disqualifications may be wiped out only upon disposal of the appeal and not before it. Accordingly, it cannot be said that unless the conviction becomes final it does not entail the disqualification under section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009.<br/> <br/>Moreover, section 31(1) of the said Act, 2009 provides that when any proceeding for removal of the Mayor or any Councillor of any Pourasava has been started or Charge Sheet has been accepted by the Court in any criminal case against him, if in the opinion of the concerned authority it appears that the exercise of the power of the Mayor or Councillor by him would be detrimental to the interest of the Pourasava or would not be just and proper in the administrative point of view, the Government may by a written order suspend the Mayor or the Councillor from his office. Section 31(1) reads as under:<br/> <br/>“<strong>৩১। মেয়র ও কাউন্সিলরের সাময়িক বরখাস্ত। (১)।-</strong> যেক্ষেত্রে কোন পৌরসভার মেয়র অথবা কোন কাউন্সিলর অপসারণের কার্যক্রম আরম্ভ করা হইয়াছে অথবা তাহার বিরুদ্ধে ফৌজদারী মামলায় অভিযোগপত্র আদালত কর্তৃক গৃহীত হইয়াছে, সেই ক্ষেত্রে নির্ধারিত কর্তৃপক্ষের বিবেচনায় মেয়র অথবা কাউন্সিলর কর্তৃক ক্ষমতা প্রয়োগ পৌরসভার স্বার্থের পরিপন্থী অথবা প্রশাসনিক দৃষ্টিকোণে সমীচীন না হইলে, সরকার লিখিত আদেশের মাধ্যমে মেয়র অথবা কাউন্সিলরকে সাময়িকভাবে বরখাস্ত করিতে পারিবে।”<br/> <br/>While, such sensitive being the implications of the said Act, 2009, it cannot be the intention of the same Act to allow any person, who has already been convicted and the execution of the conviction has not been suspended, to exercise such power of the Mayor or Councillor.<br/> <br/>Hence, section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 does not contemplate any ‘initial’ or ‘final’ conviction and sentence, but the conviction and sentence, which are effective pending consideration of the matter before the election authority, Tribunal or Court.<br/> <br/>The Division Bench of this Court, which passed the judgment and order in the case of <em>Hussain Muhammad Ershad Vs. Abdul Muqtadir Chowdhury and another, reported in 10 BLT 148</em> differed on the issue whether Article 66 (2) (d) of the Constitution contemplates ‘final’ conviction and sentence. His Lordship Mr. Justice Joynul Abedin held that such disqualification starts when the conviction becomes final and conclusive; while, his Lordship Mr. Justice A.B.M. Khairul Haque observed that a Court of Law has got no power to add or omit anything to what is provided in the law itself and this Court can always explain and expound the Constitutional provisions and other laws of the country, but in doing so certainly would never make a detour from such laws or even from the spirit of such laws, and held as under:<br/> <br/>“In this case even the plain meaning of the provision contained in sub-clause (d) of clause (2) under Article 66 is very clear and without any ambiguity. There is no room for doubt in the said provision that on conviction and sentence for a period of not less than two years for an offence involving moral turpitude, a member shall be disqualified at once. Of course, if they are acquitted in appeal, it will be effective retrospectively and the disqualification, if any, would at once cease to exist.”<br/> <br/>Since the two learned Judges of the said Division Bench differed on the issue, this Bench may adopt and rely on either of the views, which may be seemed to be more rational and prudent.<br/> <br/>In view of the discussions made above, the dissenting views taken in the said case of <em>Hussain Muhammad Ershad Vs. Abdul Muqtadir Chowdhury and another</em>, do not come in aid of  the opposite party; rather the view taken by his Lordship Mr. Justice A.B.M. Khairul Haque is adoptable in the contexts of the discussions made above.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the disqualification stipulated under Section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 for election as, or for being, a Councillor of the Pourasava has been operative all along against opposite party No.1.<br/> <br/>Hence, opposite party No.1 has been disqualified under section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 for election as, or for being, the said Councillor.<br/> <br/>In view of the discussions made above, it appears that clause (2) of the said Circular No.6 was made in conformity with the provisions of section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 read with the provision of section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, I also do not find any legal infirmity in making the said circular, and in the contents and implications thereof.<br/> <br/>For any one or more than one of the 8 (eight) reasons enumerated under section 32 of the said Act, 2009, a Mayor or Councillor of any Pourasava may be removed from his office. Particularly, section 32(1)(Uma) and section 32(1)(Ja) respectively stipulates that a Mayor or Councillor shall be removable from his office if after the election, it is proved that he was disqualified under section 19(2) for the election and that he furnished any untrue information in or deliberately concealed any information from the affidavit filed along with the nomination paper. Section 32(1)(Uma) and section 32(1)(Ja) respectively run as follows:<br/> <br/><strong>“৩২। মেয়র ও কাউন্সিলর অপসারণ</strong>।-(১)মেয়র অথবা কাউন্সিলর তাহার নিজ পদ হইতে অপসারণযোগ্য হইবেন, যদি তিনি-<br/>(ক) ------------------------------------------------------------<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>(ঙ) নির্বাচনের পর ইহা প্রমানিত হয় যে, তিনি ধারা ১৯(২) অনুযায়ী নির্বাচনে অযোগ্য ছিলেন;<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>(জ) নির্বাচন অনুষ্ঠানের পর হইতে পৌরসভার মেয়াদকালের মধ্যে যে কোন সময় যদি প্রমানিত হয় যে, কোন নির্বাচিত প্রাথী মনোনয়নপত্রের সাথে দাখিলকৃত সাতটি তথ্য সম্বলিত হলফনামায় কোন অসত্য তথ্য প্রদান করিয়াছেন বা ইচ্ছাকৃতভাবে কোন তথ্য গোপন করিয়াছেন।”<br/> <br/>It has already been found that opposite-party No.1 was disqualified under section 19(2)(Gha) and 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009 for election, and he provided untrue information in the affidavit filed along with his nomination paper and also deliberately concealed from the affidavit two criminal cases and as such, he is removable from the said office of Councillor under section 32(1)(Uma) and section 32(1)(Ja) of the said Act, 2009. <br/> <br/>In any one or more than one of the 6 (six) situations delineated under section 33 of the said Act, 2009, a Mayor or Councillor shall vacate his office, in particular, section 33(1) (Ka) and section 33(1)(Gha) respectively stipulates that the office of a Mayor or Councillor shall fall vacant if he is disqualified under section 19(2) for being such a Mayor or Councillor as the case may be and removed from his office under section 32. Section 33(1)(Ka) and section 33(1)(Gha) read as under:<br/> <br/>“<strong>৩৩। মেয়র এবং কাউন্সিলরের পদ শূন্য হওয়া এবং পুনঃনির্বাচন।</strong>-(১) পৌরসভার মেয়র বা কাউন্সিলর পদ শূন্য হইবে, যদি তিনি-<br/>(ক)  ধারা ১৯(২) এর অধীনে মেয়র অথবা কাউন্সিলর থাকিবার অযোগ্য হন; বা<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>(ঘ) ধারা ৩২ অনুযায়ী অপসারিত হন;”<br/> <br/>Section 33(1)(Ka) and section 33(1) (Gha) also respectively entail consequences of being disqualified under section 19(2) for being a Mayor or Councillor and of being removed under section 32 from such office as to falling the office vacant.<br/> <br/>Thus, the provisions of section 33(1)(Ka) and section 33(1)(Gha) are also mandatory in nature.<br/> <br/>Though the opposite-party is removable from the said office of Councillor, he has yet not been removed and consequently, the said office of Councillor has not been vacant for the reason stipulated under section 33(1)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009.<br/> <br/>However, since the opposite-party  is disqualified under section 19(2)(Gha) and 19(2)(Dauntanya Na) for being elected as, or for being, the said Councillor, the office has become vacant as per the provision of section 33(1)(Ka) of the said Act, 2009.<br/> <br/>It is an established principle of law that circular is not a law and it has no general binding effect of a law. However, it is another long established principle of law that a circular is binding upon the makers thereof and the persons or authority to whom the same is applicable. In this regard the decisions made in the cases of (i) <em>Muzaffar Ali and another Vs. Government of Bangladesh and another</em>, reported in <em>43 DLR (AD) 137</em>, (ii) <em>Administrator, M/s. Delta Constructions Ltd. Vs. Chairman, 2<sup>nd</sup> Labour Court and another</em>, reported in <em>28 DLR 365</em>, (iii) <em>Md. Solaiman Khan and others Vs. Government of Bangladesh and others</em>, reported in <em>12 BLT 342</em> and (iv) <em>Ezahar Ali Mondol and others Vs. Golam Rasul and others</em>, reported in <em>45 DLR 653</em>, may be referred to.<br/> <br/>In the case of <em>R.v. Secretary of State for Home Department Ex parte Khan, (1985) 1 All ER 40 (CA)</em>, it was held that if the authority had made a statement that a certain criterion or procedure would be followed the people can legitimately expect that it would be followed in the decision-making process of the authority, therefore, the authority is under an obligation to follow that criterion or procedure. In that case, in violation of the provision of the circular regarding entry of adopted children in England, the authority had refused entry to the adopted child of Mr. Khan. The court quashed the order of the authority as it was on consideration of policy, which was not in existence when the circular had been issued.<br/> <br/>As the Election Commission by the circular made a statement that the certain criterion or procedure would be followed in scrutinizing the qualification and disqualification of the candidates in any Pourasava election, that very criterion or procedure was binding upon the officers, staff and persons bestowed with the duty to conduct the elections.<br/> <br/>Since the circular was made for conducting the Pourasava election, it was generally applicable to all such elections and as such, the Returning Officer of Shibgonj was also bound to follow the circular.<br/>But the Election Appellate Tribunal having misconstrued section 426(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure came to the erroneous findings that on granting bail the conviction and sentence awarded against any convict became suspended, and in that case neither any separate order of suspension is required nor does any criminal Court pass such order of suspension, in the Rules (contained in the circular) the provisions under section 426 (1) of the Code was misinterpreted and thereby the Election Appellate Tribunal committed errors of law resulting in errors in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Upon elaborate discussion, it has already been found that the opposite-party provided untrue information in the said affidavit filed along with his nomination paper and also deliberately concealed from the affidavit the said two criminal cases, which at the stage of appeal were pending in the High Court Division. But the Election Appellate Tribunal further having misconstrued section 426(1) of the Code came to the erroneous finding that the  opposite party did not furnish any untrue information in the affidavit submitted along with his nomination paper and thereby committed an error of law occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>The opposite party preferred Criminal Appeal Nos. 2862 of 1999 against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed in Special Tribunal Case No. 85 of 1997 and pending disposal of the Election Case the appeal was allowed and he was acquitted of the charge. Accordingly, the acquittal wiped out the conviction with retrospective effect from the date it was recorded and the Election Appellate Tribunal rightly came to the decision so far it relates to Criminal Appeal Nos. 2862 of 1999.<br/>But the Election Appellate Tribunal did not at all consider that Criminal Appeal No. 3022 of 1999 preferred against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 26.10.199 passed in Sessions Case No. 14 of 1997 is still pending, the execution of the conviction appealed against has not been suspended and the disqualification attached to the conviction applies as well and thereby the Election Appellate Tribunal further committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/> <br/>Having failed to appreciate that the doctrine of estoppels cannot be attracted to a case of violation of a statutory provision, the learned Election Appellate Tribunal wrongly held that having admitted the validity of the nomination paper of the opposite party-appellant, as the election petitioner participated in the election and conceded his candidature, he cannot raise the question of validity of the nomination paper of the opposite party-appellant as per section 115 of the Evidence Act.<br/> <br/>It is another established principle of law that the election period starts from the declaration of the election schedule and ends at the publication of the election result in the official Gazette. But having misconceived the election period, the Election Appellate Tribunal erroneously held that the allegation raised against the validity of the nomination paper was a ‘post election dispute’, which occasioned a failure of justice. <br/> <br/>In such view of the matter, the opposite party is disqualified on the following two scores for election as, or for being, the Councillor (General) of Ward No.9, Shibgonj Pourasava:-</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Under section 19(2)(Gha) of the said Act, 2009 for being convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years; and</li><li style="text-align:justify">Under section19(2)(Dauntanya Na) of the said Act, 2009 for providing untrue information in the affidavit filed along with his nomination paper and for deliberately concealing from the affidavit the two criminal cases, which were pending at the stage of appeal in the High Court Division at that relevant time. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, I find merit in the Rule. Hence, the Rule is made absolute.<br/> <br/>The judgment and order passed by the Election Appellate Tribunal is set aside and the judgment and order passed by Election Tribunal is hereby maintained with the findings and observations made above.<br/> <br/>However, there would be no order as to costs.<br/> <br/>Send down the records to the concerned Tribunals at once.<br/> <br/>Send a copy of this judgment to the Election Commission to do the needful in accordance with this judgment and law as well.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

K. M. Zahirul Hoque, J.</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This First Appeal is directed at the instance of the defendant against the judgment and decree dated 27.09.2007 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka decreeing the Title Suit No. 2 of 2007 against the defendant No. 13.<br/><br/>The respondent Nos. 1-9 as the plaintiffs instituted the Title Suit No. 2 of 2007 before the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka for declaration of title in respect of .55 decimals of land as well as also declaration that no title was passed in pursuance of Deed No. 8686 dated 22.10.1990 in favour of the defendant.<br/><br/>The plaintiffs case, in short, is that the land as described in Ka schedule along with other land originally belonged to Kobbat Ali, Sadat Ali, Emdad Ali and Mohammad Ali and their names have been recorded the C. S. Khatian No. 1504 by mentioning 320 decimals of land in 3 C. S. Plot Nos. 4732, 5275 and 5281 and subsequently one of the brother namely Mohammad Ali died as unmarried and leaving behind his 03 brothers as his legal heirs and remaining three brothers disposed of this 320 decimals of land along with other land to Omar Ali, Tableb Ali, Muslim Miah and Ibrahim Miah through a registered Kabala deed dated 09.04.1941 and the names of the purchasers Omar Ali and 03 others have been recorded in S. A. Khatian and subsequently also recorded in R. S. Khatian. It was further case of the plaintiff that an amicable partition took place amongst the brothers of Omar Ali and in pursuance of that partition Omar Ali got the 51 decimals land of R. S. Plot No. 7813 and the other brothers of Omar Ali got the other remaining land of other plots and as per their amicable partition and entered into possession and accordingly their names have been correctly recorded in the R. S. Khatian by mentioning the name of Omar Ali for the land of Suit plot and also mentioning the names of his brothers for the land of other plots and Omar Ali while owing and possessing the ‘Ka’ schedule land he sold out the land of R. S. Plot No. 7813 in favour of one Meherun Nessa through a registered deed dated 26.10.1978 and there also executed and registered a rectifying deed on 24.02.1982 due to mistake of  the C. S. Plot Number  in his earlier deed in favour of Meherun Nessa who mutated her name and used to pay rent for the suit land in favour of the Government. While Meherun Nessa owning and possessing the suit land she sold out the said land in favour of one Mrs. Fuljan Bibi through a registered deed dated 02.08.1983. Then Fuljan Bibi got the possession and mutated her name and used to pay rent in favour of the Government. Thereafter the said Fuljan Bibi sold out the said land to Mrs. Nurjahan Begum on 06.11.1984 and Nurjahan Begum sold out the said land to the plaintiffs on 17.07.1985 through 08 (eight) registered kabala deeds and since then the plaintiffs have been in possession of the suit land by demarcating their boundaries, developing it by erecting houses in where inhabiting plaintiffs tenants thereon. Thereafter the defendants have claimed the suit land on the strength of the exchange deed No. 8686 dated 22.10.1990 and the defendant No. 1 made threat to dispossess the plaintiffs from their possession and also disclosed about the ownership of the defendant No. 1 and others over the suit land. Thereafter the plaintiff obtained disputed deed dated 22.10.1990 as mentioned in the ‘Kha’ schedule of the plaint and filed the suit for declaration of their title as well as declaration that the ‘Kha’ schedule deed dated 22.10.1990 being deed No. 8686  covering  38.25 decimals of land in favour of the defendant does not create any title upon the defendant and hence the suit.<br/><br/>Defendant No. 13 that the present appellant contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the materials allegation of the plaint and stating inter-alia that the suit is not maintainable in its present form. And he further stated that the ownership of the Suit land by four brothers namely Omar Ali Miah, Taleb Miah, Muslim Miah and Ibrahim Miah and contending inter-alia that each of the four brothers got 12.75 decimals of land in C. S. Plot No. 5275, S. A. record was also prepared in the same way reflecting 1/4 share in each plots against each bothers.<br/><br/>The further case of the defendant No. 13 was that after death of Taleb Ali leaving behind his 03 sons namely Motaleb Miah, Shahabuddin Miah and Riazuddin Miah who got 12.75 decimals of land and after death of Muslim Miah leaving behind five sons namely Md. Mishir Ali Miah, Md. Fazlul Hoque Miah, Abdul Hoque Miah, Mokbul Hossen Miah and Ejajul Islam Miah and they also got 12.75 decimals of land as the heirs. Md. Ibrahim Miah, Taleb Ali Miah and Muslim Miah transferred 38.25 decimals of land from Plot No. 5275 vide exchange deed No. 8686 dated 22.11.1990 with the land of Mrs. Lailla Parveem Akhter and said Laila Parveen Akhter transferred 30 decimals of land out of 38.25 decimals of land in favour of Md. Moazzem Hossen Miah on 07.04.1991 and Laila Parveen Akhter also transferred remaining 08.25 decimals of land to Md. Moazzem Hossen on 19.09.1991 thereafter mutating his name in respect of 38.25 decimals of land and used to possess the said land thereafter Moazzem Hossen Miah on 08.11.2001 transferred 38.25 decimals of land in favour of the defendant No. 13 through a exchange deed on 22.10.1990 i. e. Suit deed and handed over the possession to the defendant No. 13 who mutated his name and obtained rent receipt of the suit land.<br/>The further case of the defendant No. 13 that Omar Ali did not owing and possessing the suit land alone and he only got 12.75 out of 51 decimals of land and he also denied the possession of the plaintiffs over the suit land as a whole.<br/><br/>The learned trial Court after considering the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues :-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the suit is maintainable in its present form and manner?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the suit is barred by Article-120 of the</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Limitation Act, 1908?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiffs have possession in the suit land?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiffs have title in the suit land?</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get relief as prayed for?</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">After discussion of the evidence and materials-on-record the trial Court found that the plaintiffs have able to prove their title and possession over the suit land and decreed the suit by the impugned judgment and decree and against which the defendant No. 13 as appellant preferred the present appeal.<br/><br/>Mr. A. J. Muhammad Ali, the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that since the deed in favour of Omar Ali and his three brothers executed and registered on 09.04.1941 in where all are got equal share and in such circumstances Omar Ali got only ¼ land from the suit plot and there was no amicable partition amongst the brothers of Omar Ali therefore the transfer of .51 decimals of land by Omar Ali in favour of Meherunnessa had no right and as such no title in respect of 51 decimals of land has been passed through the said deed dated 26.10.1978 in favour of Maherunnessa as well as subsequent deed by Maherunnessa thus the plaintiffs did not get .51 decimals of land by subsequent deed from Nurjahan Begum on 17.07.1985 but the trial Court failed to consider these material as well as the legal aspect and passed by the impugned judgment. He further submits that the possession over the 51 decimals of land was not proved by the plaintiffs and therefore the impugned judgment for declaration is bad in law as well as against the principle of legal aspect. He further submits that the trial Court also failed to consider the oral as well as documentary evidence that under what circumstances the plaintiffs were able to prove their title and possession over the suit land which was not specifically mentioned by the trial Court therefore the impugned judgment was not a proper judgment.<br/><br/>Mr. A. K. M. Salauddin, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent Nos. 1-9 submits that admittedly the land was owing and possessing by Omar Ali and his three brothers in pursuance of deed dated 09.04.1941, and subsequently an amicable partition was took place amongst the brothers of Omar  Ali after S.A. and before R.S. operation in where Omar Ali also got the land of suit plot alone and his others 3 brothers got their share in the land of other plots of suit Khatian and in pursuance of said amicable partition R.S. Record has been prepared by mentioning the name of Omar Ali against the suit plot and the names of the other brothers have been recorded for the land of other plots of the said R.S. Khatian thereafter said Omar Ali as per R.S. Record sold 51 decimals of land to one Meherun Nessa on 26.10.1978 who sold the same one Fuljan Bibi on 06.11.1964 who sold it to one Nurjahan Begum on 08.04.1985 who thereafter sold out the same in favour of the plaintiffs by eight registered deeds on 17.07.1985 and handed over the possession over the said suit land accordingly plaintiffs are possessing by erecting hut and making boundary in where they are running their business by possessing the suit land since Omar Ali successively and therefore the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court is a proper one. He further submits that the R. S. record of right has a presumptive value as per section 144 A of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act and neither Omar Ali nor his brothers and legal heirs denied the said record of right till now therefore the said record of right is prevailing  and still it is in force. He further submits that since the deed dated 26.10.1978 was acted upon and subsequent deeds in favour of the plaintiffs are also acted upon. He lastly submits that the plaintiff along with P. Ws who categorically stated that Omar Ali alone used to possess the suit land and then the possession has been vested upon the subsequent purchasers the plaintiffs and these materials fact also supported  and corroborated by the material document i. e. mutation and rent receipt recital  of title deeds well proved the plaintiffs title and possession over the suit land therefore the judgment passed by the trial Court is very much legal and proper one.<br/><br/>Heard the learned Advocate for both the sides, perused the plaint as well as the written statement and other materials exhibits including the deposition of the witnesses and the impugned judgment itself.<br/><br/>It appears that admittedly the owner of the land of C. S. Khatian No. 604 who sold the suit land along with other lands infavour of Omar Ali and his three brothers through a registered deed dated 09.04.1941 the that is Exhibit 13 in respect of 3.20 decimals of land including the suit land and in where C. S. plot 5275 covered 51 decimals of land and subsequently the name of possessor Taleb, Muslim, Ibrahim and Omar was record in S. A. Khatian in equal share and S.A. Record prepared accordingly in their names. It was further case thereafter an amicable partition took place and Omar Ali got the land of Suit plot amicably.<br/><br/>It further appears from the plaint as well as deposition of P. W. 1 that an amicable partition took place before 1970 amongst the brothers of Omar Ali and for which Omar Ali got exclusively the land of C.S. and S.A plot No. 5275 and in pursuance of amicable partition R. S. record was prepared. Now the vital point of the case wheather the land of suit plot owned by Omar Ali through an amicable partition amongst his brothers or not?<br/><br/>It appears form the averment of the plaint as well as the deposition of P.W. 1 that an amicable partition took place before 1970 amongst the brothers of Omar Ali for the land of suit Khatian measuring 3.20 acres land covered in C.S. and S.A. Khatian and as per the plaint Omar Ali got 51 decimals of land of C.S. and S.A. plot No. 5275.<br/><br/>It further appears from R. S. Khatian which prepared after 1970 i.e. exhibit 19 in where the name of Omar Ali and his three brothers have been recorded against the land of 08 (eight) plots by mentioning the names of the record tenants as possessors against each of the plots and in where plot No 7813 has been mentioned by covering 51 decimals of land against the name of Omar Ali as tenant and possessor of the said land and which is found the land of suit plot and similarly the name of other brothers of Omar Ali have been mentioned as tenants and possessors for the land of other plots.<br/><br/>We have also gone through the deed dated 26.10.1978 i.e. exhibit 13 in where Omar Ali was the executant for the suit land in favour of one Meherunnessa and  the contention of the said deed to some extent is as under;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/> “নিম্ন তপসিল বর্ণিত সম্পত্তিতে আমি অত্র দলিলদাতা আমার অপর শরিকানগণ সহ খরিদ করতঃ খরিদমূলে মালিক স্বত্ববান দখল বিদ্যমানকারীররগন থাকা অবস্থায় এজমালীতে ও ভোগ দখল করিতে থাকা অবস্থায়ভোগ দখলের সুবিধার জন্য  ঘরোয়া আপোষ বিভাগ বন্টন খাতে নিম্ন তফসিল বর্ণিত সম্পত্তি সহ অন্যান্য সম্পত্তিতে বা নির্দিষ্ট চিহ্নিত পৃথক ছাহাম প্রাপ্তে নিঃস্বত্ব খাস দখল যুক্তে মালিক স্বত্ববান দখলকার বিদ্যমান আছি|”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The recital of the said deed shows that Omar Ali got the land of suit plot alone by amicable partition among the four brothers and accordingly R. S. record was prepared in the name of Omar Ali and his 03 brothers by mentioning the name of Omar Ali as owner and possessor for the land of suit plot alone and also mentioning the names of his other brothers for land of other plots of the R.S. Khatian for the convention of possession of Omar Ali and his 03 brothers. The said R.S. record of right along with the said deed dated 26.10.1978 were not challenged or denied in any point of time neither by the brothers of Omar Ali nor even any heirs of his brothers and the possession of Omar Ali over the land of suit plot was admitted in the said deed by Omar Ali. Thereafter the said Meherunnessa sold out the said land to Fuljan Bibi who sold it to Nurjahan Begum and thereafter the plaintiffs got the said land through 08 deeds from Nurjahan Begumon 17.7.85 which well proved by the plaintiffs by proving their deeds as exhibit 5 series.  Plaintiffs categorically stated in his plaint that there took place an amicable partition amongst the brothers of Omar Ali and in pursuance of amicable partition Omar Ali got the land of suit plot along with other land. P.W. 1 was examined on behalf of the plaintiffs in where he categorically stated in support of the plaint that amicable partitions took place among Omar Ali and his brothers and Omar Ali got the land of suit plot alone who used to possess the same. Then transferred the same in favour of Meherunnessa and subsequently to the plaintiffs by the subsequent executants on 17.07.1985 through 08 registered deed exhibits 05 series and  P. W. 2 one of tenants under the plaintiffs admitted the possession of the predecessor as well as the plaintiffs and they proved the mutation Khatian as well as rent receipts for payment of rent for the suit land.<br/><br/>It further appears that the defendant No. 13 claimed the 38 decimals of land out of suit land by a registered exchange deed dated 08.11.2001 exhibit ‘Ja’ and he was examined as D. W. 1 who stated that he got 38¼ decimals of land from suit plot through a registered deed of exchange on 08.11.2001 but how he obtained his possession did not mention. Even he did not denied the R.S. Record of right in the name of Omar Ali.<br/><br/>On perusal of the said exhibit ‘Ja’ it appears that the C.S. recorded tenants namely Kobbat Ali and others who executed and registered deed in favour of Omar Ali and his 03 brothers dated 09.04.1941 and S. A. including R. S. records of rights are admitted but claimed that the heirs of Taleb Ali and Muslim Mia along with Ibrahim Mia transferred 38½ decimals of land to one Laila Parveen through an exchange deed dated 22.11.1990  but did not say how the said executants had  obtained right to exchange the said 38 decimals of land while admitted the R.S. Records of right in the name of Omar Ali. Then said Laila Pervin transferred to the same to Md. Mozzam Hossain on 07.04.1991 and 21.09.1992 thereafter Mouzzam Hossain transferred 38½ decimals of land to Md. Mouzzam Hossain through an exchange deed on 08.11.2001.<br/><br/>D.W.1 Stated he used to possess 38  decimals of land from the suit plot without mentioning the manner of possession.<br/><br/>D. W. 2 Md. Inam Hossain son of late Ibrahim i. e. brothers son of Omar Ali was examined and stated that he know the C. S. plot N o. 5275 and also stated that his father and uncles exchanged 38¼ decimals of land with Laila Parveen form the C.S. plot subsequently alleged to transfer to one Mizanur Rahman and in his cross-examination he stated that Mojibur has four shops and Mizanur Rahman has none  and admitted about a  one or two storied building on the suit land and also admitting the possession of the plaintiffs over 13 decimals of land and he further stated that he used to live at Bhuighar which is another district and who did not know the R.S. plot i.e. P.W. 2 did not know the suit land even he did not deny the fact of amicable partition amongst the brothers of Omar Ali and he did not deny the R. S. record of right as in correct  Exhibit ‘Ta’ dated 26.10.1978 by Omar Ali mentioned that he got the suit land by amicable partition these material fact of possession by Omar Ali also reflect in R. S. Khatian and accordingly  the same fact of partition also disclosed in the recital of Kabala deed dated 26.10.1978 by Omar Ali R. S. Khatian is also admitted as correct by the executant of the deed of exchange dated 08.11.2001 and also by defendant appellants.<br/><br/>In view of the fact and discussion above we find that Omar Ali got 51 decimals of land of suit plot alone through amicable partition amongst his brothers before 1970 i.e. before R.S. operation and accordingly R.S. Record was prepared and since R.S. Record was acted upon the deed dated 26.10.1978 by Omar Ali and subsequent deeds in favour of plaintiffs well acted upon for the suit land. <br/><br/>In support of contention and submission of the learned Advocate for the respondent has cited the following decision. We have gone through the decision in the case of <strong>Dayal Chandra Mondal and others Vs. Assistant Custodian of Vested and Non-Resident Properties (L&amp;B) and Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Dhaka and others, reported in 50 DLR 186</strong> and also referred to another decision by the respondent in the case of <strong>Fatema Khatun Vs. Fazil Mia, reported in 6 BLC 241</strong> in where the principle has been laid down by this Court as under, <strong>“Section 144A A finally published record of rights revised under section 114A of the SAT Act has a presumption of correctness and that presumption continues till it is otherwise rebutted by reliable evidence.”</strong><br/><br/>We also find that since Omar Ali got 51 decimals of land which correctly recorded in plot which already sold out and the brothers of Omar Ali got their share from other plots of R.S. Khatian and which was not denied that is admitted by the brothers of Omar Ali in such circumstances neither the brothers of Omar Ali nor any heirs of his brothers had any right title and possession over any land of suit plot. Therefore the exchange deed dated 22.11.1990 by the brothers and heirs of brothers of Omar Ali  has passed no title over any of the land of suit plot in favour of Laila Begum so question of title by subsequent deed dated 8.11.2011 in favour of appellants does not arise.<br/><br/>In such view of the facts materials on records discussion made above and law we find that the plaintiffs well proved their right, title and possession over the land of 51 decimals of suit plot amicable and further proved that the exchange deed 8.11.2001 in favour of the defendant appellant  was not acted upon.<br/><br/>Since title and possession over the suit land was lying upon Omar Ali and subsequ-ently vest upon Meherunnessa and thereafter the title and possession has been vested upon the plaintiffs and in pursuance of their deeds dated 17.07.1985 accordingly the plaintiffs are entitled to get the relief as prayed for. Since no title and possession for the suit land has been passed in pursuance of the deed dated 08.11.2001as mentioned in ‘Kha’ schedule of the plaint infavour of the defendant appellants therefore the plaintiffs are also entitled to get the relief for declaration in respect of the said deed as prayed for. We have gone through the judgment and decree of the learned trial court who after considering all these material as well as legal aspect passed the impugned judgment which is very much legal and proper and there is nothing to interfere by this Court.<br/><br/>In the result, the appeal is dismissed and the judgment and decree dated 27.09.2007 (decree signed on 02.10.07) passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka is hereby affirmed. And the rule issued in of Civil Rule No. 697(F) of 2007 is hereby discharged.<br/><br/>The order of stay and the order of status-quo passed in Civil Rule No. 697(F) of 2007 at the time of issuance of the rule on 12.11.2007 is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court record alongwtih a copy of the judgment to the Court below at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Moazzam Husain, J:</u></em></strong><br/> <br/>This Rule was issued calling in question an order <em>vide</em> Memo No. সহাসবি/ইউপি-৩৪/৭০/ ০৭ (অংশ-২) /৫১০ dated 30.08.2012 issued by the Respondent No.1  under the signature of Respondent No.2 whereby this petitioner, a Union Parishad Chairman,  was placed under temporary suspension following a no-confidence motion  passed against him on the charge specially of corruption.<br/><br/>Facts, in brief, are that the petitioner is the Chairman, Borikandi Union Parishad, Nabinagar, Brahmonbaria, elected for a term from 2011 to 2015. He took over office as chairman following publication of the list of elected chairmen/members of Union Parishads in the official gazette on 19.06.2011. While he was functioning as such all the twelve members of the Union Parishad brought a no-confidence motion against him on allegations of gross misconduct including misapprop-riation of public fund by abuse of office.  The no-confidence motion was addressed to the local Upazila Nirbahi Officer, (hereinafter referred to as the “UNO”) as per law. The UNO having received the same by his Memo No. 182 dated 04.03.2012 appointed a one-member inquiry committee comprising of Upazilla Livestock Officer to inquire into the matter and submit report. The inquiry officer accordingly issued a notice (Annex-C) on 11.03.2012 along with a copy of the said no-confidence motion asking the petitioner to show cause within 22.03.2012. Having received the show-cause notice the petitioner submitted in writing a reply (Annex-D) on 22.03.2012 denying all the allegations made therein.<br/><br/>The inquiry officer, however, was not satisfied with the reply submitted by this petitioner<strong>. </strong>He addressed the Chairman another notice on 22.3.2012 (Annex-E) saying that the reply given by him was not satisfactory and asked him to be present at the venue of local-inquiry (mentioned therein) to be held on dates fixed with preparations to meet charges against him. The local inquiry was accordingly held on the dates fixed. On inquiry a number of allegations were found proved. Thereafter, a meeting of the Parishad was held on 16.5.2012 in which the no-confidence motion was put to vote. And all the twelve members of the Parishad voted in favour of the motion thus the motion was finally carried through against the petitioner by 12/1 votes.<br/><br/>The inquiry officer by his office Memo dated 23.5.2012 submitted the report to the Respondent No.4 (UNO) who in his turn forwarded the report to the Respondent No.3 (DC, Brahmonbaria).  The Deputy Commissioner, by his office Memo dated 05.7.2012 forwarded the report to the Respondent No.1 with his opinion that allegations of corruption and misconduct under section 34(kha) and (gha) were found proved against the chairman and he was removable from his office. The Government having received the papers connected with no-confidence motion issued the order placing the chairman under temporary suspension under the signature of a Deputy Secretary (LGRD) which is under challenge before us. <br/><br/>Mr. Idrisur Rahman, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioner submits that the Government has no authority to suspend the petitioner under section 34(4) of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act, 2009. He did not, however, explain how the Government is so powerless and how the petitioner would have been benefited by other orders that might be passed against him. He next submits that in issuing the impugned order of suspension the authority violated the principle of natural justice inasmuch as he was not allowed right to defense enough for the gravity of the allegations.  His final contention is that the impugned order is tainted with <em>mala fide</em> issued at the behest of quarters inimically disposed to the petitioner. We have closely examined the records. We find nothing therein which might be construed to mean that the petitioner has been deprived of his right to be heard. Rather the records show otherwise. Two show-cause notices were issued to the petitioner on two phases of inquiry and the petitioner, amongst other things, responded the queries by submitting written-reply. More so, he did  never raise objections to the inquiry process. So far as <em>mala fide</em> is concerned, it is not a case merely to be made but must of necessity be made out which is sadly lacking.<br/><br/>Here is a case in which a Chairman of a Union Parishad has been placed under temporary suspension by the Government following a no-confidence motion passed against him and he is still moving under the shadow of his office with his designation as ‘chairman under temporary suspension’.<br/><br/>Reverting back to law, it appears that section 34 and 39 of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act, 2009, provide for procedures to be followed for removal of chairman/members of Union Parishad through disciplinary proceedings and possible actions to be taken during and at the conclusion of the proceedings. <br/> <br/>Section 34 of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act, 2009 reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify;

Under this section provisions are laid providing removal through no-confidence motion passed by a certain number of Members in Parishad. Section 39 provides how to bring no-confidence motion on specific allegations; procedure of inquiry; motion put to vote in Parishad and finally forwarding the same to the government for approval, if passed by requisite number of votes. Law, however, empowers Government to accord or not to accord approval to the no-confidence motion sent to it.  Although section 39 does not say anything of the government’s power beyond approval or no-approval it is fairly deducible from the scheme of law contained in sections 34 and 39 that once approval is given to the no-confidence motion by the government the office of the outvoted chairman/member stands vacated. What is left thereafter for the government is to formally remove the concerned chairman/member from office by an order published in the official gazette.<br/><br/><u>In the scheme of sections 34 and 39 there is no scope for a chairman or member removed from office pursuant to proceedings under section 39 to seek relief in appeal. The appellate forum created under sub-section (7) of section 34, is exclusively meant for chairman/member against whom proceedings under section 34 is taken and is removed by order published in the official gazette as required under sub-section (5) of section 34.</u><br/><br/><u>Section 34(1) provides for power to place an indicted chairman/member under ‘temporary suspension’ during pendency of the proceedings, not after conclusion of proceedings. Suspension literally means- ‘the act of debarring for a time from a function or privilege’. It means temporary deprivation of one’s office or position. The suspended officer does not cease to be public servant; he is only prevented from discharging the duties of his office for the time being. A concluded proceeding logically and indeed is followed by a final order, ie, either order of discharge or any order awarding suitable punishment.</u><br/><br/><u>This was a case for the government either to approve or not to approve the no-confidence motion sent by the inquiry officer through the Deputy Commissioner and, if approved, to remove the chairman by an order published in official gazette. Nothing of the kind was done. The government instead, placed the chairman under temporary suspension which is plainly incompatible with the stage of the proceedings and is grossly perverse. </u><br/><br/>The impugned order of temporary suspension has left an otherwise decided matter totally undecided. The issue might have been settled once for all by way of approval or no-approval to the no-confidence motion.  But things were set to linger years together by an apparently wrong order passed for reasons yet not known.<br/><br/>Mr. Motahar Hossain, learned DAG, submits that the petitioner was removed from his office by vote of no-confidence on specific charges of corruption and the motion was passed by 12/1 votes that means by all the members of his Parishad. Such a chairman, he insisted, should not be re-instated in office on mere technical defect in the order.   Mr. Tufailur Rahman, learned Advocate, appearing for added Respondent No.6, found it difficult to defend the order of temporary suspension in the peculiar facts but adopted the argument of the DAG that it is in the public interest that the petitioner should not be restored to office.<br/><br/>The allegations are grave. But the   gravity of offence cannot justify an order not only defiant of law but also deterrent to progress of democratic practices sought to be established by the legislature. The order of temporary suspensions passed where it is plainly unwarranted by law whereas not explicable upon any proposition of innocence smacks of malice. The order, in the sense, is vitiated by malice in law.  It seems to us to be an eminently fit case where interference is called for.<br/><br/><strong>To sum up:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Sections 34 and 39 of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act, 2009, provide for two separate but parallel procedures for removal of chairman or member(s) of the Union Parishad. Either of the proceedings may be resorted to for the purpose.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Since Parshad is a democratic institution ordinarily no-confidence proceedings should get preference over ordinary disciplinary proceedings so that democratic values can take roots at all levels of the society.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Although the office of the indicted chairman/member stands vacated with approval given by the government to the no-confidence motion the vacancy should be given formal shape by an order of removal published in official gazette. This will, however, not entitle the chairman/member removed under section 39 to the right of appeal provided under sub-section (7) of section 34.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The chairman/member against whom no-confidence proceedings is initiated as per section 39 cannot be deprived of his/her right to vote on ‘no-confidence motion’. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">For what we have stated hereinabove, we find merit in this rule. At the same time, we do not think that relief can be given absolutely in terms of the rule without frustrating the result of otherwise valid proceedings. Fitness of things, therefore, requires that the impugned order of temporary suspension be declared void and the case be sent back to Respondent No.1 with necessary directions to cure the defects.<br/><br/>In the result, the impugned Memo of temporary suspension is declared void and ineffective and the Respondent No.1 is directed to pass appropriate orders as required by section 39(13) of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act, 2009, on the no-confidence motion received by it and dispose of the matter in accordance with law within thirty days from date of receipt of this judgment. <br/><br/>This rule is thus disposed of with the aforesaid direction. No order as to cost.<br/><br/>Order of stay granted earlier is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>        Communicate copies of this judgment at once.<br/><br/><strong>        Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

This conduct of BCIC amounts to waiver of their right to attend the Board meeting, inspite of receiving the notice for the same and this should not be a bar for holding the Board meeting nor such conduct or unfair practice can be allowed in the rest of the company, to avoid a dead lock situation and this is a fit case where section 85(3) should be applied to overcome the dead lock situation.</strong><br/><strong>Besides that section 108(f) will have overriding</strong><strong> effect upon any provisions of the Article of Association. Hence, if BCIC nominee directors absent themselves from the Board meeting, after receiving the notices of the same, then the provisions of section 108(f) of the Act shall be applicable and the office of the nominee directors of BCIC shall remain to be vacated. This provision of statute shall prevail over the provisions of the Article 109.</strong><br/><strong>The Act does not lay down any manner as to how a Board meeting is to be conducted, although sub-section (I) of sections 85 and 87 lays down procedure for holding AGM, and EGM. So impracticability has arisen, in this case, for deliberate decision of BCIC to remain absent and thereby to present formation of quorum per Article 109. This conduct of the BCIC is contrary to the interest of the company and is intended to create a dead lock situation. There is no materials, except absurdity, in the submission that Sub-section (3) of Section 85 applies only to Annual General  Meeting.</strong><br/><strong>The learned Advocate for the respondents has, however, frankly conceded that the Board meeting must be held and there can not be any question about it.</strong><br/><strong>Accordingly, a direction was given that the Chairman (or the company secretary, if so ordered) should call the Board meeting upon servicing on all the directors as required under the provision of section 95 of the Act, informing the date, time, venue and agenda of Board meeting and transact the business in such meeting whether any of the nominees directors of B- Group share holders is present or not, provided that at least 5 directors should be present  to such meeting. If BCIC decides to waive their right to attend the Board meeting, which they can always waive, that will not, however, prevent formation of quorum and the Board can transact business as per the agenda noted in the notice. Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 109 of the Article of Association of the company, the board meeting to be called, held and conducted as per this judgement and order shall be binding on all concerned, including the company (MPML) and its share holders/ directors as well as on all dealing with the company and all such meeting shall be deemed to be meeting duly called, held and conducted. . . .

The respondent No. 1which is a public limited company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913. The respondent No. 2 is Registrar of Joint Companies &amp; Firms. The respondent No. 3 is Chairman and Director of the respondent No. 1 company. The respondent No. 4 is nominated director of Sonali Bank Ltd., a shareholder of the respondent No. 1 company, in the respondent No. 1 company. The respondent Nos. 5 and 6 are nominated directors of Magura Group Ltd. in the respondent No. 1 company. The respondent Nos. 7, 8 and 9 are nominated directors of Bangladesh Development Group Ltd. in the board of respondent No. 1 company. The respondent No. 10 is independent director in the respondent No. 1 company. The respondent No. 11 is Managing Director of the respondent No. 1 company. The respondent Nos. 12, 13 and 14 are nominated directors of Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), a shareholder of respondent No. 1, in the board of the respondent No. 1 company. The respondent No. 15 is BCIC; that the petitioner and the respondent Nos. 3 and one Miah Md. Rezoul Hoque in capacity of being shareholder of the respondent No. 1 company earlier filed Company Matter No. 284 of 2011 before Hon'ble High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh under section 43 of the Companies Act, 1994 for rectification of share register against another shareholders namely BCIC. The Hon'ble High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh vide judgment dated 19.02.2013 allowed the said application for rectification in Company Matter No. 284 of 2011 and directed to rectify the share register book and submit Schedule-X as per judgment dated 19.02.2013. Copy of the certified copy of the said judgment dated 19.02.2013; that thereafter BCIC filed appeal being Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 609 of 2013 before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on 14.03.2013 against the said judgment dated 19.02.2013; that thereafter the respondent No. 1 company rectified share register book and submitted Schedule-X on 24.03.2013 pursuant to the said judgment dated 19.02.2013 in accordance with decision of Board of Directors dated 14.03.2013. In the said Board Meeting dated 14.03.2013, the nominated directors of BCIC were also present. Copy of the said board resolution dated 14.03.2013, copy of the share register book as rectified and Schedule-X dated 24.03.2013 are annexed herewith; that thereafter the Judge-in-Chamber of the Hon'ble Appellate Division in the said C.P. No. 609 of 2013 vide order dated 04.04.2013 directed the parties to maintain status quo regarding share structure of the respondent No. 1 company as of 04.04.2013 till 6<sup>th</sup> October 2013, on which date the leave petition is fixed for hearing. Copy of the said order dated 04.04.2013 is annexed hereto; that the secretary of the respondent No. 1 company vide notice dated 18.08.2013 issued a notice for 143<sup>rd</sup> board meeting to be held on 31.08.2013; that the said notice of board meeting dated 31.08.2013 was duly served upon the nominated directors of BCIC namely respondent Nos. 12, 13 and 14; that under Article 109 of the Articles of Association of the respondent No. 1 company, the quorum of the board meeting constitutes with five directors including one director from each group. Under Article 2 of the Articles of Association of the respondent No. 1 company BCIC constitute Group-B. Therefore, in absence of any director of BCIC, the no quorum is constituted for holding board meeting; that BCIC having failed to succeed in any litigation, started to jeopardize the business of the respondent No. 1 company by way of preventing to constitute the quorum in the board meeting by remaining absent in the board meeting. BCIC took a opinion dated 26.08.2013 from one Mohammad Ashrafuddin Bhuiyan, Advocate, Supreme Court of Bangladesh, vide which opinion the said Mr. Bhuiyan advised BCIC to remain absent from board meeting so that no quorum is constituted. Pursuant to the said opinion dated 26.08.2013 BCIC vide letter dated 29.08.2013 requested the Chairman of the respondent No. 1 company, i.e., the respondent No. 3 to cancel the 143<sup>rd</sup> meeting to be held on 31.08.2013. Copy of the said opinion dated 26.08.2013 and letter dated 29.08.2013 are annexed herewith; that in such situation stated above, the directors present on 31.08.2013 were compelled to cancel the board meeting vide decision dated 31.08.2013. Copy of the attendance sheet and the minutes dated 31.08.2013 are annexed herewith; that due to arbitrary and whimsical decision of BCIC, the nominated directors of BCIC are abstaining to attend board meeting on purpose so that no quorum of board meeting is constituted. In such situation it has become impracticable for the respondent No. 1 company to hold and conduct board meeting. But under section 96 of the Companies Act, 1994 there is a compulsion upon the respondent No. 1 company to hold at least one board meeting in every three months and at least four board meeting in every year. Further, without board meeting, it is virtually impossible to run business of the company. As such holding and conducting board meeting in accordance with Article 109 of the Articles of Association of the respondent No. 1 company being impracticable, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to direct the company under section 85(3) of the Companies Act, 1994 read with Rule 8 of the Companies Rule, 2009 to hold the board meeting of the respondent No. 1 company without requiring presence of one director from each group compulsorily to constitute quorum of board meeting and in these facts and circumstances the petitioner has prayed for the reliefs as mentioned in the petition.<br/><br/>The respondent Nos. 12, 13 and 14 and 5 have filed an affidavit-in-opposition denying the materials allegations. However, it has further been stated in paragraph Nos.7 and 8 of the affidavit-in-opposition that the statements made in paragraph Nos.07 to 11 of the application are partly matter of facts and partly matter of records, but its not true that the Advocate, Mr. Bhuiyan advised BCIC to remain absent form the Board Meeting. Actually, Mr. Bhuiyan advised if the situation is treacherous, BCIC may not attend the same. In respect of matter of facts, the burden of proving the facts exclusively lies upon the petitioner and in respect of matter of records; the respondent No.15 refrains from making any comment; that with regard to the statements made in paragraph No.12 of  application, it is submitted that there were 08 (Eight) directors of the Magura Paper Mills Limited, among 08(Eight), 03 (Three) from BCIC, 01 (One) from Sonali Bank Limited and rest  04(four)  private sponsors. The Chairman of the Magura Paper Mills Limited is from the private sponsors. In the above stated circumstances, the Chairman of the Magura Paper Mills Limited, by using his casting vote usually takes all the decisions which are always against the interest of the BCIC and as such it doesn’t make any different sense weather the directors on behalf of the BCIC and Sonali Bank Limited attend the Board Meeting of the Magura Paper Mills Limited or not. For the reason that there is no protection of the interest of the minority which is guaranteed under the companies. Moreover, 03 (Three) representatives of the BCIC were engaged the said Magura Paper Mills Limited, but they were bound to leave the said mill due to threat to their life and also lodged a General Diary being No. 659 dated 12.09.2013.<br/>The learned Advocate Ahsanul Karim, appearing alongwith the learned Advocates Mr.Khairul Alam Choudhury and  Mr. Shamim Ahmed Mehedi, having placed the petition and referring to the documents annexed therewith submits that, as per Article 109 of the Articles of Association  (Annexure-K), for the purpose of forming the quorum presence of 5 Directors including 1(one) Director from each Group is required to dispatch or transaction any business in the Board meeting of the company. He next, referring to Article 2 of the Articles of the Association (AOA), submits that Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) is a GROUP-B share holder. The learned Advocate, thereafter, referring to a notice under reference No. MPM/CS-002/143/13 dated 18.8.2013 (Annexure-E), submits that 143<sup>rd</sup> Meeting of the Board of Directors fixing 31.8.2013, was issued by the company and copy of the said notice was issued upon the nominee directors of the BCIC i.e. the officials, representing the BCIC. He next, referring to a letter number 36.091.000.02.12.0312.2013/ 1438 dated 29.8.2013 (Annexure-F1) of BCIC, addressed  to the Chairman Magura Paper Mills, submits that, BCIC has requested the Chairman to cancel the 143<sup>rd</sup> Board Meeting stating that they have solicited opinion from the legal advisor of the BCIC (enclosed photocopy) and their legal advisor has advised  them not to attend the 143red Board Meeting. The said opinion was given by their legal advisor upon a query made by the BCIC as to whether BCIC should attend the Board meeting. Then, referring to legal opinion under reference AUA/ASH/2013 dated 26.8.2013 (Annexure-F), the learned Advocate submits that in this letter the legal advisor of the BCIC has opined that  the Board Meeting (of MPML) cannot be  held without presence at BCIC as per Article 109 of the Articles of Association, that requires presence of al least one  Director from each Group to form a quorum and it has been further opined that to attend the meeting in the circumstance will go against the interest of the BCIC. As such, the Directors of the BCIC may not attend the Board meeting as because without their presence the quorum of the Board meeting shall not be formed. The learned Advocate submits that this opinion expressed in that letter dated 28.8.2013 and the request for cancellation of the Board meeting made by BCIC in their letter dated 29.8.2013, is contrary the provisions of law as well as  prejudicial to the interest of the company inasmuch as the company is under legal duty to hold at least 4(four) Board meetings as per provisions of Section 96 of the Act and the company has served notice upon all the Directors as required by section 95 of the Act. Besides, this willful act to prevent formation of quorum in holding board meeting by remaining absent, inspite of receiving notice of the meeting, and the request made on the part of the BCIC  to cancel  the 143<sup>rd</sup> Board meeting has made it impracticable to call and conduct the Board meeting as per Article 109 of the Articles of Association of the company.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate further submits that the management and control of the affairs of the company is done by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director-perform his functions subject to the control and supervision of the Board of Directors. Now, unless the Board of Directors cannot act, by holding meetings, for want of quorum then a dead lock situated will arise that they may lead to the winding up of the company, which BCIC wants. He next submits that, in this circumsta-nces and owing to the willful refusal of the BCIC to attend the Board meeting, inspite of receiving the notice, and thereby preventing the formation of quorum as per Article 109, it has become it practicable to call  and conduct the Board meetings of the company as per Article 109 of the Articles of Association and in the result it will seriously affect interest of the company inasmuch as the company will not be able to take any move requiring the Board approval or Board  decision, nor it will be able to transact its business or to operate its’ Bank Account  or to approve payment of government dues and other authorities or to enter into any transaction or dealing by the company. Hence he has prayed for an order, as per provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 85 of the Act read with the Rule 8 of the Companies Rules, to enable the Board of Directors to call and conduct the Board Meetings of the company in the absence of the BCIC, if they remains absent even after receiving notice of the Board meeting. The learned Advocate further submits that, Article 109 provides for presence of at least one Director of each Group in the interest of the share holder of each group and any  director representing any group of share-holder can waive their right not to attend the Board Meeting, inspite of receiving the notice inasmuch as this provisions has been made for securing  individual interest of the each group of the share holders and such right and interest can be waived by the shareholder or the Directors of Group-B. Besides, this is not a statutory provisions that the presence of Director of each group is required to form the quorum. He also submits that the petitioner and others filed Company Matter No. 284 of 2011, under section 43 of the Act, in which judgment was passed, on 19.02.2013, allowing the petition. Against that, BCIC has filed CPLA No. 609 of 2013, but the Honorable Judge in Chamber did not allow that prayer to stay operation of the said judgment dated 19.2.2013. Inspite of knowing that the apex court is seisin of the matter, the BCIC, through the same lawyer, has moved another petition under section 43, regarding the self same subject matter, before the last Vacation Bench, but the learned Advocate for the petitioner having learnt  about filing of this petition opposed admission of the same and the Vacation Bench was pleased to let the matter go out of the list for mentioning  before the regular Bench. But the BCIC, being aware of their unfair conduct amounting to contempt of court, restrained from filing the application before the regular Bench even after reopening of  the court on 15.9.2013 and the said petition was rejected inlimine, since Appellate Division is in seisin of the self same matter. He submits that such conduct on the part of the BCIC amounts to utter disrespect to the apex court. The learned lawyer finally submits that, as per section 108 (f) of the Act read with the Articles of Association, the office of directors represe-nting of the BCIC is liable to be vacated for their absence in the Board meeting and the provision of section 108(f) with prevail over the provision of Article 109. He also submits that the company (MPPL) is not an enterprise of the BCIC. It is a public company limited by shares in which the BCIC is one of the share holders and the company is to be run and managed  by it’s Board of Directors without any external interference. BCIC officials are resorting to multiplicity of proceedings without debiting or single taken from their own pocket.  Hence, for the survival of the company and to ensure  compliance of the statutory provisions of section 96 as well as to run and manage the day to day business of the company the relief prayed for in the petition may be allowed.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned  Counsel appearing along with the learned Advocate Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Uddin Bhuiyn, appearing for the respondent No.12, 13, 14 and 15 on the  other hand, having placed the affidavit-in-opposition, firstly submits that this application is not maintainable. He continues that sub-section (3) of section 85 applies only relating to Annual General Meeting (AGM) of a company. It has no manner of the application  in the matter of a Board meeting. He next refers to sections 90-110 of the Act and submits that, function of the Board of Directors is quite different from that of AGM and for that reason as well sub-section (3) of section 85 is not applicable in this case. He next submits that this application itself is not bonafide. The purpose of this application is to transact business of the company by ousting the BCIC from the Board Meeting. Thereafter, referring to the prayer portion of the application, the learned counsel submits that even the relief prayed for in the substantive petition is beyond the scope of sub-section (3) of Section 85 of the Act. He finally submits that there are litigations pending before the Appellate Division and other courts between the parties and many things are yet to be finally resolved. At this stage, when asked from the Bench as to whether the learned Advocate suggests that Board meetings of the company should not be called and conducted till decisions have been arrived in the pending litigations between the parties,  the learned counsel has replied that Board meetings should be held. No one is against holding of the Board meeting of the company, but the agenda should be setforth in a manner that will serve best interest of the company and not of any particular group of shareholders. With these submissions the learned Advocate prays that this petition is liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned Advocates for the petitioner and of the respondents, perused the substantive application alongwith supplem-entary affidavit as well as the affidavit-in-opposition and the documents annexed with them.<br/>Having examined the Articles of Association of the company (Annexure-K to the supplementary affidavit), I find that the BCIC is GROUP-B share-holder. Then having examined the provisions of Article 109, I find that Article 109,  reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“ 109.The Directors may meet together for the dispatch of business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings and proceedings, as they may think fit, and the quorum necessary for the transaction of business will be five Directors including one Director from each group.”(underlining is mine)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>As such it is apparent that Article 109 required attendance of 5 Directors to form a quorum in order to transact the  meeting of the Board of Directors, whereas Article 72, on the contrary, required that  presence 5 members personally  present shall form quorum for holding the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and participation from each group has not been required. Then having perused the record, I find a  notice dated 4.8.2013 (Annexure-E) issued on 18.8.2013, by the company secretary calling 143<sup>rd</sup> Board meeting, fixing, 31.8.2013 and that the notice contains 6 agendum (including miscellaneous agenda) and that the said meeting was issued upon all Directors including the nominee directors representing  BCIC.

The said opinion reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“Mrs. Bithi Ahmed<br/>Manager Legal Arrears Department<br/>Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation<br/>B.C.I.C Bhaban<br/>30-31, Dilkhusha C/A<br/>Dhaka.”<br/>This is in reference to the above subject. Upon perusal of the available papers/ documents, if appears to us that the 143<sup>rd</sup> Board Meeting of Magura Paper Mills Limited (the company) is schedule to be held on 31.08.2013. One of the agenda of the Board Meeting is to discuss about the illegal/arbitrary activities of the BCIC so far done.<br/>Under the prevailing circumstances, Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (the BCIC) has solicited our legal opinion to the effect that whether the Directors on behalf of the BCIC including Directors of the Private Sector will attend the said Board Meeting or not.<br/>From our understanding, we would like to inform you that according to Article 109 of the Articles of Association of the Company, for a valid Board Meeting to be held the quorum necessary for the same is minimum five Directors including one Director from each group. Moreover, we have also come to know that the present situation in the company is hostile and they have already taken few arbitrary actions which go against the interest of the BCIC. Under the prevailing circumstances to attend the Board Meeting by the Directors of the BCIC appears to be treacherous. <u>As such the Directors of the BCIC may not attend the Board Meeting as because without their presence the quorum of the Board Meeting shall not be formed.</u><br/>Further, BCIC may send a letter to the company stating that because lack of security and few arbitrary actions already taken by them the BCIC is unable to attend the Board Meeting.<br/>For further query, if any please feel free to contract the undersigned.<br/>Thanking you.<br/>Yours faithfully,<br/>Mohammad Ashraf Uddin Bhuiyan<br/>Barrister-at Law<br/>For: ASHRAF UDDIN &amp; ASSOCIATES”<br/>(emphasis added).<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Finally I have examined at the minutes of 143<sup>rd</sup> Board meeting dated 30.8.2013 (Annexure-G(1) and find that, it has been recorded in the minutes that since the 3 Directors nominated by the BCIC was not present so the said meeting was cancelled for want of quorum and the agendum mentioned in the notice dated 26.8.2013(Annexure-F) could not transacted.<br/> <br/>As such, from the conduct of the BCIC as well as the facts and circumstances recorded herein above, I find that the petitioner has been able to make out a clear case that it has become impracticable to hold the Board meeting of the company owing to deliberate absence of BCIC nominee directors, inspite of receiving the aforesaid notice calling 143rd Board meeting, as required to be served upon them as per section 95 of the Act.<br/> <br/>I have also taken notice of the unprecedented request dated 29.8.2013 (Annexure-F1) of the BCIC to cancel the Board meeting. There is no provisions either in the Articles of the Association or in the Act to make any such request and apparently such request was made taking unfair advantage of the provisions of Article 109 that requires presence of at least one Director from each group, in order to form a quorum. I also find that the BCIC did not make the request to cancel  the board meeting in the interest of the company, but upon a legal opinion dated 26.8.2013(Annexure-F) and their conduct was not to protect the interest of the company. This fact also transpires that BCIC remained absent in 143<sup>rd</sup> Board meeting without leave.<br/> <br/>My findings recorded hereinbefore, show that notice dated 18.8.2013 of the 143<sup>rd</sup> board meeting fixing specific time, date and venue of the meeting and deliberately abstained from attending the meeting, without leave of absence and containing specific agendum has been issued upon al  directors including the nominee directors of BCIC. BCIC in their letter dated 29.8.2013 (Annexure-F(1) has acknowledged to have received the said notice dated 18.8.2013 (Annexure-E), served upon BCIC as required under section 95 of the Act. As such the company has complied with all formalities in calling its 143<sup>rd</sup> Board meeting, but could not conduct the same, in the manner as provided in Article 109, because BCIC has requested to cancel the meeting, in their own interest, vide their letter dated 29.8.2013 [(Annexure-F (1)]. These facts clearly nullify and disprove the claim of the learned counsel Mr. Mahbubey Alam, appearing for BCIC, that the purpose of the board Meeting was to oust BCIC from the company. Indeed no share-holder can oust another, in any circumstances, from the company, nor there is any provision within four corner of the Act laying down any mechanism to oust any share holder by another. So, this contention advanced on behalf of the Respondents (BCIC) is misconceived and has no legs to stand. Rather, the facts and circumstances, recorded hereinabove, have clearly established the circumstances that the conduct of the Respondents No. 12, 13, 14 and 15 (BCIC) has rendered it impracticable to conduct the Board meeting of the company (MPML) in the manner laid down in Article 109 of the Articles of Association owing to the BCIC deliberately deciding not to attend the Board meeting of the company in their own interest. The provisions for attendance of at least one Director from each group has been,  in my considered view (based on authority), kept in the interest of each group of share holders and such right can always be waived by any group, viz BCIC in this case. This conduct on the part of the BCIC  amounts to waiver of their  right to attend the Board Meeting, inspite of receiving the notice for the same and this should not bar holding the board meeting, nor such conduct or unfair practice can be allowed in the rest of the company, to avoid a dead-lock situation, and this is a fit case were sub-section(3) of section 85 should be applied to overcome the dead lock situation.<br/> <br/>Besides, section 108(f) will have overriding effect upon any provisions of the Article of Association Article 108(f) reads as follows: “he absents himself from three consecutive meeting of the directors or from all meetings of the directors for a continuous period of three months, whichever is the longer, without leave of absence from the Board of Directors.”<br/>        Hence, if BCIC nominee directors absent themselves from the Board meeting,  after receiving the notices of the same, then the provisions of clause-(f) of Section 108 of the Act shall be applicable and the office of the nominee directors of BCIC shall remain liable to be vacated.  This provisions of statute shall prevail over the provisions of Article 109.<br/> <br/>Then turning to other submissions of the learned Counsel Mr. Mahbubey Alam, submitting that Sub-section (3) of Section 85 is not applicable in respect of the Board meetings of a accompany, I hold that such a submission is fallacious and misconceived. The title of section 85 is regarding “Provisions as to meeting and Votes”. This does not refer to the Annual General Meeting exclusively, nor section 85 excludes from its ambit the meeting of the Board of Directors. Sub-section-(1) of section 85 refers to the procedure to hold Annual General Meeting (AGM). Sub-section-(2) of section 85 lays down certain provisions under Clause-(a) to (f), when the Article of the Association of a company does not make provisions in respect of matters addressed by clause (a) to (f), whereas sub-section (3) contains remedial provisions, when  it becomes impracticable to call ‘<u>a meeting’</u> of a company in the manner in which meeting of that company may be called or conduct as prescribed by the Articles of Association or  this Act. It is pertinent to the quote sub-section (3) of section 85 that reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>        “(3) If for any reason it is impracticable to call a meeting of a company in any manner in which meeting of that company may be called or to conduct the meeting of the company in manner prescribed by the articles or this Act the court may either of its own motio or on the application of any director of the company or of any member of the company who would be entitled to vote at the meeting, order a meeting of the company to be called, held and conducted in such manner as the court thinks fit, and where any such order is given the court may give such ancillary or consequential directions as it thinks expedient and any meeting called, held and conducted in accordance with any such order shall for all purposes be demed to be a meeting of the company duly called, held and conducted.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The wording of sub-section (3) does not refer to the Annual General Meeting or to Board meeting. If refers to ‘a meeting’ of the company, which has become impracticable to be conducted in the manner as laid down in Articles of Association (in this case as laid down in Article 109) or this Act. The expression “a meeting’ is wide enough to cover an AGM, and EGM or a Board meeting, as the case be. Though, in the circumstances recorded above, it has become impracticable to hold board meetings of the company as per the Articles of Association (Article 109 in deed). The Act does not lay down any manner as to how a board meeting is to be conducted, although sub-section (1) of section 85 and 87 section lays down procedure for holding AGM and EGM. So, impracticability has arisen, in this case, for deliberate decision of BCIC to remain absent and thereby to present formation of quorum per Article 109. This conduct of the BCIC is contrary to the interest of the company and is intended to create a dead lock situation. I find no materials, except absurdity, in the submission that Sub-section (3) of Section 85 applies only to Annual General Meeting.<br/> <br/>I also do not find any substance in the submission of the learned Advocate for the respondent that section 90-110 prohibits giving a direction as per provisions of sub-section (3) of section 85. This is evident from the heading ‘<em>Directors’</em> covering sections 90-110. As such, apparently section 90-110 deals with directors, not with the proceeding of a meeting of the Board of Directors. The procedure for the meeting of the Board of Directors has not been kept in the Act, rather it is conventionally  laid down in the Articles of the Association or in schedule-I of Act, if there is nor Articles of Association. If such a meeting cannot be called in the manner as provided for in the Article of Association, then apparently sub-section (3) of section 85 shall be applicable. As clearly indicated by its provisions, sub-section (3) of section 85 can be resorted to seeking  appropriate relief in the case of impartibility in conducting ‘a meeting’ i.e. any meeting of the company, whether it is the AGM, EGM or a Board meeting.<br/> <br/>The last submission of the learned Advocate for the respondent that this application is not filed bonafide, has no substance in view of the documentary evidence like issuance of notice dated 18.8.2013 calling the 143<sup>rd</sup>  of the Board meeting Annexure-E), letter dated 29.8.13 [Annexure-F(1)] of the BCIC acknowledging receipt of the said notice of the Board meeting and the BCIC requesting to cancel the Board meeting as well as the legal opinion dated 26.8.13(Annexure-F) advising the BCIC not to attend the Board meeting so that the quorum can be formed and no transaction can be made  in this said Board meeting. Besides, the agendum in the aforesaid notice dated 18.8.2013 does not indicates anything that the said meeting was called to jeopardize interest of the any group of share holders. Rather the BCIC, admittedly, deliberately decided not to attend the said meeting to prevent formation of the quorum as per Article 109, on the assumption that their absence will protect their interest, as distinct from interest of the company. So in my considered view, the conduct of the BCIC is exfacie malafide.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for the respondents has, however, frankly conceded that the Board meeting must be held and there cannot be any question about it.<br/> <br/>Besides, in the case of Satish Chandra Bank vs. Dhaka Jute Mills Ltd.: PLD 1968 Dacca 610, the power of this court has been clearly articulated and the decision taken in that case is being followed, without any departure, since then. Besides, reliance on this decision has been placed by our apex court in the case reported in 32 BLD (AD)(2012) 115: Md. Mazakat Harun &amp; Ors vs. Export Import Bank of Bangladesh Ltd. As such, this court has wide power under Sub-section (3) of Section 85, which is similar to sub-section (3) of section 79 of the Act 1913, to pass appropriate order.<br/><br/>        In view of the deliberation recorded above I find merit in this application. In the result the application is allowed. Accordingly, I do hereby permit and direct, in exercise of the power vested in this court under section 85(3) read with Rule 8 of the Company Rules, 2009 that the Chairman (or the company secretary, if so ordered) should call  the Board meetings upon serving notices on  all the directors as required under provision of section 95 of the Act, informing the date, time, venue and agenda of Board meeting and transact the business in such meeting whether any of the nominees directors of B-Group  share holders is present or not, provided that at least 5 directors should be present to such a meeting. If BCIC decides to waive their right to attend the Board meeting, which they can always waive, that will not, however, prevent formation of the quorum and the Board can transact business as per the agenda noted in the notice. I further hold that, notwithstanding anything contained in Article 109 of the Articles of the Association of the company, the Board meeting to be called, held and conducted as per this judgment and order, shall be binding on all concerned, including the company (MPML) and its share-holders /directors as well as on all dealing with the company and all such meeting shall be deemed to be meeting duly called, held and conducted.<br/>       <br/>Besides, if the office of any directors becomes vacant as per provisions of section 108 (f) of the Companies Act, then the company shall take resolution and submit Form-XII accordingly, with the Registrar of Joint Stock of Companies &amp; Firms.<br/><br/>        In the facts and circumstances cost of this case cost should have ordered to be borne personally by the respondent officials. However, taking lenient view, it is ordered that the parties will bear their respective costs.<br/><br/>        The Chairman is directed to record in the minutes of each board meeting the fact as to who of the Directors is absent with leave and who is absent without leave in any board meeting of the company.<br/><br/>        Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies and Firms.<br/><br/>        <strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The total amount of loan sanctioned to the Sarkar Flour and Rice Mills Ltd. was Tk. 22.10 crore and the total amount of loan sanctioned to Zayeda Cold Storage Ltd. was Tk. 4.00 crore and in all those loan transactions petitioner No. 2 furnished personal guarantee along with other securities to secure the repayment of the loans. But because of  certain unavoidable circumstances both these companies failed to maintain their repayment schedules. In such situation, a Memorandum of Agreement dated 22.04.2007 was entered into between respondent Nos.4 and 5 and petitioner No.2 stood as the guarantor of the said loans. Under the terms and conditions of the said agreement, the outstanding liabilities of Sarkar Flour &amp; Rice Mills Ltd. were fixed at Tk. 11.07 crore and those of Zayeda Cold Storage Ltd. were fixed at Tk. 4.20 crore and respondent No.5 bank issued sanction letters dated 21.06.2007 on the basis of that memorandum of understanding. But petitioner No.2 detected that the installments mentioned in the said sanction letter included interest calculated on compounded basis and not on simple interest basis as agreed upon in the said memorandum of understanding. Consequently there was exchange of corresp-ondences between the petitioners and the representatives of respondent No.4 bank and finally it was understood by the parties that the loan liabilities of both the petitioner companies would be rescheduled upon down payment. Accordingly, respondent No.4 bank issued a letter dated 08.01.2008 to petitioner No. 2 asking him to make down payment of Tk. 7500000/- for rescheduling the loans of both the companies. Petitioner No.2 paid Tk. 7500000/- as down payment from which Tk. 5400000/- was credited to the loan accounts of Sarkar Flour &amp; Rice Mills Ltd. and Tk. 2400000/- credited to the loan account of Zayeda Cold Storage Ltd. and also submitted a proposal for rescheduling the liabilities of both the companies by his letter dated 13.02.2008. But respondent No.4 bank again by a letter dated 25.02.2008 requested petitioner No.2 for payment of further Tk. 6600000/- for rescheduling the loans of both the companies. Petitioner No.2 paid that amount also of which Tk. 3800000/- was credited to the loan account of Zayeda Cold Storage Ltd. Thus the total amount paid by petitioner No.2 exceeded 10% of the total liabilities of both the petitioners-companies. But notwithstanding the fact that petitioner No.2, on behalf of both the petitioners- companies paid required amount as down payment respondent No.4 failed to take any steps towards rescheduling the liabilities of the petitioners-companies. Rather without any prior notice or intimation to the petitioners, respondent No. 4 on 21.04.2008 caused publi-cation of newspaper notice for auction sale of the mortgaged properties of the petitioners for which the petitioners had to file Writ Petition Nos. 3464 and 3466 of 2008 and got orders of stay against that auction sale. Respondent No.4 bank also circulated a memo dated 28.04.2008 amongst all banks and financial institutions describing the petitioners as defaulting clients stating that their amounts have been classified. Respondent No.4 also informed that to the Credit Information Bureau. After that, respondent No.4 bank instituted Artha Rin Suit Nos. 2 and 7 of 2008 in the Artha Rin Adalat, Rajshahi against the petitioners for realization of outstanding loan in spite of the fact that the petitioners were entitled to get their liabilities rescheduled as per BRPD circular No.1 dated 13.01.2003.<br/><br/>The petitioners have submitted that BRPD circulation No.1 dated 13.01.2003 issued by the Bangladesh Bank has laid down some guidelines/directives which are required to be followed by all scheduled banks while considering applications for re-schedulement of loans. Clause 1.02(Ka) of this BRDP circular No.1 has provided that an application for rescheduling shall be considered by a bank upon payment by the borrower of either 15% of the overdue installments or 10% of the total liability, whichever is less. The down payments made by petitioner No.2 upon the request of respondent No.4 exceeds 10% of the total loan liabilities of both the borrower companies and thus according to the terms of BRDP circular No.1 of 2003, the petitioner companies are entitled to have their liabilities rescheduled. In the circumstances, petitioner No.2 caused service of notices demanding justice dated 28.05.2008 upon respondent Nos.1 and 4 asking for compliance with BRPD circular No.1 of 2003 and rescheduling of the liabilities but did not get any response. Section 45 of the Bank Companies Act, 1991 has conferred powers upon respondent No.1 to issue directives for the proper management of the bank companies and it is mandatory for the bank companies to comply with such directives. The BRPD circular No.1 dated 13.01.2003 contains such directives of Bangladesh Bank and it is mandatory for all he scheduled banks to comply with the directives of this BRPD circular No.1 of 2003. If any bank does not comply with these directives of BRDP circular No.1 of 2003 it is incumbent upon Bangladesh Bank to issue specific direction to that bank for compliance with the directives of this BRPD circular.<br/><br/>Respondent No.4 has acted in breach of the mandatory provisions of BRPD circular No.1 dated 13.01.2003 by failing to reschedule the liabilities of the petitioners- companies in spite of their making down payment of more than the required amount for re-schedulement. Therefore, the Bangladesh Bank is now duty bound to take such action as is necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the BRPD by respondent No.4 bank so that the liabilities of the petitioners-companies with the respondent No.4 bank are rescheduled.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the BRPD circular No.1 dated 13.01.2003 issued by the writ-respondent No.4, the writ-petitioners moved the High Court Division by filing Writ Petition Nos. 4334 and 4339 of 2008 and obtained Rules Nisi in both the writ-petitions.<br/><br/>Writ-respondent Nos. 4 contested both the Rules by filing affidavits-in-opposition controverting the material statements made there. Writ-respondent No.4 took the plea that BRPD circular No.1 of 2003 was directory and not mandatory in character. <br/><br/>The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing the parties discharged both the Rules by the impugned judgment and order dated 03.06.2010. <br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the writ-petitioners in both the writ-petitions have filed Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos. 2453 and 2454 of 2010 before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the leave-petitioners in both the civil petitions for leave to appeal, submits that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that the provisions of BRPD circular No.1 dated 13.01.2003 being directive issued by respondent No.1 are mandatory and are required to be followed by all scheduled banks including respondent No.4 bank under section 25 of the Bank Companies Act, 1991 and as such the impugned judgment should be set aside. He further submits that by not rescheduling the liabilities of the leave-petitioners despite the down payment of the required amount as requested, respondent No.4 has acted in violation of the provisions of BRPD circular No.1 dated 13.01.2003.<br/><br/>Mr. Ajmalul Hossain, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the respo-ndents in both the leave petitions, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the parties, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/><br/>The High Court Division came to a finding that the petitioners have failed to repay the loan of respondent No. 4, City Bank Ltd. in spite of getting re-schedulement and extension of validity period on several occasions. The High Court Division noted that the contesting respondent in its affidavit-in-opposition stated that considering the present financial condition, repayment record and management of the loanee companies and also the liabilities of the loanee companies with other financial institutions, the City Bank Ltd. took decision not to grant any more re-schedulement of the outstanding loans of this petitioners-companies. The High Court Division found that respondent No.4 has also stated that the petitioners-companies did not submit any proper application with Board Resolution for re-schedulement of outstanding loans.<br/><br/>Having considered the affidavit-in-opposition of respondent No.4, the High Court Division found that loan granting bank already instituted Artha Rin Suit against the loanee companies, the guarantor and others for realization of outstanding loan and that the petitioners could make proper prayer for settlement/compromise with the loan granting bank in those suits. The High Court Division took notice that the Artha Rin Adalat Ain,2003 has kept specific provisions for taking initiatives for settlement of dispute between the plaintiff /financial institution and the defendant, loanees, guarantors and others.<br/><br/>The findings arrived at and the decision made by the High Court Division having been made on proper appreciation of laws and facts do not call for interference. Accordingly, both the civil petitions for leave to appeal are dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>End.</strong></div></div></div>

In such a case the Court should reasonably infer that the story of recognition of the assailants was a subsequent embellishment.</em>... (88)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898) </strong><br/><strong>Section 161</strong><br/><strong>The occurrence took place on 02-09-2001. P.Ws. 3, 4 were examined by the I.O. on 15-12-2001 and 17-11-2001 respectively, both P.Ws. 6-7 were examined by the I.O. on 30-11-2001 and P.W. 11 was examined after 3/4 months  from the occurrence. So inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses cast a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration.... (90)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Criminal Trail</strong><br/><strong>In a criminal case it is significant that the prosecution must prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt particularly the place of occurrence. P.Ws. 2, 3, 4, 7, 11 categorically stated that the deceased Nurul Islam Bachchu was chased by the accused from Kalam’s house towards Abdul Rouf’s house, where he was shot dead. But P.W. 6 stated that he was chased from Jail road then to Kalam’s house, lastly to the Rouf’s house. It is the definite case of the prosecution according to P.W. 1 that he was chased from Muftibari to Hasanfoez Lane, then near to the house of Rouf. Therefore, on an assessment of the evidence of aforesaid alleged eye witnesses, we find that the presence of those witnesses at the place of occurrence or about the time is doubtful from their testimony that either P.W.6 or P.Ws. 2-4, 7, 11 or F.I.R. or the evidence of P.W. 1 be believed or that none of them be believed. On the face of these inconsistencies it is difficult to rely upon their testimony.... (92)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 3 and 8</strong><br/><strong>It is pertinent to point out that the learned Judge convicted one set of accused and acquitted other set over the selfsame of evidence on record. There is no mismatch or distinction between the acquitted accused and the convicts so far as the ocular testimony is concern. The eye witnesses having been disbelieved against one set of accused should not be believed against other set without any independent corroboration....

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This Death Reference under Section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been made by the learned Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi, for confirmation of death sentence of contemned-prisoners.<br/> <br/>By the above appeals the appellants have challenged the legality and propriety of the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 03-08-2005 passed by learned Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi, in Druto Bichar Tribunal Case no. 24 of 2005 convicting the appellants under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code and sentencing each of them to death by hanging. By the same judgment rest nine accused were acquitted from the charge. Against the order of acquittal of above seven accused-respondents government presented the above appeal.<br/> <br/>The Death Reference and all these appeals having arisen out of the common judgment. These have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/> <br/>The essence of the prosecution case unfurled at trial are that on 02-09-2001 at 8.45 a.m. while Nurul Islam Bachchu since deceased on the way to home from his shop reached near Muftibari, then the accused namely Hafizur Rahman alias Helal, Shafiqul Islam son of Sarowar Hossain, Kabil, Ramjan, Pannu, Abdul Khalek, Abdul Malek, Pikture alias Shahidul Islam, Asadul, Rabiul Islam alias Rabul, Shahjahan, Shafi son of Abdul Jalil, Hafijul, Hur Babu and Najmul being armed with short-gun, pipe-gun, Shutter-gun and Iron- rod suddenly emerged and chased him towards Hasan Foiz Lane wherein accused Helal ordered to fire then accused Ramjan opened fire beneath his knee causing injury and on screaming he rushed near the house of Advocate Abdur Rouf but accused Shafiq son of Sarowar, Kabil, Abdul Malek and Najmul caught hold of him, accused Helal, Abdul Malek, Asadul, Picture caught hold of his left hand while accused Rabiul and Shajahan right hand. Then accused Hur Babu, Kabil and Pannu opened fire to him by gun causing injuries at the chest and right hand respectively. Accused Malek and Shafi son of Abdul Jalil opened fire at his neck. The locals namely Nasidul Haq alias Kota (P.W.7), Ashraful Reja (P.W. 9), Manu Mia (P.W.10), Chunnu, (P.W. 12), Abdus Sattar(P.W.15) and others rushed to the spot and sensing their presence accused departed from there. The victim was taken to hospital by rickshaw in critical condition wherein the attending doctor declared him death. Having had heard the incident P.W.1 Md. Harunur Rashid brother of deceased rushed to the scene and learnt the occurrence from the witnesses. Reportedly the accused are local terrorists and drug traders. He and his brother since deceased used to resist the criminal acts of the accused before occurrence. So the accused being revengeful threatened them with dire consequence. The same was reported to local Police Station wherein G.D.E. no.35 dated 01-08-2001 was recorded. The reasons behind the murder might be the sequel to the conflict between them. Later on at 19.10 hours prosecution was launched by lodging a first information report by P.W.1 Harunur Rashid as informant which was recorded as Kushtia Sadar Police Station Case no. 04 dated 02-09-2001 corresponding to G.R. no.224 of 2001 under sections 147,148, 149, 302, 114 and 120-M of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>The Police after investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 114, 302, 34,120-M of the Penal Code accusing 16 accused including the condemned prisoners.<br/> <br/>Then, the accused were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 302, 34 and 302, 109 of the Penal Code to which the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.<br/> <br/>In course of trial the prosecution in all, produced 19 witnesses, of them examined 14 witnesses and 5 witnesses were tendered by the prosecution and defence declined to cross -examine them.<br/> <br/>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication. It is divulged in defence that the deceased had no known source of income and involved in dacoity and murder cases. So, he might be killed by unknown assailants but due to internal feud the accused were falsely implicated out of vengence by the rivals.<br/>After closure of the prosecution case the accused on dock were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure again they repeated their innocence but led no evidence in defence.<br/>After trial the learned Judge of the Court below convicted the accused as aforesaid.<br/> <br/>The learned Deputy Attorney General  appearing for the state supports the reference. He adds that in this case P.Ws. 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12 are the eye witnesses to the occurrence and they categorically corroborated the prosecution case as alleged by the informant. He adds that the first information report was lodged within a reasonable time and delay of 10 hours in lodging the first information report is not an inordinate delay. Moreso, the same was satisfactorily explained. In support of his contentions he refers the case of Golam Azam Vs. The State 6 MLR (AD)240 held:<br/> <br/><em>“When the occurrence took place at 5:30 P.M. and the brother of the deceased who was busy with the dead body in the Hospital during the night lodged F.I.R. in the next morning. The explanation of delay as given being satisfactory is not fatal for the prosecution. Similarly the delay in examining some witness by the Investigating officer does not cast any adverse reflection. The conviction and sentence being based on consistent evidence of the eye witnesses are held to have been perfectly justified warranting no interference.”</em><br/> <br/>He further submits that evidence of all, prosecution witnesses are corroborative with each other, and conviction and sentence can be based on the sole evidence of only one eye witness. In support of his contentions he refers the case of Milon alias Shahabuddin Ahmed Vs.  The State 53 DLR 464 held:<br/> <br/><em>“Non-examination of nearby people not fatal to the prosecution case when there are eye-witnesses of the occurrence.” </em><br/> <br/>He further refers the case of Khoka Vs. The State 5 BLC(AD) 86 held:<br/> <br/><em>“The Division Bench like the trial Court believed the only eye-witness. Believing only eye-witness is legally permissible and conviction can be based on the sole evidence of only one eye-witness.”</em><br/> <br/>The learned Counsel lastly submits that the order of conviction and sentence passed on evidence record which calls for no interference by this Court.<br/> <br/>In respect of Govt. Criminal appeal no.22 of 2005 the learned Deputy Attorney General submits that there are consistent evidence against the acquitted accused inasmuchas all the prosecution witnesses categorically stated that the accused Ramjan, Shafi, Malek, Habibur Rahman, Hafijur Rahman, Abdul Khalek and Hafijul along with other convicted accused chased the deceased and subsequently opened fire to him to death. The evidence against the acquitted accused and the convicted accused are identical. So the order of acquittal passed in favour of them cannot be sustained.<br/> <br/>The learned Counsels appearing for the condemned prisoners and the appellants by their common contentions seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on the sixth fold arguments:<br/> <br/><strong><u>Firstly</u></strong><br/> <br/>The occurrence took place on 02-09-2001 at 8.45 a.m. and soon-after the occurrence the informant Harunur Rashid brother of the deceased rushed to the scene, met with the witnesses and Police personnel, particularly his brother P.W. 4, Advocate Md.Giasuddin Miah but the F.I.R. was lodged after long lapse of 10 hours i.e. at 19.10 hours without any satisfactory explanation of delay which cast a serious doubt upon the prosecution story. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Abdul Latif alias Gudu and 6 others Vs. The State 44 DLR 492 held:<br/> <br/><em>“ FIR- delay-The Court has always viewed First Information Report with grave suspicion when there had been unexplained delay in lodging it. It can be presumed that the delay was used for manipulation of the prosecution story.”  </em><br/> <br/><strong><u>Secondly</u></strong><strong>          </strong><br/> <br/>The informant P.W. 1 Md. Harunur Rashid categorically stated in the first information report that he found Manu Mia(P.W.10), Md. Ashraful Reja( P.W. 9), Md. Chunnu Mia,(P.W. 12), Nasidul Haq Kata(P.W. 7), Abdus Sattar Rentu (P.W. 15),  were present at the place of occurrence from whom he heard the occurrence to the effect, that accused Habib opened fire to the deceased at the middle of his chest but in his evidence he as P.W.1 stated that Kabil committed such occurrence which is absolutely a departure from the prosecution case. Moreso, the witnesses namely P.Ws. 4, 6 and 11 who claimed as eye witnesses, not the FIR named witnesses. So their evidence cannot be relied for convicting the accused. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Nurul Islam and others Vs. The State 45 DLR 142 held:<br/> <br/><em>“Where FIR does not contain an important statement deposed to by the witnesses, it is clear that there has been subsequent embellishment of the prosecution case which makes it untrustworthy.”</em><br/> <br/>On identical point  they refer the case of State Vs. Azharul 3 BLC 382 held:<br/> <br/>“<em> The first Information Report is the foundation of the prosecution case and if the foundation is removed the whole prosecution case shall fall. It appears that subsequent deviation from the First Information Report story and the embellishment of the same by the eye-witnesses namely, PWs. 1-4 at the trial makes the credibility of the witnesses doubtful.</em><br/> <br/><em>It is now well settled that if important witnesses are examined by the I.O. long after the occurrence that diminishes the credibility of the evidence adduced by those witnesses at the trial. From that point of view the evidence of P.Ws. 2 to 4 lost their credibility as the I.O. started investigation of the case on 11-09-1991 but their statements were recorded under Section 161, Cr.P.C. on 01-12-1991.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of Gopal Rajgor and others Vs. State  9 BLD- 455 held:<br/> <br/><em>“ First Information Report – Effect of substantial departure from the FIR story- FIR can legitimately be used for assessment of the prosecution case- Any departure or deviation from the main story disclosed at the earliest recorded version may be looked upon with great suspicion.”</em><br/> <br/>In the Case of Mujaffar Ali and others Vs. The State PLD 1964(W.P) Lahore 32 held:<br/> <br/><em>“Witness- Names not  figuring in F.I.R. but</em><em> subsequently mentioned in supplementary statement-Testimony, held, suspicious and excluded from consideration.”</em><br/> <br/><strong><u>Thirdly</u></strong><br/> <br/>P.Ws 6 and 7 who claimed to be eye witnesses and soon-after the occurrence they happened at the spot but they were examined by the investigating officer after long lapse of three months i.e. on 30-11-2001 which diminishes the credibility of their evidence. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Bangladesh (State) Vs. Paran Chandra Baroi 1986 BCR (AD)225 held:<br/> <br/>“<em>The long delay in examining the material witnesses cast a doubt on the whole prosecution case.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of Vijaybhai Bhanabhai Patel Vs. Navnitbhai Nathubhai Patel and Ors. 2004 Criminal 413 Supreme Court of India held:-<br/> <br/><em>“ The delay in questioning the witnesses by investigating officer is a serious mistake on the part of the prosecution. So the witnesses are not reliable.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Al Hasib Bin Jamal alias Hasib and five others 59 DLR 653 held:<br/> <br/>“<em>Inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the pros-ecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration.”</em><br/> <br/><strong><u>Fourthly</u></strong><strong>          </strong><br/> <br/>There are serious contradictions of the statements of the witnesses to the Investigating Officer and testimony before the Court which makes their evidence unreliable. In support of their submissions they refer the case of Abul Kalam Azad alias Ripon (Md) Vs. State 58 DLR(AD) 26 held:<br/> <br/>“<em>When witness is contradicted by a statement recorded by the Police in the course of investigation the only effect that it can have is to reduce the evidentiary value of his testimony in Court and make the witness unreliable on the point on which he is so contradicted.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of The State vs. Azizur Rahman alias Habib 20 BLD-487 held:<br/><em>“ Omission of vital fact by the witnesses recorded by the investigating officer that he saw the condemned prisoner and his wife in the night of occurrence of going inside the hut and that they slept inside the hut in the night following the morning of which condemned prisoner’s wife was found dead is reliable.</em><br/><em>The witnesses having not stated at the earliest point of time the said evidence cannot be relied upon in Court.” </em><br/> <br/>In the case of Narain Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh 2004 Criminal 344 Supreme Court of India held:<br/>“<em> Conviction under-Informant was not reliable witness-Eye-witnesses had given varying versions- Genesis and place of incident not established by cogent and credible evidence by prosecution –Held-No reason to take different view only against the appellant of conviction –Therefore, his conviction also set aside.”</em><br/> <br/><strong><u>Fifthly</u></strong><br/> <br/>P.Ws. 2-4, 6, 7, 11 categorically stated that the occurrence took place from the house of Kalam towards the house of Advocate Abdur Rouf whereas P.W. 12 said that occurrence took place from Hasanfoez Lane towards the house of Advocate Abdur Rouf but the definite prosecution case according to P.W. 1 was that occurrence took place from Muftibari towards the house of Abdur Rouf, such different versions cast a doubt upon the place of occurrence aswellas manner of occurrence. In support of their contentions they refer the case of Moslemuddin Vs. Ahmed Ali alias Akku and ors.  7 BCR(AD) 85 held:<br/> <br/><em>“ On scrutiny of the first information report and the evidence of P.Ws. 1,2,3,4 and 6 it appears that there are discrep-ancies asto the place of occurrence as well as injuries. The contradictions and the discrepancies being highly serous, the appeal is dismissed”.</em><br/> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Azizul Haq 12 BLT 199 held:<br/> <br/>“<em> Place of occurrence- on an assessment of the evidence of these witnesses, we find that the presence of these witnesses at the place of occurrence at or about the time is doubtful from their testimony that either P.W.1 or P.W.2 or P.W. 6 or P.W.7 be believed or that none of them be believed. On the face of these inconsistencies it is difficult to rely upon their testimony.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of Gopal Rajgor and ors. Vs. State 42 DLR-446 held:<br/> <br/>“<em>Defence version- Manner of occurrence- prosecution having failed to prove their version of the manner of occurrence, the defence version became probable and the appellants were acquitted of the charges.”</em><br/> <br/><strong><u>Sixthly</u></strong><br/> <br/>The most important witnesses namely Kalam, Advocate Abdur Rouf, Shimul who rushed to the scene soon-after the occurrence and S.I. Lutfor Rahman who at the first instance held investigation and visited the place of occurrence, prepared sketch map and index were not examined by the prosecution and most interested witnesses were examined which makes the prosecution case unreliable.<br/>In support of their contentions they refer the case of Anaddi alias Ayenuddin and ors. Vs. State 6 BLC-311 held:<br/> <br/>“<em> Non- examination of relevant witnesses as mentioned in the first information report as well as independent witnesses, particularly some of neighbours, raises a presumption against the prosecution to the effect that had they been examined in the case they would not have supported the prosecution case and the benefit of this defect will go to the accused persons.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of Mati Miah Vs. State 44 DLR 554 held:<br/><em>“Interested witness- Conviction cannot be based on the uncorroborated testimony of the informant who is a police officer and is vitally interested in the result of the case.”</em><br/> <br/>The learned Counsels lastly submit that in view of the aforesaid principles enunciated in different decisions the prosecution measur-ably failed to prove the charge against the condemned prisoners. Therefore, the conviction and sentence awarded to them are not sustainable in the eye of law. So the same is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/>In order to appreciate their submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious considerations to their submissions.<br/> <br/>Now the question calls for consideration, is, whether the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence can be sustained in the eye of law.<br/> <br/>It is undisputed that the slain Nurul Islam Bachchu was lynched on 02-09-2001 at morning.<br/> <br/>Let us now weigh and sift the evidence on record as adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/>P.W. 1, Md.

He stated that S.I. Lutfor Rahman was already in service but his whereabout was unknown to him. He denied the suggestion that without proper investigation he submitted charge sheet and deposed falsely.<br/> <br/>These are all of the evidence on record adduced by the prosecution to prove the charge.<br/> <br/>At the very outset we should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.<br/> <br/>The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.<br/> <br/>The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.<br/> <br/>In maters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.<br/> <br/>There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.<br/> <br/>The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.<br/>Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/> <br/>Admittedly the informant (PW 1) is not the eye witness of the occurrence. He described the names of witnesses namely Manu Mia (P.W. 10), Md. Ashraful (P.W.9), Chunnu (P.W.12), Nasidul Haq Kota(P.W. 7) and Abdus Sattar (P.W. 15) in the first information report who allegedly witnessed the occurrence and he heard the manner of occurrence from them. In first information report he categorically stated that on 02-09-2001 at 8.45a.m. his brother slain Nurul Islam Bachchu while reached near the house of Muftibari, then the accused chased him towards Hasan Foez Lane and near the house of Advocate Abdur Rouf the murder took place. He also categorically narrated the specific allegations of the accused stating along with others that accused Habib opened fire to Bachchu by gun causing bleeding injuries at the middle of the chest but in his testimony before the Court as P.W.1 replaced the name of Habibur Rahman by accused Kabil.  The reasons for such major departure was not explained.<br/> <br/>It is pertinent to point out that out of five F.I.R.named witnesses, three witnesses namely P.W. 9, 10 and 15 were tendered by the prosecution and none of the witnesses came forward to corroborate the cause of such departure of facts of P.W. 1.<br/> <br/>In the case of State Vs. Basirullah 16 DLR-189 held:<br/> <br/>“<em> F.I.R. can legitimately be used for assessment of the whole prosecution case in the light of facts and circumstances of the case.</em><br/><em>It is true that a first information report cannot be used to contradict any witness other than the informant, but the Court can and should take notice of the earliest recorded statement with regard to the prosecution case in the context of the circumstances which make this particular report of vital impotance in the assessmernt of prosecution evidence.</em><br/><em>The Court is entitled to note the conflict between the first recorded version of the prosecution case and the story that is made out in course of the trial. A comparison between two such versions of the case is not only permissible, but impertative in the context of the circumstances set out above.”</em><br/> <br/>In the case of Nowser Molla and others Vs. The State 11 BLD 295 held:<br/> <br/>“<em> The F.I.R. as earliest recorded version of the prosecution case may be looked into for the purpose of comparing the same with the statement made subsequently during trial by the P.Ws. Any deviation or departure from F.I.R. story make the prosecution story doubtbul and casts serious doubt as to the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. Partial departure creats suspicion as to the truth of prosecution case and total departure from F.I.R. story sometimes warrant exclusion of the prosecution evidence from consideration.” </em><br/> <br/>Similar views were taken in the cases of Harun Sheik Vs. The State 8 BLD 425 and Mafiz Uddin Vs. The State 31 DLR 16.  In view of above decisions it is very unsafe to rely on the evidence of PW- 1.<br/>We find that prosecution in all produced 19 witnesses, of them examined 15 witnesses and rest 5 witnesses were tendered by the prosecution and defence declined to cross-examine them. P.W. 1 is the informant but not the eye witness, P.Ws. 2 and 3 are also not the eye witnesses but they heard some facts of occurrence from the eye witnesses. P.Ws. 4,6,7, 11,12 claimed themselves as the eye witnesses to the occurrence and they were examined to corroborate the prosecution case.<br/> <br/>P.W. 13 is a Physician who held autopsy upon the cadaver. P.W. 14 a constable who carried the dead-body to the morgue for autopsy. P.W. 17 recorded the G.D.E. no. 35 dated 01-08-2001 before the occurrence.  P.W. 18 held inquest and also prepared some seizure lists. P.W. 19 is the investigating officer who submitted charge sheet accusing 16 accused.<br/> <br/>Therefore, the prosecution case absolutely rest upon the testimony of P.Ws. 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12 the alleged eye witnesses to the occurrence.<br/> <br/>P.W.4, Md. Giasuddin Mia brother of the deceased andinformant. He is not F.I.R. named witness although he claimed himself that soon-after the occurrence he rushed to the scene and witnessed the occurrence but he stated to I.O.

It was proved by evidence that at the time of occurrence he was inside the bath room and some important facts were not disclosed to I.O. at the earliest opportunity. After close scrutiny of his evidence the Court below disbelieved it. We also hold the same view.<br/> <br/>P.W. 6 Md. Alal also claimed himself as an eye witness to the occurrence and narrated the specific allegations against the accused but he stated nothing that at the time of occurrence he rushed to the scene. In respct of his evidence P.W. 19 stated that he examined Alal (P.W. 6) on 30-11-2001 but he did not state to him that the accused cordoned the deceased Bachchu and taken to hospital.<br/> <br/>P.W. 7 Nasidul Haq Kota is an F.I.R. named witness and claimed himself as eye witness.

In respect of his evidence (P.W. 19) stated that he did not state to him that at 8.45 a.m. the accused chased deceased towards Hasanfoez Lane and the place of death of Bachchu; Pannu opened fire at the order of Helal.<br/> <br/>P.W. 12, Md. Chunnu Mia brother of the deceased Bachchu. He is an F.I.R. named witness. He claimed himself as an eye witness. He corroborated the occurrence with specific allegations of the accused.  In respect of his evidence I.O. (P.W.19) stated that he (P.W.12) did not state to him that Ramjan opened fire to Bachchu beneath the left knee; all the accused cordoned Bachchu near the house of Rouf, Pannu, Shafi, Malek, Hurbabu and Kabil successively opened fire to Bachchu.<br/>P.W 19 also stated that none of the witnesses stated to him that at the order of Helal, Pannu, Shafi, Malek, Hurbabu, Kabil opened fire to victim.<br/> <br/>After close scrutiny of their evidence we find that at the earliest point of time those witnesses did not disclose the material facts either to the Investigating Officer or to the locals which makes the prosecution case shaky.<em> It is well settled that when an eye witness to the occurrence that took place at the morning does not disclose the names of the assailants he allegedly recognized and other material facts to the witnesses who came to the scene immediately after the occurrence was over or at the earliest opportunity</em> <em>and there is no justifiable reason for nondiscloser of the material facts, belated discloser of material facts renders their evidence/ testimony doubtful. In such a case the Court should reasonably infer that the story of recognition of the assailants was a subsequent embellishment. With this regard reliance is being placed in the case of Asadur Rahman alias Asad vs. The State 15 DLR 290. Similar view was taken in the case of Abdur Rouf Moral and others Vs. The State 7 BLT 310. </em><br/><em>It is also well settled that when an eye witness witnessed the occurrence, accused person departed from the scene and many people assembled at the place of occurrence followed by officials. It is expected that the eye witnesses will name the accused persons not only to their own kith and kin but also to uninvolved persons, including high officials. Belated discloser of the names of the assailants make their evidence doubtful. With this regard reliance is being placed in the case of Nowabul Alam and others Vs. The State 15 BLD (AD) 55. </em>Therefore we hold that their belated discloser of material facts is vulnerable to the credibility and as such the same are incompatible as well as incredible<em>.</em><br/>Moreso, the occurrence took place on 02-09-2001. P.Ws. 3, 4 were examined by the I.O. on 15-12-2001 and 17-11-2001 respectively, both P.Ws. 6-7 were examined by the I.O. on 30-11-2001 and P.W. 11 was examined after 3/4 months  from the occurrence. So inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses cast a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration.<br/> <br/><em>In the case of Sanwar Hossain vs. State, 45 DLR - 489 it was held inordinate delay in examining the important prosecution witnesses casts a serious doubt as to the truth of the prosecution case and in the circumstances their evidence cannot be relied on and are to be left out of consideration. In the case of Bangladesh Vs. Paran Chandra Baroi, 1986 BCR(AD) 225 it was held that the long delay in examining the material witnesses casts a doubt on the whole prosecution case. In the case of Muslimuddin and others Vs. State, 38 DLR(AD)311 evidence of P.W.3 who claimed to have recognised the assailants was not relied upon as her statement, which could have been recorded on the day following the incident, was recorded after 34 days. Same view was taken in the cases of Haji Md. Jamal Uddin Hossian and others vs. State,1994 BLD-33, State Vs. Mokbul Hossain, 1986 BLD 34= 37 DLR 156, Nurul Haque Vs State, 1982 BCR 332, Moinullah and another Vs. State, 1988 BLD 100= 40 DLR 443 and State Vs. Babul Hossain, 52 DLR-400. In view of the above settled principle of law the evidence of P.Ws. 3, 4, 6, 7 and 11 should not be relied upon and the same are to be left out of consideration.</em><br/> <br/>In a criminal case it is significant that the prosecution must prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt particularly the place of occurrence. P.Ws. 2, 3, 4, 7, 11 categorically stated that the deceased Nurul Islam Bachchu was chased by the accused from Kalam’s house towards Abdul Rouf’s house, where he was shot dead. But P.W. 6 stated that he was chased from Jail road then to Kalam’s house, lastly to the Rouf’s house. It is the definite case of the prosecution according to P.W. 1 that he was chased from Muftibari to Hasanfoez Lane, then near to the house of Rouf. Therefore, on an assessment of the evidence of aforesaid alleged eye witnesses, we find that the presence of those witnesses at the place of occurrence or about the time is doubtful from their testimony that either P.W.6 or P.Ws. 2-4, 7, 11 or F.I.R. or the evidence of P.W. 1 be believed or that none of them be believed. On the face of these inconsistencies it is difficult to rely upon their testimony. It is pertinent to point out that S.I. Luthfor Rahman, first investigating officer who prepared sketch map (Exhbt. 16), index (Exbht. 18),  showing the place of occurrence alongwith surrounding building, grocery shop etc. are quite different from that of the sketch map (Exhbt.17) and index (Exhbt.19) prepared by subsequent I.O. P.W.19 but surprisingly S.I. Luthfor Rahman was withheld by the prosecution without any explanation. Moreover most vital witnesses namely Abdur Rouf, Kalam, Shimul were not examined by the prosecution. We also find from the evidence on record that Nurul Islam Bachchu was survived by his wife, and two children, host of relatives and well-wishers but the prosecution failed to examine any of them without any proper explanation. So, the legal presumption would be had they been examined, they would not have supported the prosecution case. In the instant case we also find that P.Ws. 4,6,7,11 and 12 deposed as the eye witnesses to the occurrence and P.Ws. 2 and 3 were examined  to corroborate the prosecution case particularly the eye witnesses and P.W. 1 was examined to corroborate his own statements made in the first information report but on close scrutiny of their evidence we find that evidence of all the prosecution witnesses suffer from glaring contradictions inconsistencies and infirmaties. So the same are vulnerable to the credibility and it is very difficulty to believe their testimony. Moreover, it is the definite case of the prosecution that there was an internal feud between the parties and when there is a background of enmity and the witnesses are chance witnesses and not natural witnesses and further natural and independent witness were not produced, it is unsafe to rely on the evidence of chance witnesses to make a nexus between the accused and the crime. So we hold that there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the accused with the crime of murder. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br/> <br/>It is pertinent to point out that the learned Judge convicted one set of accused and acquitted other set over the selfsame of evidence on record. There is no mis-match or distinction between the acquitted accused and the convicts so far as the ocular testimony is concern. The eye witnesses having been disbelieved against one set of accused should not be believed against other set without any independent corroboration.<br/> <br/>Having regard to the facts and the submissions advanced by the learned Deputy Attorney General we have gone through the decisions reported in 6 MLR (AD) 240, 53 DLR-464 and 5 BLC (AD)86 as referred by him. The facts leading to those cases are quite distinguishable to that of the instant case. Therefore, we are unable to accept his submissions. On the contrary the legal pleas taken by the defence and the submissions advanced by the learned Counsels for the defence prevail and appear to have a good deal of force.<br/> <br/>In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the  authorities referred to above, we are of the view that the prosecution measurably failed to prove the charge against the condemned prisoners beyond all reasonable doubt.  So, the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence suffers from legal infirmities, which calls for interference by this Court. Thus the death reference and Government Criminal Appeal No. 22 of 2005 having no merit fails and all the criminal appeals having merit succeed.<br/> <br/>In the result:-<br/>(a) The Death reference is rejected. The impugned Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 03-08-2005 passed by learned Judge of Druto Bichar Tribunal, Rajshahi in Druto Bichar Tribunal Case no. 24 of 2005, is hereby set aside. The condemned prisoners are acquitted from the charge leveled against them and they be set at libery if not detained in any other case.<br/>(b) All the Criminal appeals are allowed and the appellants are set at liberty if not detained in any other case;<br/>(c) The Government Criminal appeal No. 22 of 2005 is dismissed.<br/><br/>The office is directed to send down the records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Case No. 47 of 2009 should not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. By the Rule issuing order dated 17.6.2012 operation of the impugned judgment and order dated 14.5.2012 passed in Appeal No. 615 of 2011 was stayed.<br/> <br/>The facts leading to disposal of the Rule, are briefly stated below:<br/>        <br/>The petitioner is the Chairman of Board of Trustee of Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. Company’s Profit (Workers Participation) Fund and Welfare Fund of the proforma respondent No. 22, a company incorporated under Companies Act and the respondent No. 23 is the Factory Commercial Manager and Secretary of Board of Trustee (Workers Participation) and Welfare Fund, Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. and the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are workers of the proforma respondent No. 22 company namely Unilever Bangladesh Ltd.<br/> <br/>The said respondent Nos. 3 to 21 filed I.R. Case No. 47 of 2009 in the second labour court, Chittagong invoking section 213 of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ impleading the writ petitioner and the respondent Nos. 22 and 23 stating inter alia that they are employees of Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. and have been eligible to obtain share of profits of the company as per provisions of Company’s Profits (Workers Participation) Act, 1968.<br/> <br/>Since the earlier enactment namely Company’s Profit (Workers Participation) Act, 1968 was repealed the said respondent Nos. 3 to 21 claimed themselves as the workers as defined in section 233 (S) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ who are not concerned with the managerial or administrative nature of work of the company and they are eligible to get the said benefit of fund in question under বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ from the fund year 2007.<br/><br/>The petitioner contested the said I.R. case upon filing a written statement contending inter alia that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are not workers rather they fall within the meaning of employer as defined in section 2 (49) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ and they are not legally entitled to get share of Company’s Profit (Workers Participation) Fund and Welfare Fund.<br/><br/>To prove the respective cases of the parties the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 produced and examined one witness as P.W. 1 namely Mohammad Ibrahim who deposed for himself and on behalf of other respondents (1<sup>st</sup> parties) on the other hand the petitioner also produced one witness as D.W. 1. Besides, both the parties produced some papers which were duly exhibited in the I.R case before the 2<sup>nd</sup> labour court, Chittagong.<br/><br/>The said labour court framed only one issue to determine the case as to whether the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 i.e. first party in the labour court are entitled to get any share of profit from Company’s Profit (Workers Participation) Fund.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the parties and on consideration of the materials on record the labour court allowed the case of the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 by its judgment dated 26.10.2011.<br/><br/>Thereafter unsuccessful petitioner preferred appeal against the said judgment of the labour court dated 26.10.2011 before the Labour Appellate Tribunal being Appeal No. 615 of 2011 and the learned Chairman of the Labour Appellate Tribunal after hearing the parties and also on consideration of the materials on record dismissed the appeal and thereby affirmed the judgment of the labour court by his judgment and order dated 14.5.2012.<br/><br/>Then the petitioner approached this Court and obtained the present Rule and order of stay as stated above.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdur Razzaq Khan, the learned Advocate, appearing with Mr. Mahabubul Hoq and Mr. Nesar Ahmed, Advocates on behalf of the petitioner having placed the evidence on record including the impugned judgment submits that the labour court and the Labour Appellate Tribunal illegally and improperly failed to distinguish the definition of ‘worker’ as defined in section 2 (65) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ with the definition given in section 233 of the same Ain.<br/><br/>Mr. Khan, the learned Advocate submits further that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 failed to establish their claim and status as ‘worker’ and they did not adduce any evidence for their entitlement of fund benefit as defined in section 234 of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ and as such both the courts below acted without lawful basis and both the judgment of labour court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal should be declared to be without lawful authority and are of no legal effect.<br/><br/>Mr. Khan, the learned Advocate next submits that both the labour court and the Labour Appellate Tribunal failed to consider that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 fall within the category of employer as defined in section 2 (49) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ and in such view of the matter the impugned judgment should be declared without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>Mr. Khan, finally submits that the labour court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal have fallen into grave error of law taking into consideration of the judgment passed by this Court in Writ Petition No. 5111 of 2008 filed by one Md. Jalaluddin, a Junior Store Officer of Meghna Petroleum Ltd. inspite of the fact that there is no relevance  to the facts and circumstances of the present case with the judgment of the said writ petition on that count the impugned judgment should be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>On the other hand Mr. Mohsan Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing with Mr. Md.Mahabub Monzur and Mr.Rakibul Hasan, Advocates on behalf of the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 by filing affidavit-in-opposition and supporting the judgment of the labour court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal submits that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are the workers of the company as defined in section 233 (S) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ and they are legally entitled to get benefit of the Company’s Profit (Workers Participation) Fund.<br/><br/>Mr. Chowdhury, the learned Advocate in support of his submission has given emphasis upon the decision passed in Writ Petition No. 5111 of 2008 and submits that the decision which has been given by this Court in the said writ petition is exactly similar and identical to that of the present case in the hand and as such the Rule should be discharged.<br/><br/>Mr. Chowdhury also referred to another unreported judgment of this Court and submits that similar views were also taken by this Court in writ petition No.5024 of 2012 in the case of Mr. Abu Taher vs. Bangladesh and others.<br/>We have heard the learned Advocates of both the sides and perused the impugned judg-ment including the writ petition, annexures, affidavit-in-opposition and affidavit-in- replay thereto  and also gone through the decisions as referred to, wherefrom it transpires that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 as the first party by filing I.R. Case before the labour court, Chittagong against the writ petitioner and respondent Nos. 22 and 23 as the second party claiming themselves as the employee of the respondent No. 22- Company being the Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. and praying for obtaining share from the workers’ profit and participation fund including their arrear with effect from fund year 2007 onward.<br/><br/>The labour court as well as Labour Appellate Tribunal allowed the case of the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 found them as workers of the company  as defined in section 233 (S) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬।<br/><br/>So we have to look into the provision of section 233 (S) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ which reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>২৩৩. বিশেষ সংজ্ঞা-(১) বিষয় বা প্রসংগের পরিপন্থীকোন কিছু না থাকিলে, এই অধ্যায়ে-<br/>(ক) --------------------<br/>(খ) ---------------------<br/>(গ) ---------------------<br/>(ঙ) ---------------------<br/>(চ) ---------------------<br/>(ছ) ---------------------<br/>(জ) কোন কোম্পানীর শ্রমিক বলিতে ঐ ব্যক্তিকে বুঝাইবে যিনি পদ-মর্যাদা নির্বিশেষে উক্ত কোম্পানীতে অন্যুন ছয়মাস যাবত চাকুরীতে নিযুক্ত রহিয়াছেন, তবে নিম্নোক্ত কোন ব্যক্তি এই আইনের আওতায় শ্রমিক সংজ্ঞার অন্তর্ভুক্ত হইবেন না-<br/>(১) ব্যবস্থাপনা কিংবা প্রশাসনিক দায়িত্বে নিযুক্ত ব্যক্তি,<br/>(২) তদারকি কর্তৃত্বে নিযুক্ত ব্যাক্তি যিনি পদাধিকারবলে বা তাহার উপর অর্পিত ক্ষমতাবলে ব্যবস্থাপনা বা প্রশাসনিক ধরনের কাজ করিয়া থাকেন</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This provision of section 233 (S) and other provisions of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ came into operation after repealing the provisions of Company’s Profits (Workers Participation) Act, 1968 wherein the new enactment the definition of ‘শ্রমিক’ in the case of getting workers’ profit fund has been clearly defined in section 233 (S) and that speaks’ the words “irrespective of designation” (পদ মর্যাদা নির্বিশেষে)।<br/><br/>Both the labour court as well as the Labour Appellate Tribunal mainly passed the judgments and orders allowing the case of the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 holding that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are the workers in view of the Act itself and the decision of a judgment passed by this Court in Writ Petition No. 5111 of 2008 filed by one Md. Jalaluddin, a Junior Officer of Meghna Petroleum Ltd.<br/><br/>So far the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are not fallen within the definition of workers, they performed managerial and administrative functions of the company and they are not entitled to get the benefit from the said welfare fund. We hold that the petitioner could not show/produce any evidence on record that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 were the part of management of respondent No. 22- Company or they were ever holding any managerial, administrative or supervisory function of the same. It is pertinent to mention here that mere designation does not determine whether an employee is an Officer or a Worker which is clearly embodied in section 233(S) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ wording “<strong><u>পদ মর্যাদা নির্বিশেষে</u></strong><strong><u>”</u></strong> (under line is given by us.)<br/><br/>In the judgment of the Writ Petition No. 5111 of 2008 we find that the petitioner of that writ petition was appointed as Junior Operation Officer and subsequently promoted as Senior Field Engineer who got the benefits of workers participation fund holding the view that his job was not that of managerial or supervisory in nature.<br/><br/>The principle enunciated by this Court in Writ Petition Nos. 5111 of 2008 and Writ Petition No. 5024 of 2012 are applicable in the present facts and circumstances of the instant case before us and also in all cases of similar facts and involving similar point of law irrespective of difference of job description.<br/><br/>From the evidence on record we find that the petitioner has not been able to prove that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 were ever engaged in or performed managerial or supervisory job. We also hold that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 fall within the definition of section 233 (S) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ and they are entitled to get benefits of (Workers Participation) Fund and Welfare Fund as prayed for.<br/><br/>We have noticed that the judgment of Writ Petition No. 5111 of 2008 making the Rule absolute by this Court infavour of a worker was challenged by a Leave Petition being No. 1732 of 2009 to the Appellate Division and the leave was granted but subsequently the same was withdrawn.<br/><br/>So it can safely be said that the judgment passed in Writ Petition No. 5111 of 2008 is still in force whereby the definition of worker has been settled by this Court in view of the provision of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬.<br/><br/>It is pertinent to mention here that the Appellate Division in the case of Chief Engineer, the Local Government and Engineering Department and others Vs. Kazi Mizanur Rahman and 8 others reported in 17 BLC (AD) (2012) observed about the conflicting opinions of different Benches of the High Court Division in the following manner:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><em>There should not be conflicting opinions</em><em> of different Benches of the High Court Division sitting on coordinate jurisdiction. When there will be different opinions on a particular point, it will be difficult for the executive to follow the directions. Whenever, a Division Bench of the High Court Division is called upon to decide question of law, it becomes its duty to ascertain whether any pronouncement of the High Court Division exists on the point and the best procedure is to follow the said opinion. If it does not accept the decision as correct, it may refer the matter to a Full Bench after formulating the point on which it differs on the point of law. If the facts are distinguishable then it can decide the question of law on the facts of the given case.</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate for the petitioner has drawn our attention that the name of the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are not available in the member list of trade union which implies that they are not worker. In this regard we hold that the member list of trade union cannot be the determining factor of whether one is a worker or not ignoring the prevailing law wherein definition of the expression “worker” has been clearly spelt out.<br/><br/>It is also necessary to mention here that the respondent No.22 company is the appropriate authority to say whether its employees i.e. respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are its workers or not. But it appears that the company (respondent No.22) as the 2<sup>nd</sup> party No.1 in the labour court did not come forward to prove that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are not the workers of the company or they ever performed managerial or administrative functions of the company. Though the respondent No. 22-company by filing a written statement wanted to say that the fund in question will be distributed among the eligible member of the company and who are the eligible to get it would be determined as per provision of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬ but after filing a written statement the company did not turn up to contest the claim.<br/><br/>So, on that count we hold that the respondent No.22-company like the petitioner failed to show that the respondent Nos.3 to 21 ever performed the managerial or administrative functions of the company other than workers.<br/>In conclusion we hold that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 are the workers of the respondent No. 22- company and they are entitled to get benefit from the (Worker Participation) Profit Fund. On the other hand we do not find any evidence from the materials on record to show that the respondent Nos. 3 to 21 fall within the exception of section 233 (S) of বাংলাদেশ শ্রম আইন, ২০০৬।<br/><br/>In the light of the discussions made herein above we do not find substance in the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged. However without any order as to cost.<br/><br/>Send this judgment to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Labour Court, Chittagong and the Labour Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka along with the lower courts record.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
