Abu Tariq, J: </u></strong></span><br/> <br/>This Rule is directed against the judgment and decree dated 11-04-2004 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Gazipur in Title Appeal No. 161 of 1996 affirming the judgment and decree dated 31-08-1996 passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Kapasia in Title Suit No. 430 of 1979 renumbered as Title Suit No. 37 of 1995 decreeing the suit in-part.<br/><br/>The case of the plaintiff, in short, is that the suit land originally belonged to Akabbor Dewan who gifted the same to his wife Anari Bibi and C.S. khatian was recorded in her name. Anari Bibi died leaving behind 03 daughters namely (1) Talukjan Bibi, (2) Kadarjan Bibi and (3) Anisa Bibi as heirs. Talukjan Bibi died leaving behind only daughter Samiron Nessa and this Samiron Nessa sold her entire share to Maniruddin Bapari (father of the defendant No.01-07). Kadarjan Bibi died leaving behind 03 sons namely (1) Bhomor Bapari (plaintiff), (2) Maniruddin Bapari (father of the defendant no 01-07) and (3) Hossainuddin Bapari and 02 daughters namely (1) Shohagi and (2) Nekjan Bibi. These two sisters (Shohagi and Nekjan Bibi) sold their entire share to Maniruddin Bapari.  The plaintiff sold his entire share to one Noimuddin and subsequently Noimuddin sold the same to Maniruddin Bapari by registered deed. Subsequently the plaintiff purchased .22 decimals of land from his brother Hossainuddin Bapari by registered deed dated 22-02-1953 in C.S plot No.110 and since purchase the plaintiff has been in possession to the suit land in esmali property with other co-shares. The plaintiff and Maniruddin Bapari were co-sharers in the suit land but S.A and R.S. khatian were recorded wrongly in the name of only Maniruddin Bapari excluding the name of the plaintiff.  The plaintiff requested the defendants (sons of Maniruddin Bapari) for amicable partition of the suit property but the defendants did not response to the request. Hence, the suit for partition.<br/><br/>The defendant-opposite party (1 to 7) contested the suit by filing written statements contending, inter alia, that the suit land originally belonged to Anari Bibi in C.S. record, who got the same from her husband Ekabbar Dewan. Anari Bibi died leaving behind 03 daughters namely (1) Talukjan Bibi, (2) Gafarjan Bibi and (3) Afroza Bibi. Talukjan died leaving behind one daughter Samiron Nesa and this Samiron Nesa sold her entire share to Maniruddin Bapari (father of the defendant no.01-07). Gafarjan Bibi died leaving behind 03 sons namely (1) Bhomor Bapari (plaintiff), (2) Maniruddin Bapari and (3) Hossainuddin Bepari and 02 daughters namely Shohagi and Nekjan. Afroza Bibi died leaving behind 02 sons namely, Basiruddin and Sana Ullah. Basiruddin died leaving behind only son Tasiruddin. Afroza Bibi died leaving behind only son Sanaulla and Sanaullah died leaving behind a son Samsuddin. Sumsuddin sold his entire share to Maniruddin Bepari (father of the defendant No.1-7). The plaintiff Bhomor Bapari inherited .25 decimals of land from his mother Gafarjan Bibi, but he sold .47 decimals of land by two registered deeds to the predecessor of the defendants and by this he sold .22 decimals beyond his title. In the transaction mentioned above Maniruddin Bapari acquired the total .46 ½ decimals of land and accordingly S.A and R.S record was prepared in his name. The plaintiff transferred his entire property to the predecessor of the defendants and the plaintiff or his heirs are not in possession to the suit land thus the plaintiff filed the suit claming false title and therefore the suit in liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>The plaintiff and the contesting defendants examined P. Ws. and D. Ws. in support of their respective cases and both the parties adduced some documentary evidence.<br/><br/>The learned Assistant Judge, on consideration of the materials on record decreed the suit in part holding that the plaintiff is entitled to get .22½ decimals of land. Then the defendants preferred Title Appeal No.161 of 1996 before the learned District Judge, Gazipur and on transfer, the Title Appeal was heard by the learned Joint District Judge, Court No. 2, Gazipur who by the judgment and decree dated 11-04-2004 affirmed the judgment and decree of the trial Court. Then the petitioner moved this Revisional application before this Court and obtained the present Rule.  <br/><br/>Mr. Sadananda Rana, learned Advocate for the defendant-petitioner submits that the plaintiff did not own .46 ½ decimals of land in the C.S. Khatian No.18, but he erroneously transferred the land by Exhibit-B and C (registered deed) which was in excess of .23½ decimals of land. But subsequently the plaintiff purchased .22½ acres of land from his brother Hassainuddin Bepari by Exhibit-2 and by this, the wanting title of the plaintiff was cured and the defendants got title in the whole of .46½ decimals in C.S. Khatian No.18. The Courts below acted illegally in not finding the title of the defendants for entire .46½ decimals of land in their favour by invoking section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act. The learned Advocate further submits that both the Courts below failed to consider the effect of section 43 of the Transfer of property Act in the transactions and failed to construe the said section in arriving at correct finding that the defendant No.1 to 7 acquired title of the whole of .46½ acres of the land on the basis of Doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel. In this connection, the learned Advocate referred the decision reported in 7 D.L.R. (F.C) 70 and 55 D.L.R. (HC) 257 and submitted that the decisions entirely covered the points of law and support clearly the claim of defendant No. 1 to 7 in the whole of .46½ decimals of land by dint of his purchase from the plaintiff. The Courts below erred in law in decreeing the suit in part without considering the Doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel provided in section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act and section 115 of the Evidence Act.<br/><br/>Mr. A. B. M. Matiur Rahman, learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party submits that both the Courts below after observing all necessary documents, examining the P. Ws and D. Ws rightly passed the judgment and decree allowing partition partly for which there is no scope to interfere with the same and as such the Rule may be discharged.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned Advocates of both the parties and perused the revisional application and other materials on record. It appears that Bhomar Bepari, the predecessor of the plaintiffs and Maniruddin Bepari, predecessor of the contesting defendants No.1-7 are full brothers. Bhomar Bepari initially inherited .22½ decimals of land, but he sold .46½ decimals to his brother Maniruddin Bepari by registered deed (exhibit B and C). It was in excess of .23½ decimals of his transferable title. But subsequently Bhomar Bepari purchased .22½ decimals of land from his another brother Husainuddin Bepari by registered deed (exhibit-2) and by this purchase, he got wanting title to the land which he had transferred earlier without title. <strong>The provision of law in this regard provided in section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act as the principle of feeding the estoppel that where in the case of a sale an erroneous representation is made by the transferor that he is the full owner of the land sold, then if the transferor happens later to obtain the real title on that land, the previous transfer shall be operated on that title. In this regard section 115 of the Evidence Act is relevant that when a person fraudulently or erroneously transfers certain land in which he had no title at the time of such transfer, but the transferor subsequently acquired title in the said land, the benefit of such acquisition shall go to the transferee on the principle of feeding the estoppel.</strong> In the present case, the plaintiff Bhomar Bepari intentionally and falsely lead the predecessor of the defendants, the predecessor of the defendant No.1-7 to believe that the land in question belonged to the plaintiff and thereby he induced the said Maniruddin Bepari to buy and pay for it. Subsequently, the plaintiff purchased .22 ½ decimals of land from his brother Hussainuddin Bepari and acquired title. Now the plaintiff must not be allowed to prove his want of title that at the time of the sale, he had no title in the land.<br/><br/>The doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel which appears as the solitary illustration of section 115 of the Evidence Act and in section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act is based on the ground that if a person, for value received, conveys what he does not own but subsequently he acquires the title which he conveyed, then against him similarly <strong>section 18 of the Specific Relief Act recognizes as enforceable at law the right of a person contracting to purchase or to take in lease property from a person who at the time of the contract does not own it but subsequently acquired it.</strong> In the decision reported in 55 D.L.R. (HC) 257 Omar Ali Shikh .Vs. Shamsul Alam Mridha and others held that where a person having partial interest in certain property, transfers a larger interest and subsequently acquired that interest, in that case the provision of section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act applies and the transferee is entitled to get interest so acquired.<br/><br/>Since Vromor Bepari received the value and conveyed the land to the predecessor of the defendants, what he did not own but subseq-uently he acquired title which he conveyed to the predecessor of the defendants can legally enforce the conveyance against the plaintiffs who where the heirs of Vhomar Bepari on the basis of Doctrine of feeding the grant by estoppel. The Courts below failed to consider this important point of law and committed error in law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.<br/><br/>In view of the discussion made above and the facts and circumstances, legal provision and the decision cited above I find merit in the Rule and the judgment and decree by the Courts below suffer from illegality and thus the Rule having merit succeeded.<br/><br/>In the result, the rule is made absolute.<br/><br/>The impugned judgment and decree dated 11-04-2004 passed by learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court Gazipur in Title Appeal No.161 of 1996 affirming the judgment and decree dated 31-08-1996 passed by learned Senior Assistant Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Kapasia, District Gazipur in Title Suit No. 37 of 1995 is hereby set aside and dismissed the suit.<br/><br/>There will be, however no order as to cost.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court records expeditiously.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

But in MRR survey the suit land have been wrongly recorded in the name of Sailendra and others as such, Abdul Latif filed Title Suit No.77 of 1969 in which government of East Pakistan was defendant No.7. Suit was decreed on compromise on 18.9.1974 and on the strength of the decree, Abdul Latif corrected the MRR khatian and mutated his name in Case No.84 of 1974-75 and paid rents to the government regularly. Abdul Latif died leaving behind 2 sons, plaintiff Nos.1 and 2, 5 daughters and wife. Three daughters and wife of Abdul Latif sold their shares to the plaintiff Nos.1 and 2. These plaintiffs along with their two sisters, plaintiff Nos.3 and 4, mutated their names in the record of rights vide Mutation Case No.665 of 1987-88. The present D.P. khatian was prepared in the name of these plaintiffs and they are paying rents for the suit land. But on 4.10.1998 when plaintiff No.1 went to pay rents, defendants refused to accept the rents on the plea that suit property is vested and non resident property and they would lease out the property, hence the suit.<br/> <br/>Defendants Nos.1-3 appeared and contested the suit and in their written statement it is stated that during 1965 war, original Hindu owners left for India, settled there, acquired Indian citizenship and their properties were listed as vested property. The government leased out the property. It is their further case that papers filed by the plaintiffs over the suit property are forged, false, concocted and without any consideration.<br/> <br/>The case of defendant Nos.4-10 in their written statement is that .26 acres of land of the suit plot being vested and non resident property was leased out to one Mohammadullha and Sahadullah vide VPSC list No.49 of 1967-98 and they paying rent to the Government and they possessing the land and when they failed to pay rent, notices were served upon them and after such notice they paid rent. Mohammadullah died leaving these defendants who got possession over .13 acres of land out of .26 acres of land and they prayed for getting lease in their favour, their prayer was accepted and they paid rents to the government up to 1405 B.S. The suit of the plaintiffs is liable to be dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/>Learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Lakshmipur on the pleadings of the parties framed 6 issues are as follows:<br/>       " i. Is the suit maintainable in its present from;<br/>        ii. Is there any cause of action for the suit;<br/>       iii. Is the suit barred by limitation;<br/>       iv. Is the plaintiffs have absolute right, title and interest over 3.29 acres of schedule kha of the plaint.<br/>       v. Is 3.29 acres of schedule Kha property is vested or non resident property;<br/>      vi. Is the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree declaring that 3.29 acres of schedule Kha of the plaint is not a vested and nor resident property."<br/> <br/>In the suit plaintiff examined 3 witnesses including plaintiff No.1 and exhibited certified copies of different khatians, rent receipts and Judgment and Decree of Title Suit No.77 of 1969. Defendant Nos.1-3 examine tahshildar of local Dalal bazar and also exhibited M.R.R. khatians and also V.P. lists exhibited as exhibits ka and kha series. Defendant Nos.4-10 examined defendant No.4 and other 2 witnesses and exhibited D.C.R, certified copies of V.P.S.P. and application filed for renewal of lease exhibited as Ka, kha and ga series.<br/> <br/>Learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit which was affirmed by the learned Judge of the appellate Court.<br/> <br/>Mrs. Sadia Rowshan Jahan, learned Advocate, appearing for the petitioners, submits that, both the Courts below committed gross illegality in dismissing the suit holding that judgment and decree on compromise obtained in Title Suit No.77 of 1969 by which plaintiffs derived their title was product of forgery without framing any issue to that effect. Learned Advocate further submits that the judgment of the appellate Court just carbon copy of the trial Court as such this judgment can not be sustainable as it is bad order, such type of judgment should be thrown out as learned Judge of the appellate Court did not apply his judicial mind.<br/> <br/>Mr. S.S. Sarker, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing for the opposite parties, submits that, the judgment of the appellate court is same of the trial Court. Learned Deputy Attorney General submits that it should not be kept on record and it should be set aside and appeal should be remanded to the learned Judge of the appellate Court for re-hearing.<br/> <br/>On consideration of the judgment of the trial Court I find that learned Judge of the trial Court set aside the judgment passed in Title Suit No.77 of 1969 without framing any issue. It also appears that learned Judge did not at all consider the case of the plaintiffs, the question of binapatra and also learned Judge did not at all address to the different issues framed by him on the ground that plaintiffs' title has not been proved in Title Suit No.77 of 1969. On a reading of the judgment I find that 90% judgment relating to the judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No.77 of 1969. The appellate Court's Judgment I find just a copy of the trial Court judgment and according to me learned Judge totally did not at all applied his judicial mind in dispossing of the appeal. Order XLI rule 31 of the code of civil procedure speaks how and in what manner the judgment of the appellate Court should be written, law says it shall be in writing and shall state (a) the points for determination, (b) the decision thereon, (c) the reasons for the decision, and (d) where the decree appealed from is reversed or varied, the relief to which the appellant is entitled.<br/> <br/>On a reading of the appellate Court's judgment I find that appellate Court's judgment totally a carbon copy the judgment of the trial court. This Judgment, I find totally disregard the provision of law as mentioned herein above. I also find that trial Court on the question of judgment and decree obtained in Title Suit No.77 of 1969 did not frame any issue as such the plaintiffs could not led any evidence to prove that said judgment was passed in accordance with law. Although I am not in favour of remand of any suit as it put litigant to further harassment but when judgment of the Court's below suffered from illegality I have no other option but to send the suit back on remand. I find substance in this rule.<br/> <br/>In the result this rule is made absolute. No costs.<br/>The Judgment and decree dated 10.6.2004 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Lakshmipur in Title Appeal No.43 of 2001 affirming those dated 27.2.2001 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Lakshmipur in Title Suit No.40 of 1998 are set aside.<br/> <br/>Title Suit No.40 of 1998 is sent back to the Court of the learned Subordinate Judge, 1st Court, Lakshmpur for a fresh trial after framing proper issue and allowing the parties to adduce evidence on the question whether judgment and decree passed in Title Suit No.77 of 1969 was passed legally or not.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower Court records at once.<br/> <br/>Communicate this order at once.    <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Barik Munshi for mediation of their family problem. Selina Khatoon along with her younger sister Rokeya Khatoon and younger brother Md. Abu Bakkar Siddique (Babul) started for the house of Barik Munshi at about 4:00 p.m. Previously, also on the direction of Abdur Rashid, Selina Khatoon visited the house of Barik Munshi on several occasions.  The informant came to know from Md. Nasir Hossain (P.W.10) that Selina Khatoon, Rokeya Khatoon and Abu Bakar Siddique had been lying senseless in the house of Barik Munshi. Dr. Md. Waheduzzaman had gone to the house of Barik Munshi and declared all three victims dead. The informant thereafter came to know that Abdur Rashid, Md. Barik Munshi, Md. Dudumia, Abdus Salam Sarker, Abdus Samad Sarker, Motin Sarker and Raishuddin Sarkar killed Selina Khatoon, Rokeya Khatoon and Abu Bakker Siddique by giving them poison. <br/><br/>The Investigating Officer visited the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map with index, prepared inquest report, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. After completion of investigation he submitted Charge-sheet under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against 7 (seven) accused persons.<br/><br/>During trial the prosecution examined as many as 19 P.Ws. including Dr. Abdul Quader (P.W.12) who held the autopsy of the three deceased.  <br/><br/>The defence case, as it transpires from the trend of cross-examination was that the accused persons were innocent and the accused did not claim any dowry and no trouble occurred in respect of dowry. The victims committed suicide for unknown reasons. <br/><br/>The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Sirajgonj after hearing the parties and considering the evidence and materials on record convicted the appellant under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced him to death by his judgement and order dated 18.07.2001. All the other accused were acquitted.<br/><br/>Reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death, which was registered as Death Reference No.30 of 2001.<br/><br/>Before the High Court Division Criminal Appeal No. 2840 of 2001 and Jail Appeal No.2884 of 2001 were preferred by the condemned prisoner, which were heard along with the death reference.<br/><br/>By the impugned judgement and order, the High Court Division rejected the reference and dismissed the Criminal Appeal No. 2840 of 2001 and Jail Appeal No. 2884 of 2001 with modification of sentence as stated above.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division the appellant preferred Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 202 of 2004 before this Division. Leave was granted to consider whether the High Court Division was in error in not considering important facts such as: there was no occasion of the appellant to invite the deceased Selina to the house of Barik Munshi for reconciliation and it was not possible that for the purpose of reconciliation she would take with her a younger brother and sister instead of her father and older brother; that reconciliation would be held in the house of Barik Munshi instead of holding the same before the local Chairman to whom notice of divorce was given; and that there was no evidence at all as to who administered the poison to Selina, her younger brother and sister or how it was done and the circumstantial evidence does not lead to the presumption that the appellant administered the poison.<br/><br/>Mrs. Sufia Khatun, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the judgement and order passed by the High Court Division is neither proper nor in accordance with law. She further submitted that in view of the facts, the High Court Division did not follow the established principles of assessment of evidence hence there has occasioned a gross failure of justice. The learned Advocate further submitted that since there was no eye witness in the said case as to who saw the accused administering poison to the deceased, as such relying on the so called circumstantial evidence was not lawful to find the convict appellant guilty of the murder of the deceased. She lastly submitted the High Court Division convicted the appellant totally on suspicion, conjecture and moral conviction rather than legal evidence.<br/><br/>Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath, learned D.A.G. appearing on behalf of the respondent made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of conviction and sentence. He further submitted that there is clear evidence from the prosecution witnesses, namely P.W. 9 and P.W. 13 that the victims were called away by the accused and were last seen in the company of the accused and hence the accused has a special responsibility under the criminal law to explain the death of the victims. He submitted that all the circumst-antial evidence led to the conclusion that the accused appellant called away the victims from their house, took them to the house of Barik Munshi where they died due to poison administered in their food. He pointed out that the evidence of P.W. 2 supports the prosecution case that when he went to the house of Barik Munshi he saw the victims screaming and found the accused along with others inside the house watching the victims screaming “বাঁচাও বাঁচাও”  Thereafter, he was chased away by the accused persons.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate-on-Record for the appellant and the learned Deputy Attorney General for the Respondent and perused the impugned judgement of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>Upon scrutiny of the evidence we find that, according to the F.I.R. the occurrence took place at 10:00 p.m. following 31.1.1995 and the F.I.R. was lodged at 9:30 a.m. on 01.02.1995. The informant stated in the F.I.R. that he heard from one Nabir Hossain that his sister Selina along with another sister Rokeya and brother Abu Bakkar Siddique (Babul) were lying unconscious in the house of Barik Munshi, he sent doctor Md. Wahiduzzaman, Serajul Islam Harmuj along with Lal Miah on a motorcycle to the place of occurrence. As P.W. 1 the informant corroborated his statement as made in the F.I.R. We note that there was no mention by the informant that he informed his brother Helal Uddin (P.W.2) or that P.W.2 informed him about going to the house of Barik Munshi and finding Selina, Rokeya and Abu Bakkar screaming for help and the accused persons watching them and, thereafter, chasing them. We cannot believe that such an important fact and vivid description by P.W. 2 would not have been narrated to his brother-the informant during the night of occurrence and would not therefore be reflected in the F.I.R. If the informant is to be believed then the first persons to reach the place of occurrence on his intimation would have been Dr. Wahidu-zzaman, Serajul Islam and Lal Miah who on their arrival found the victims dead. We also note that the prosecution has not examined Dr. Wahiduzzaman who in our view is a most relevant witness. P.W. 10 Nabir Hossain who allegedly informed Jahangir, the informant (P.W.1) about the victims, stated in his deposition that having heard the news about someone being poisoned in Barik Munshi’s house he went to the place of occurrence and found the 3 persons lying in the Courtyard. Hence, it would appear that the victims had already died even before Nabir Hossain reached the place of occurrence. The failure of the informant to mention anything about his brother P.W.2 Helal Uddin, who claimed to have heard about the victims from his brother Jahangir (the informant), is clearly an embellishment. It is clear upon scrutiny of the evidence that Jahangir first heard about the occurrence from Nabir Hossain, who reported the matter to the informant after visiting the place of occurrence where the victims had already died. Therefore, it is highly improbable that upon hearing about the matter from Jahangir, Helal would go to the place of occurrence and find the victims alive and screaming for help.<br/><br/>With regard to the presence of the accused at the time of occurrence, P.W.5 Bellal Hossain stated that when he arrived on his motorcycle, the victims were already dead and upon hearing the sound of the motorcycle the accused persons fled. However from the cross-examination of the Investigating Officer( P.W.18) we find that Bellal Hossain did not say to the Investigating Officer that the accused persons escaped upon hearing the sound of the motorcycle. The presence of Helal at the place of occurrence is introduced by Bellal Hossain (P.W.5) who stated in his deposition that Lal Miah (Lutfur Rahman Lal) (P.W.8) stated that Helal is somewhere near and to search for him, but according to the Investigating Officer, Lal Miah did not say so in his statement under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/><br/>With regard to the application of the concept “last seen”, learned D.A.G. submitted that the fact of calling and taking away by the accused appellant is proved by the evidence of prosecution witnesses, we find from the evidence of the Investigating Officer (P.W.17) that Sarmin (P.W. 9) did not tell him that the appellant called and took away the three victims. In any event even if it is proved that the appellant called the victims away and was seen in his company going towards the house of Barik Munshi, when he arrived there and is found in the presence of others in the house of Barik Munshi, which is admitted by the prosecution, his exclusive responsibility to explain what happened to the victims ends. The chain of circumstances is thus broken. What happened in the house of Barik Munshi where persons other than the appellant were also present is for Barik Munshi to explain.    <br/><br/>In the facts and circumstances discussed above, we find that the prosecution did not prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, accordingly, he is found not guilty of the offence as charged.<br/><br/>         Accordingly, the criminal appeal is allowed. The judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed against the convict appellant Md. Abdur Rashid is hereby set-aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled against him and may be released forthwith if not wanted in connection with any other case.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Even the Charge sheet that has been filed in the present case can not be treated as complaint in as much as the said charge sheet being a police report can not be regarded as a complaint within the meaning of section 4(1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure that is the complain  given under the section excluded the report of a  police officer. The lodgment of the F.I.R by the sub inspector of police Md. Mizanur Rahman, submission of charge  sheet dated 1.6.2007 by S.I. Mohammad Shahid Uddin and cognizance taken by the tribunal and therefore framing of charge by the said tribunal against the appellant in the present case be contrary to and in violation of requirements of section 23(2) and (3) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 are bad in law. In the present case the police officer along with the combined force has in contravention of the safe guard provided in </strong><strong>section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation</strong><strong> Act, 1947 initiated the present criminal case against the appellant by lodging the F.I.R treating the alleged offence under the said Act. Neither getting any letter of authority nor it has been lodged by the Bangladesh Bank. Though a permission has been given by the Bangladesh Bank about one month later from the date of occurrence  as well as arrest of the appellant and on consideration  the evidence  of P.W. 18 who issued letter  of permission  ext. 7 after 1 month without  any reasons  thus a suggestion was given  from the defence  as mechanical permission so the FIR. itself is a malafide one under the facts and circumstances of the case. The lodgment of the F.I.R can not be construed to have accorded the requisite authority to the informant to lodge the present criminal case against the appellant under the Foreign Exchange Regulation. So the initiation of the present case have not been validly initiated in terms of the requirements of Section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. . . .

He denied the suggestion of the prosecution.<br/><br/>We have considered the P.Ws and D.Ws along other material or records and in order to properly appreciate the submission of the learned advocates it is advisable to set out herein below section 19A and 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947 which reads as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">         19A. (1) The Government of Bangladesh Bank may, at any time cause an inspection to be made by one or more of its officers, of the books of accounts and other documents of any person firm or business organization or concern required to submit to the Bangladesh Bank any return, statement or information under this act and, where necessary , direct all such books of accounts and  other documents to be seized.<br/>         (2) Every such person, firm, business organization and concern shall produce books of accounts and other documents and furnish such statements and information to such officer or officers in connection with the inspection under Sub- section (1)<br/>         (3) Failure to produce any books of accounts or other documents or to furnish any statement or information required under Sub- section (2) shall be deemed to be contravention of the provisions of this Act.<br/>         23. (1) Whoever contravenes, attempts to contravene or abets the contravention of any of the provisions of this  Act or of any rules, direction or order made thereunder shall not withstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1898 be tried by a Tribunal constituted by section 23 A and shall be punishable with imprisonment for a  term which may extend to two years or with fine or  with both and any such Tribunal trying any such contravention may, if it thinks fit and in addition to any sentence which it may impose for such contravention , direct that any currency, security , gold or silver or goods or other property in respect of which the contravention has taken place shall be confiscated,<br/>         (2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 , any offence punishable under this section shall be cognizable for such period as the Government may from time to time, by notification in the official Gazette declare,<br/>         (3) A Tribunal shall not take cognizance of any offence punishable under this section and not declared  by the Government under the proceeding Sub- section to be cognizable for the time being or of an offence punishable under section 54 of the Income -tax Act, 1992 (IX of 1922) an applied by section 19 , except upon complaint in writing made by a person authorized by the Government or the Bangladesh Bank in this behalf.<br/>         Provided that where any such offences is the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or any rule, direction or order made thereunder which prohibits the doing of any act without permission and is not declared by the Bangladesh Government under the preceding Sub- Section to be cognizable for the time being, no such complaint shall be made unless the person accused of the offence has been given an opportunity of showing that he had such permission. <br/>         (4) Where the person guilty of an offence under this Act is a company or other body corporate every Director Manager, Secretary and other officer thereof who is knowingly a party to the offence shall also be guilty of the same offence and liable to the same punishment.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It appears from the above sections the government or the Bangladesh Bank has the power of inspection of the petitioner firm and thereafter the authority of Bangladesh Bank would to direct the appellant to produce the relevant papers and documents before the authority concern but in the particular case no such specific direction is available in the record and we also carefully read the section 23(1) of the said Act and it is apparently   shows that for commission of such offence of the said act, a complaint thereof can only be filed by a person authorized by the government or by the Bangladesh Bank. Further no such complaint can be filed unless the person accused of such offence has been given on opportunity to show cause that he had permission to do the act directed to submit account which in the absence of permission did not obey the direction in respect of submission of account properly would be a punishable offence under the act. The word complaint as appearing as sub- section -3 of Section 23 is not define in the said act.  In the absence of such definition in the foreign exchange regulation Act. The word complain should be taken to mean the complain defined under section 4 (1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 4(1)(h) reads as under “ 4(1)(h) complaint” . Complaint means the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under this Court that some person  whether known or unknown has committed an offence but it does not include  the report  of police officer.<br/><br/>The legal position as deducted from the above discussion that incourse of any contravention of any provision of foreign exchange regulation act etc.  Complained should be filed before the Magistrate by the person authorized in this behalf either by the government or by the Bangladesh Bank and not by lodging any F.I.R by any unauthorized police officer   and this apart, lodgment of such complain should be followed by an opportunity given to the accused person to show whether he had maintained his account properly or not.<br/><br/>But in the present case the F.I.R was lodged by the S.I. of police after about one month from the date  of his arrest and that was too without any authority which was required under section 23(3) of the foreign exchange regulation act 1947. Even the Charge sheet that has been filed in the present case can not be treated as complaint in as much as the said charge sheet being a police report can not be regarded as a complaint within the meaning of section 4(1)(h) of the Code of Criminal Procedure that is the complain  given under the section excluded the report of a  police officer.<br/><br/>It appears from the F.I.R as well as the P.W.1 the appellant has been arrested on the date of occurrence on 26.2.2007 without showing in connection of the case. For commission of the offence for dissimilarity of the accounts by seizing the currency and accounts books without giving him any opportunity to produce the same and then the F.I.R has been lodged on 26.3.2007 by getting permission from Bangladesh Bank on 25.3.2007 .<br/><br/>So, the lodgment of the F.I.R by the sub inspector of police Md. Mizanur Rahman ,submission of charge  sheet dated 1.6.2007 by S.I. Mohammad Shahid Uddin and cognizance taken by the tribunal and therefore framing of charge by the said tribunal against the appellant in the present case be contrary to and in violation of requirements of section 23(2) and (3) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. are bad in law.<br/><br/>From the scheme of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 can be said that the legislature wanted that any person accused of any offence for contravention of the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, etcetna should not be subjected to unnecessary harassment by the police and accordingly safe guard are provided in the act. But in the present case the police officer along with the combined force has in contravention of the safe guard provided in section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 initiated the present criminal case against the appellant by lodging the F.I.R treating the alleged offence under the said act. Neither getting any letter of authority nor it has been lodged by the Bangladesh Bank. Though a permission has been given by the Bangladesh Bank about one month later from the date of occurrence  as well as arrest of the appellant and on consideration  the evidence  of P.W. 18 who issued letter  of permission  ext. 7 after 1 month without  any reasons  thus a suggestion was given from the defence as mechanical  permission  so the FIR. itself is a malafide one  under the facts and circumstances of the case.<br/><br/>Under the above facts and circumstances, of the present case, the lodgment of the F.I.R can not be construed to have accorded the requisite authority to the informant to lodged the present criminal case against the appellant under the Foreign Exchange Regulation. So the initiation of the present case have not been validly initiated in terms of the requirements of Section 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act.<br/><br/>Moreover , it is admitted facts that the appellant is a bonafide business man and he is the proprietor of Jahan’s Money Exchange  which is also admitted by the P.W-11 A.K.M Fazlul Hoque, Assistant Director of Bangladesh Bank, Sylhet, in his evidence and he has also admitted that the appellant got the license on 19.10.1998 and he used to run his business regularly since then and  the said license was valid up to 18.10.2007 and the said money exchange enlisted to hold $ 25,000 dollars and we have also perused  the examination of the appellant under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure along with the papers and documents submitted by the appellant including his license where and account has been shown in respect of  US dollars 4755 by endorsing the photocopy of passport of different passengers an also accounts of $ 5476.85 from 12.02.2007 to 26.2.2007 along with the endorsement certificate and relevant photocopy of passport . We also considered the statement of D.W. 1 Md. Abu Bakkar Siddiqaue, Assistant Managing Director, Sonali Bank, Sonamgonj while he was performed as Assistant General Manager, Sonali Bank Darga Gate Branch, Sylhet on 19.2.2007 the appellant sold out 75135 pound and subsequently on scrutiny 2350 pound was found as torned and defective and that is why it was refunded to the appellant which is corroborated by D.W. 2 and it is also in the materials on record that the Bangladeshi taka which were seized from of the appellant the amount were drawn and deposited as business capital for foreign currency and it is for running his bonabide business and which does not constituted any offence of the said act. We find defense plea more probably then that of prosecution story and under above facts and circumstances and materials on record we find substances in the submission of the learned advocate for the appellant and therefore the appeal is succeeded.<br/><br/>The appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment and order dated 08..08.2007 passed by the Judge, Foreign Exchange Regulations Tribunal and Additional Sessions Judge , 1st Court, Sylhet in Foreign Exchange Regulation  Case No. 3 of 2007  is hereby set-aside and we directed the respondent to release the confiscated US $ 4745, &amp; Pounds 5476.85 Pounds and Tk. 27,80,222 at once in favour of the appellant and the appellant is also released from the surety of his bail bond.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

No explanation was made by the appellant neither in the cross examination nor in the examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the absence of any explanation which is required under section 106 of the Evidence Act, it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing the death of his wife. . . .

He denied the suggestion that the surat hal report and his post mortem Report are inconsistent with the description of the dead body and he denied the suggestion that he deposed falsely. <br/>These are the statements made by the prosecution witnesses.<br/><br/>Now let us analyse the deposition made by the defence witnesses.<br/>D.W. 1 Sultan Bepari, in his examination in chief stated that he knows the accused Mofiz as his neighbour. He also knows the victim Baby Akhter and he also stated that after marriage the accused Mofiz went to Saudi Arabia for service and he also stated that from there money was sent to the name of his wife Baby Akhter and in the name of his vira Joynal Abedin and that money was misappropriated by them.

He also stated that Baby dead before 2 years back he could not say how to met her death. He did not hear that Mofiz killed his wife Baby Akhter by strangulation. Accused Mofiz is a good boy. There is a minor son of Mofiz and Baby Akhter. He also stated that the date of occurrence at night he found that the accused Mofiz was beaten by his brother in law, vira and others.<br/><br/>In his cross examination he stated that his house is 3 kani distance from the house of Mofiz and there is no home between these house and at about 12/12.30 at night the brother in law of Mofiz shouted that his sister was killed and he also stated that there was a case for his misappropriate of money against Baby and vira of Mofiz he also stated that he saw the dead body of Baby in the house of Mofiz on the date of occurrence.

About 2 years before at night about 1 and  A.M. after hearing hue and cry he went to the house of the accused Mofiz and he found the accused was confined and the brother in law of accused Mofiz and his vira were beaten to the accused. He also stated that accused Mofiz used to serve at Saudi Arabia from where he sent  money to his wife Baby Akhter and vira Joynal Abedin and he also heard that money was not given to his father. He did not say how Baby dead. He also stated that the character of Baby was not good. He also stated that the minor boy of Mofiz who is now residing with his grand father.<br/><br/>In his cross examination he stated that he did not know how the victim Baby died and he also did not say who killed her and he also stated that he deposed by hearing the said fact. He also stated that he saw the dead body of the wife of accused in the house of the accused situated at the north vity. He denied the suggestion that due to save the accused he deposed falsely. <br/><br/>It appears that the charge was framed against the accused Appellant by the Trial Court to the effect that<br/>আপনি আসামী ১৫.০৪.২০০৬ ইং তারিখ রাত ১.৩০ ঘটিকায় সময় মতলব থানাধীন ভেংগুরভিটি গ্রামাস্থ আপনি আসামীর বসত বাড়ীর বসত ঘরে আপনার স্ত্রী ভিকটিম বেবী আকতারকে মুখ মন্ডল মাটিতে চাপিয়া ধরিয়া গলা টিপিয়া হত্যা করেন।<br/><br/>To prove the said charge prosecution examined as many as 11 (eleven) witnesses out of which P.W.2 is the informant and brother of the victim Baby Akter who deposed that immediately after occurrence he came to the place of occurrence and found the dead body of his sister laying in the house of the accused and also found blood on the nose and eyes and mud on the face of her dead body. The accused made extrajudicial Confession for committing the offence of killing the victim. He found the accused in his house and these materials facts also corroborated by the other P.Ws 1, 3 to 8 in their evidences who are private witnesses who went to the place of occurrence immediately after occurrence although the said prosecution witnesses were neighbore and relatives of the informant as well as deceased baby Akter. Their evidence shows as practical and usual instead of mechanical and considering their evidences along with the evidence of P.W.9 investigating officer who proved the sketch map showing place of occurrence without any denial from the defence as mentioned above at the house of the accused. P.W.1 to 8 categorically stated that they found the dead body of Baby Akter on the floor of the house of the accused person and these material facts also admitted by D.W.1 and D.W.2 and therefore it is well proved that the occurrence took place in the house of the accused as well as in the custody of her husband, Accused Appellant on the said date and time of occurrence.<br/><br/>It further appears that the P.W.9 the investigating officer held surathal on the next morning of the occurrence and found  to the effect that “ইহাতে সন্দেহ হয় যে, ভিকটিম বেবী আক্তারের স্বামী মফিজউদ্দিন তাহার আরও সহযোগী সহ রাত্রির যে কোন সময় বেবী আক্তারকে বালুর মধ্যে মুখ মন্ডল চাপিয়া ধরিয়া হত্যা করিয়া থাকিতে পারে’’<br/><br/>and on the said date post Mortem held by the Doctor P.W.11 found the injuries on the face and cyanosed up to chest wall with presence of mud and dust on the face and nostrils and found injury at the right side of the face and opined that death was due to asphyxia resulting from combined effect of strangulation as well as suffocation which was antimortem and homicidal in nature and the evidence of P.W.11 Dr. who held post mortem was not shifted by cross examination in any manner.  Considering the surathal Report of the victim post Mortem report along with the depositions of prosecution witnesses we find  consistency to prove the charge of killing the victim Baby Akter by her husband the accused appellant while she was in the custody of the Appellant as in the time and place at the residence of Appellant by strangulation and suffocation by her husband the Appellant. It also appears that the accused was arrested immediately after occurrence from his house by the police of concern police station P.W.9 and he made a confession on the next day before the Magistrate 1st class who recorded the confessional statements as per Law and Rules by P.W.10 and that  confessional statement of the appellant was proved .<br/><br/>After analysis the evidence set out above it appears that the prosecution has satisfactorily proved that the victim Baby Akhter died as a result of strangulation on the date, time and the place as alleged by the prosecution. Such evidence has been furnished by almost all the witnesses including P.W. 11 the doctor who conducted the post mortem examination on the person of the deceased. Death in his opinion, was due to asphyxia resulting from combined effect of strangulation as well as suffocation which was antimortem and homicidal in nature. In his opinion it is consisted with the description of the injury and inquest report ext. 3. We, therefore, find that the victim Baby Akhter died due to strangulation.  As to the responsibility for causing the murder there is no direct evidence of the occurrence. The prosecution sought to prove the charge on certain circumstantial facts as well as the confessional statement of the appellant Ext. 6 Admittedly the appellant and the victim Baby Akhter were husband and wife. The evidence of PWs. 1,2,5,7 and 8 disclosed that the victim met her death while she was living with her husband in the same house of the accused. It was also appears that the dead body of the victim was found in the house of the appellant as disclosed by the P.Ws. 1-8 and this material facts also admitted by the witnesses of the accused D.W.1 and D.W.2  and said witnesses also deposed that the accused was present there. The death of the wife being caused by strangulation as already found by us, it was quite natural for the husband to send an information to the Police station. The accused did not take any step to that aspect. On the other hand, it appears that immediate after the occurrence  while P.Ws. 2,5,6,7 and 8 went to the house of the place of occurrence at that time the accused disclosed that he committed the murder of his wife Baby and similarly the accused  made confession in presence of  P.Ws. 1, 3 and 4 by sitting at the police station that he committed murder of the victim by strangula-tion and the evidences of D.W. 1 disclosed that he saw the dead body of the victim Baby on the night and D.W.2 also admitted during existence the relationship as husband and wife the dead body of victim Baby found in the house of the accused Mofiz. So we find the murder of the victim Baby Akhter took place while the accused appellant remained as husband wife with the victim and was in the same house and that house owned by the accused Mofiz. Ordinarily an accused has no obligation to account for the death for which he is placed on trial. It appears that as the murder of the wife Baby took place in the custody of her husband appellant in the same house. Then the appellant was under an obligation to explain how his wife had met with her death. No explanation was made by the appellant neither in the cross examination nor in the examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the absence of any explanation which is required under section 100 of the Evidence Act. Thus it seems none other than the husband was responsible for causing the death of Baby Akhter. In addition to the said circumstantial facts there is the confessional statement of the accused appellant marked as Ext. 7. The said statement has been quoted as under:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“আমার নাম মফিজ উদ্দিন মফিজ। আমিসৌদি আরবে ছিলাম। দেড়/ দুই মাস আগেদেশে ফিরি । গত ১৪/৪/২০০৬ তাং রাত ১/৩০ ঘটিকায় আমার স্ত্রীর সাথে টাকা পয়াস নিয়ে কথা কাটাকাটি হয় । এক পর্যায়ে আমি তাকে থাপ্পর মারি। সে আমার নিম্মাংগে চাপ দিয়ে ধরে। আমি তাকে গলায় চেপে মাটিতে চাপ দিয়ে ধরি। আমি ভাবি নাই সে মারা যাবে|”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It was recorded by P.W.10 the Magistrate 1<sup>st</sup> Class at that relevant time. The confessional statement appears to have been made in the prescribed form. The Magistrate stated that he recorded the said statement after observing all the legal formalities in recording as required under law and gave 3 hours time to the maker of the statement for his reflection. It also transpires from Ext. 6 that the maker of the statement was placed in charge of a peon in his chamber and there was no police. He explained to the confessing person that he was not bound to make the confession and if he does so that may be used against him. This P.W. also said that the confessional statement of the appellant appeared to him to be voluntary and true and he read it over to the accused who put his signature admitting that it had been correctly recorded and he also stated that in course of recording he did not see any injury on the body of the accused and the accused also did not state any allegation of torture to him and the incurable confession was made at the first instance while appears before the Magistrate without taking him any remand for the said confession Ext. 7 is very much consistent with her surathal report and post Mortem report. That the confessional statement in the earliest point of time, corroborated in respect of  place, time and manner of occurrence so confession was also proved as voluntary and true, though subsequently the appellant filed an application for retraction of his confession. In his application he stated that due to fear and torture he made confession. On the other hand P.W. 10 Magistrate who recorded the said statement who was not suggested to that effect by the defence and in such situation the defence can not be curable. We considered the confessional statement itself as it appears that the confessional statement made voluntarily. We also considered the contention of the confession it shows that there was a altercation regarding monetary transaction between husband and wife and the monetary transaction is supported and corroborated by PW 2 the informant and other pws 3 to 8. and as well as D.W 1 and 2 and altercation took place between husband and wife in the night at the date of occurrence in the residence of the accused and gave fist thump blow subsequently the victim caught hold the lower part of the accused and then he strangulated her throat and he also stated that he did not think over that his wife would met her death. This confession shows that even no deadly weapon has been used no prior intention to kill his wife Baby Akter is available in the facts of the case and there was no pre-medition to kill the victim. The killing took place through altercation due to monetary transaction between husband and wife and also from sudden fight between husband and wife and in such facts and circumstance as discussion above we find that the accused Appellant had no prior intention to kill his wife Baby Akter and there was no pre-medition to kill the victim even no deadly weapon has been used for causing grievous injury upon the victim. It is also noticed that immediately after occurrence the mother of the appellant informed the sister in Law of the victim P.W.5 jaynal Abadin and the Appellant was all along with the dead body till his arrest and he made confession instead to make any attempt to concealment the dead body as well as concealment to himself by making absconding or otherwise move over to some other place. Admittedly they have a child of 5 years. In view of the facts and attending circumstances of the case, we find that it was not a cool headed and premeditated murder, rather the fact of the case as disclosed that the incident took place out of altercation due to monitory transaction which has taken into such circumstances to commit the alleged offence of murder. When intention to kill is Lacking and therefore it is not a culpable homicide amounting to murder and hence alleged offence of murder does not fall within the provision of section 302 of the Penal Code rather the alleged offence comes under the provision of section 304 part II of the penal code.<br/><br/>In the result the appeal is dismissed by altering the conviction and sentence to the effect that the accused Appellant Md. Mofiz Uddin @ Mofiz is convicted under section 304 part II of the penal code and sentencing him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10(ten) years only instead of section 302 of the Penal Code.<br/><br/>Send down the lower court records at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Case No.2599 of 2008 punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 pending in the Court of Joint Metropolitan Sessions Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, Metropolitan Sessions Case No. 401 of 2009 arising out of C.R. Case No.2504 of 2009 punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act,1881 pending in the Court of 2<sup>nd</sup> Joint Metropolitan Sessions Judge,  Dhaka, Metropolitan Sessions Case No.3167 of 2008 arising out of C.R. Case No.2790 of 2008 punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 pending in the Court of  Joint Metropolitan Sessions Judge, 6<sup>th</sup> Court,  Dhaka, Metropolitan Sessions Case No.376 of 2009 arising out of C.R. Case No.2281 of 2008 punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 pending in the Court of 5<sup>th</sup>  Joint Metropolitan Sessions Judge,  Dhaka shall not be quashed and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/><br/>In short, the case of the prosecution for the purpose of disposal of the Rules is as follows:<br/>One Khan Mohammad Raqib Hossain, Executive Officer of  the Export Import Bank of Bangladesh, Nawabpur Branch, Dhaka filed a complaint-petition in the respective C.R. cases, referred to above, stating that accused-petitioner took loan from the Bank under different sanction letter order mentioned in the compliant-petition with a commitment to repay by sixty consecutive installments  and in order to repay the loan account payee cheques were issued but ultimately all those cheques, referred in the compliant-petition, are found to have been bounced for insufficient fund. As a result, the complainant-petitioner issued a notice under section 138(1)(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act but the accused-petitioner did not respond for which having no other alternative the complainant-opposite-party filed all these C.R. cases in order to secure the trial of the accused-petitioner for committing the offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.<br/><br/>On recording the initial statement of the complainant under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and issued the process to secure the attendance of the accused-petitioner to face trial. Ultimately accused-petitioner made his appearance in all those cases, referred to above, and obtained bail, and filed all the Miscella-neous cases under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure alleging that the case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 is not, at all, maintainable because “cross-cheque” or “account payee” cheque as has been mentioned in the Compliant-Petition  does not come within the scope of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 because in no way cross-cheque preserves the power of negotiability. Moreover, section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 does not allow anyone to prosecute unless the cheque is received by the Bank, submitted by another person. On such counts Rule of these matters as has been so issued are to be made absolute.<br/><br/>Mr. K.B. Rumy the learned Advocate for the accused-petitioner, at the very outset of the submission, has drawn our attention in the provision laid down in section 123A of the Negotiable Instruments Act which has been placed in Chapter 14 of the said Act in the name and style of the special provision relating to cheque where cheque crossed or account-payee cheque shall be ceased to be a Negotiable Instrument in the language employed in section 123A,(2)(a) of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881; as such the same cannot be brought within the mischief of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881.<br/><br/>Moreover, Mr. Rumy has also pointed out that to bring the matter within the purview of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act there must be an existence of a 3<sup>rd</sup> person to whom cheque is to be issued for encashment where it is to bounced for insufficient fund or it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that Bank; but in the instant case there is no such person as drawee who has been denied to encash the amount mentioned in the cheque. So no criminal proceeding under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act can be allowed to continue causing unnecessary harassment of the accused-petitioner.<br/><br/>Mr. Zahirul Hoque Zahir, the learned Deputy Attorney-General appearing on behalf of the opposite-party No.2 has strongly opposed the Rule alleging, inter alia, that the subject matter of a criminal proceeding under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is “any cheque” which has been defined in section 6 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Moreover, since “account payee cheque” is also a cheque within the meaning of section 6 and does not change its character as negotiable instrument the same cannot be kept out of the ambit of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In fact, section 123A(2)(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act put restriction in order to encash the amount mentioned in the cheque because such change will simply make it not negotiable but does not make it ousted from the character of Negotiable Instrument. In support of his contention the learned Deputy Attorney General has brought to our notice in the provisions laid down in section 13, 123A(2)(b) and section 126 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Moreover, the words “any cheque” as has been employed in section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 clearly bring the cheque whether it is a “bearer” or “account payee” within the mischief of section 138. In no way, it can be regulated by section 123A(2)(a) rather, such “account payee” cheque is to be regulated by both subsection (2)(a) and (b) of section 123A of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Moreover, the word “any person” appearing in section 138 is nothing but a person who received the cheque from the drawer for encashment. In the instant case Bank as a lender received the “cheque” from the borrower, the present accused-petitioner, and presented it for encashment to the Bank where the accused petitioner is maintaining his account but such impugned cheques are found to have been bounced and returned to the “drawer” for insufficient fund. So, the Bank has got two status which is enough to refute the contention of the learned Advocate for the accused-petitioner.<br/><br/>Mr. Kazi Nurul Amin the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Complainant-Opposite-Party No.1 has adopted the argument placed by the learned Deputy Attorney-General for Opposite-party No.2. Mr. Amin further submits that the “account payee cheque” is no doubt a cheque as defined in section 6 read with section 126 and 123A of the Negotiable Instruments Act where the mode of collection of money mentioned in the cheque has been properly described. The provision laid down in section 123(2)(a) cannot be read or taken into consideration in an isolated manner rather the provision laid down in clause (b) is to be taken into consideration for the purpose of collection of money mentioned in the cheque. Mr. Amin further argues that section 123(2) is nothing but a procedural one given by the legislature placing in the specific provision in Chapter XIV affording a guideline how to encash the amount mentioned in the “account payee cheque” which has been ceased it’s simple “negotiable character” but never allowed to be considered as a negotiable instrument, defined in section 13 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881.<br/>Let us quote the provision laid down in section 123A &amp; 126 of the Negotiable Instrument Act since the impugned cheque is admittedly “account payee” one:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>123A. Cheque crossed “account payee-</strong> “ (1) Where a cheque crossed generally bears across its face an addition of the words “account payee” between the two parallel transverse lines constituting the general crossing, the cheque, besides being crossed generally, is said to be crossed “account payee.”<br/>(2) when a cheque is crossed “account payee”<br/>(a) it shall cease to be negotiable; and<br/>(b) it shall be the duty of the banker collecting payment of the cheque to credit the proceeds there of only to the account of the payee named in the cheque.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This section is also to be read with section 126 placed in same Chapter XIV of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<strong>Section 126</strong>. <strong>Payment of cheque crossed generally-</strong> Where a cheque is crossed generally, the banker on whom it is drawn shall not pay it otherwise than to a banker.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>On meticulous examination of these two provisions laid down in section 123A &amp; 126 read with the definition of the “cheque” given in section 6 it has become clear to us that cross-cheque/Account Payee cheque is also cheque as contemplated in section 138(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act but only changes its normal character by ceasing its negotiability but it does not lose its character as negotiable instrument as defined in section 13 of the Act. In fact, section 123A (1)(a) is to be read with clause (b) of  the same section which have already quoted. The provisions laid down in clause (b) of section 123A(1) clearly gives the way how to encash amount mentioned in the “account payee” cheque. In addition to that provision we are also the follow the provision of section 126 of the said Act.<br/><br/>We are to remember that the principal object of interpretation is not only to find out a particular meaning of a word or words in a statute, but to find out the intention of the legislature which has been expressed through the medium of words. To interpret is not to restrict or to expand the meaning of the statute which, in truth, it intends to convey. So every effort is necessary to make a statute workable and not to render it ineffective by giving a meaningless interpretation. It is an elementary rule of construction that the intention of the legislature must be sought from the statute taken as a whole. In arriving at the true meaning of any particular phrase or words employed in the statute it must not be viewed isolated from the context, it must be viewed in its whole context, the title, the preamble, and all other related parts of the statute.<br/><br/>Keeping the above view in mind we are to say that the clause (a) of section 123A(2) is absolutely dependent on clause (b) when the cheque is the “account payee” one since in clause (a) only word “negotiable” has been used not the words “Negotiable Instruments” as defined in section 13 of the Act, 1881.<br/><br/>In the light of the above observation we are of the opinion that since the “account payee cheque” mentioned in the complaint-petition has not lost it’s character as negotiable instrument, the same can be easily brought within the mischief of <em>“any cheque” </em>mentioned in section 138(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act because cheque includes “account payee cheque” also. So we find no substance in the contention of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.<br/><br/>Now let us see whether the Bank being Complainant can have any right to file a case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in absence of “any person” appearing in section 138(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act.<br/><br/>Let us quote the provision laid down in section 138(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>138. Dishonour of cheque for insuff-iciency, etc. of funds in the account</strong>-“ (1) Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account  is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to the amount of the cheque, or with both.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>We have already discussed that the complainant Bank is the “drawee” of the cheque whereas accused petitioner is the “drawer”. Admittedly complainant petitioner as a “drawee” submitted the impugned “account payee cheque” in the Bank where the accused-petitioner has been maintaining his account but the same has been bounced for want of sufficient fund. In such circumstance we find nothing which will not go to fulfill the requirements of law as contemplated in section 138(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.<br/><br/>In fact, when the cheque is returned to drawer by the Bank for insufficient fund certainly it comes within the mischief of section 138(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act since other mandatory provisions are found to have been complied with. To have the above views we may also safely rely upon the decision of an unreported case of Arifuzzaman –VS- State and another, passed in a criminal petition for leave to appeal No. 514 of 2010 of the Appellate Division of Supreme Court of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>In the light of the above findings we are of the opinion that there is no merit in these Rules and accordingly all these rules are to be discharged.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rules are discharged.<br/><br/>The order of stay passed at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>Let a copy of the judgment and order be annexed with all the Criminal Miscellaneous Case mentioned above and sent to the court below at once for information and necessary action.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Abu Tariq, J: </u></strong><br/> <br/>This civil revision arises out of the order dated 05.09.2000 passed by the learned Sub-ordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka passed in Miscellaneous Case No. 725 of 1989 arising out of Title Suit No. 17 of 1975.<br/><br/>Short facts for disposal of the Rule is that the predecessor of the present petitioner Nos. 1 (a)-1 (g) filed Miscellaneous Case No. 725 of 1989 on 04-08-1989 before the learned Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka under Section 4 of the Partition Act arising out of the original Title Suit No. 17 of 1975, filed by opposite party No. 1 for partition.<br/><br/>The Title Suit No. 17 of 1975 was decreed in preliminary form by the learned Subordinate Judge on 23.06.1979 and plaintiff opposite party No. 1, got saham in respect of .11 acre of land and Advocate commissioner was appointed on 05-09-1979. Against the said decree dated 23-06-1979, the defendant-petitioner preferred First Appeal No. 01 of 1980 and the High Court Division affirmed the preliminary decree on 22-03-1984 with modification that the plaintiff-opposite party No,1 would get a saham of .1062½ acre of land instead of .11 acre and in Civil Appeal No. 02 of 1985 challenging the judgment in F. A. the  Appellate Division affirmed the judgment and decree of the Honourable High Court Division. <br/><br/>While the position was such the instant Miscellaneous Case No. 725 of 1989 was filed stating, inter alia, that the predecessor of the petitioners, named, Waliullah and the opposite party Nos. 2-8 of the original application are members of the dwelling house of the joint undivided family. The present opposite party No. 1 has constructed a one storied building at the east side of the suit plot and the building at the east side of the suit plot and the building is a commercial concerned and a restaurant. The petitioner also made other 11 semi-pacca rooms which were let out to different commercial units including, SWASH Corporation and Abul Watch. The opposite party Nos. 3-8 of the original application have constructed semi-pacca homestead at the adjacent to Sadar Road which were let out to Defendant Nos. 7 to 17 of the original Title Suit No. 17 of 1975. The opposite party No. 1 claims that he has purchased about .11 acre of land from opposite party No. 2 by two documents dated 25.02.1974 and 05.02.1974 and opposite party No. 1 had no construction in his purchased land in the suit plot. In the suit plot No. 1162 there were 4 semi-pacca rooms up to 1966 and after 1966 the petitioner constructed buildings at his own cost having approved plan from D.I.T. The opposite party No. 1 is a stranger purchaser and not a member of the undivided family. The possession of opposite party No. 1 would be a threat to the privacy of the members of the family in respect of their prestige, life, privacy, pardah and peaceful possession. In order to prevent the unexpected illegal trespass of opposite party No. 1 the petitioner filed the instant case under Section 4 of the Partition Act.<br/><br/>The opposite party No. 1 contested the case by filing a written objection denying all material allegation made in the application contending, inter alia, that the petitioner to delay and frustrate the decree upheld upto the Appellate Division filed the instant case. The instant case is not maintainable without a specific undivided family dwelling house. The suit land earlier was vacant land in which later on many constructions were made and gradually became a commercial area. Admittedly the said area is a commercial and not dwelling but and has been let out to different persons including Defendants 7-17 of the original suit. The petitioner himself has also started a hotel business in the name of ‘Aloka Hotel.’ The original partition suit was long ago decreed on 23-06-1979 which was affirmed by the Hon’ble Appellate Division.   The opposite party never intended to harass any member of the family of the petitioner. The suit land is not a dwelling house rather it is a commercial area which is let out to different persons and it also includes hotel and there is no legal reason to claim the commercial area as a dwelling house belonging to the members of an undivided family. The opposite party No.1 has got a shop and show room in a part of suit and also let out some rooms to the tenants. The case being false is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>The learned trial court framed 2(two) issues as to whether the petitioner is entitled to get the disputed land under Section 4 of the Partition Act and whether the prayer of  the petitioner can be allowed.<br/><br/>In course of trial the petitioner examined 3(three) witnesses and opposite party No 1 examined 1 witness to prove their respective cases.<br/><br/>The learned trial Court upon perusal of the pleadings, hearing the parties and considering the evidence dismissed the case by order dated 05-09-2000.<br/><br/>The learned trial court found that the suit land adjoining to North-South Road is a commercial area and there is no reason to apprehend about destruction in privacy and pardah of the family members of the petitioner specially when there is a restaurant conducted by the son of the petitioner and there is no legal reason to invoke Section 4 of the Act in the given circumstances.<br/><br/>However, several facts and litigation were there and ultimately, the learned Sub-ordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka rejected the prayer under Section 4 of the Partition Act holding that;</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"উপরোওু উভয় পক্ষদয় ও দালিলিক স্বাক্ষ্য পর্যালোচনা করিলে  দেখা যায় ১নং প্রতিপক্ষ দরখাসতকারীর ভাইয়ের নিকট হইতে এুয় করিয়া মালিক দখলকার হইয়া বাটোয়ারা মোকদ্দমা দায়ের করিয়া ডিএিু প্রাপ্ত হয়। যাহা পরবর্তীতে সর্বোচ্চ আদালত মহামান্য সুপ্রীমকোর্ট পর্যমত বহাল থাকে। দরখাসতকারী ১নং প্রতিপক্ষ আদালতে বহালকৃত রায় এর সুফল হইতে বচ্ঞিত করার জন্যই মূলতঃ অত্র মোকদ্দমা দায়ের করিয়াছেন। ড~ভয় পক্ষের স্বাক্ষ্যে এবং নালিশী ভূমির অবসহা বিচার বিশ্লেষন করিলে  দেখায় যায় নর্থ সাইথ  রোড সংলগ্ণ যাহা বানিজ্যিক এলাকা হিসাবে ধরিয়া লওয়া যায়। এখানে ১নং প্রতিপক্ষ তাহার ডিএিুকৃত সম্পত্তিতে থাকা অবসহায় করিলে দরখাসতকারী বা তাহার সমতানাদিদের পর্দার ক্ষতি হওয়ায়  কোন কারন নাই। দরখাসতকারীর  ছেলেই একটি রেষ্টুরেন্ট করিয়াছেন।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>As against the same, the petitioner preferred the instant revisional application and obtained the  Rule on 14-12-2000.<br/><br/>It is to be noted Syed Mohammad Monirullah. son of Alhaj Syed Tofazzal Ahmed of 155/A Madrasa Bhaban, Hazari Lane, Chittagong-4000 at present 8/2-1 Purana Paltan Syed Nazrul Islam Sharani as applicant filed an application for leave to proceed with the revision in place of opposite party No.3 Shamim Akter alias Rosy under Order 22, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure stating, that he has purchased the share of opposite party No.3 by a registered deed No. 3669 dated 18-07-2005 and thus she exhausted her share and since she has no subsisting interest and her share devolved upon the application who got right, title and interest on that from 18-07-2005 and for ends of justice be allowed to take legal steps.<br/><br/>Perused the application filed by Syed Mohammad Monirullah, the representative of the opposite party No.3 Sharmim Akter @ Rosy praying for leave to proceed with this revision on behalf of the opposite party No. 3. Heard the learned Advocate for the applicant, no objection raised by any party and for end of justice I am inclined to allow the application of the applicant to represent the opposite party No. 3 as prayed for.<br/>Accordingly, application to represent the opposite party No. 3 by applicant is allowed.<br/><br/>Pursuant to the service of the Rule the learned Advocate Mr. Mahbubey Alam and Mr. Md. Mozammel Hossain entered appearance on behalf of the opposite party while the learned Advocate Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali appearing on behalf of the petitioner.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the learned trial court committed an error of law resulting in an error in such order occasioning failure of justice in dismissing the Miscellaneous Case No. 725 of 1989 upon misreading and Non-consideration of material evidence on record. The share of the dwelling house belonging to an undivided family of the petitioner since being transferred to the opposite party No. 1, who is none but a stranger-purchaser only. It was the duty of the court to allow the case filed under Section 4 of the partition Act to protect the family from the unexpected entry and possession of the opposite party No.1. as the land was sold to stranger purchaser opposite party No.1, the dwelling house is owned by an undivided family and the petitioner undertakes to buy the share sold to opposite party No.1 but the learned court below failed to appreciate this aspect of the case and wrongly dismissed the same thus the Rule may be made absolute.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate on behalf of opposite party No.1 submits that the learned trial court upon proper perusal of the pleadings as well as appreciation of evidence, particularly PW-3 and the application rightly dismissed the case since the material ingredient that the subject-matter must be a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family is unfounded in the pleading and evidence. The learned court below committed no error of law occasioning failure of justice in dismissing the case. The petitioner failed to prove that suit property is an undivided homestead, in the application it is asserted that there is homestead and also commercial installation in the circumstances the application under Section 4 is misconceived and a device to delay the decree in  partition.<br/><br/>He further submits that the pleadings and evidence show that there is no existence of any joint undivided family to construe the case of dwelling house within the meaning of Section 4 of the Partition Act. In paragraph 3 and 5 of the original application the petitioner himself admitted that the opposite party No.1 has got no construction in the suit plot thus it transpires that the land purchased by opposite party No. 1 was never part of the dwelling house as claimed by the petitioner and it has not been proved that the transferred land forms part of the homestead and no attempt was made to prove the same nor Abidullah was claimed to be a member of alleged joint family.<br/><br/>He further submits that the original application does Not disclose definite identification of the dwelling house as to the quantum of land covering such dwelling house appertained to such plot and khatian number in order to make the distinction as to whether the land sold by opposite party No.2 opposite party No.1 is how and if connected to the dwelling house specially when it is admitted in the application and evidence that there are many shops let out to different tenants. The petitioner maintains Aloka Hotel and the son of the petitioners is conducting a restaurant and it is not the case of the petitioner that the suit plot only contains a dwelling house.<br/><br/>He lastly submits that according to Section 4 of the Partition Act the most essential condition among the 4 conditions that there must be a dwelling house and the same shall belong to an a dwelling house and the same shall belong to an undivided family since having not been proved and unfounded in evidence the application in the present case under Section 4 does not lie and must fail.<br/><br/>Heard the learned advocates, perused the findings of the impugned order, pleadings and evidence and other materials on record.<br/><br/>It appears that Section 4 of the Partition Act was enacted to afford a special opportunity to a co-sharer of an undivided homestead or dwelling house against a stranger purchaser for buying up his share through the Court. The object of this legislation is to preserve the sanctity of an undivided dwelling house against the intrusion of a stranger on the basis of purchase of a portion of such a dwelling house from a co-sharer or some of the co-sharers. This was obliviously to safeguard the interest of the existing co-sharer, co-sharers against forcing entry into an undivided dwelling house by a stranger by providing an opportunity to buy up the share purchased by a stranger thereto. This is indeed a beneficial legislation for the co-owners of an undivided homestead or dwelling house against the onslaught of an outsider.<br/><br/>The object of this legislation is reasonable and it is quite consonance with the principle of equity, justice and good conscience. Since in the instant case the plaintiff petitioners opted to purchase the share of the purchaser in the undivided homestead in question immediately after the purchase of the same by the stranger defendant, we are of the view that the proper question to determine whether the property is dwelling hut or not when the petitioner plaintiff ostensibly opted to buy up the share of the stranger purchaser in the undivided dwelling house but it-appears that the property in question is not a dwelling house belonging to on undivided family. This principle of law enunciated by their Lordships in  the case of Sayesta Bibi –versus Juma Sha reported in 42 DLR (AD) 53 fully applies to the facts and circumstance of the present case and we are bound to be in respectful agreement with the view taken therein.<br/><br/>Proper safeguard have been provided for the exercise of the statutory discretion. The partition Act also confers the valuable right of the pre-emption on a co-sharers. Besides, under its provisions, a stranger who has purchased a share in an unclaimed dwelling house and seeks partition, can be compelled to sell his share to the members of the family who are the owners of the rest of the house, and this prevents the instruction of the stranger into the circle of the co-owners and thus preserves the santity of the family dwelling house.<br/><br/>Relief under Section 4 of the Partition Act is available to an original co-sharers of the dwelling house of an undivided family as Sub-Section 1 of Section 4 runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Where a share of a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family has been transferred to a person who is Not a member of such family and such transferee sues for partition, the court shall, if any member of the family being a share-holder shall undertake to buy the share of such manner as it thinks fit an direct the sale of such share to such share-holder, and may give all necessary and proper directions in that behalf.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From reading of the above provision of law, the pleading and evidence of P. W. 1 it appears that defendant Nos. 2-17 of the original suit are admittedly the tenants under the petitioner and P. W. 2 stated that the suit land is situated adjacent to the pavement adjoined to North-South Road. P. W. 3 stated in chief that the petitioner lives in a separate building with his family. In paragraph 2 of the application it is disclosed that the suit land is not a dwelling house but includes many shops and restaurant.<br/><br/>Dwelling house in Section 4 includes the land and appurtenances which are ordinarily and reasonably necessary for its enjoyment and thus it includes garden, courtyard, orchard but a commercial public area can not become a part of the dwelling house, The expression “dwelling house belonging to an undivided family” appearing in Section 4 has been borrowed form Section 44 of the Transfer of Property Act and bears the same meaning, a commercial business place cannot be termed as a dwelling house under Section 4 of the Partition Act.<br/><br/>It is admitted and apparent on record that instant application under Section 4 of partition Act does not show any definite identification of the dwelling house that the same covers the specific area of the suit plot or khatian and from reading of the application it does not appear that a specific and definite case on dwelling house was either made out. On the other hand it discloses that there are many shops and restaurant in the suit plot and many of the co sharers have got no constant residing in the suit plot. In one hand the suit land is claimed to be a dwelling house and on the other hand it is claimed to be commercial property including restaurant and shops in occupation of tenants years after years and on such fact cannot invoke the said Section 4 of the Partition Act.<br/><br/>The learned trial court has arrived at a correct decision upon proper appreciation of pleading and evidence that the case of dwelling house is not proved in evidence and the property is a commercial one. Thus there is nothing to interfere with the impugned order.<br/><br/>I find no substance in the submission made by the learned advocate for the petitioners in this Rule. The learned trial Court committed no error of law occasioning failure of Justice in dismissing the case and the impugned order does not call for any interference. The learned advocate for the petitioner could not show any misreading and non-consideration of material evidence affecting the merit of the case.  Thus I find no merit in the Rule.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged without any order as to cost. Stay granted at the time of issuance of Rule stands vacated. Connected C. R. No. 1226 of 2000 and C. R. No. 4673 have already been disposed on 08.3.2003 and 13.3.2008 respectively.<br/><br/>The order dated 05-09-2000 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka passed in Miscellaneous Case No. 725 of 1989 is hereby affirmed.<br/><br/>Send down the lower Court’s record.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
