Rahman, Senior Advocate (Mrs. Sara Hossain, Advocate and Mr. A. B.M. Bayezid, Advocate with him) instructed by Mr. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><br/><strong>Respondents : </strong>Not presented.<br/><br/><strong><u>Civil Review Petition No. 76 of 2015</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><u>Syed Mahmud Hossain,</u></strong><strong><u> J</u></strong>:<br/><br/>This petition for review arises out of the judgment and order dated 05.05.2015 passed by this Division in Civil Appeal No. 116 of 2010 allowing the appeal in part and maintaining the death sentence against convict-appellant Shukur Ali.<br/><br/>The facts, leading to the filing of this petition for review, in brief, are:<br/><br/>          The prosecution case is that on 11.06.1999 Sumi Akter aged about 7 years, daughter of Md. Harun driver, was playing with one Sajib, P.W.10 on the varandah of their house while her mother Rahima Begum was sleeping in the house. At about 2.30 p.m. she woke up but failed to trace out the whereabouts of her daughter Sumi Akter. She along with P.W.6, Abdur Rouf, searched Sumi Akter from door to door and the house of the condemned prisoner Shukur Ali (hereinafer referred to as the petitioner) was found under lock and key. On search, the body of Sumi Akter was found inside the house, which was taken out of the house and the gold and silver ornaments which she was wearing were found missing. There were marks of injuries on her leg and also reddish liquid was found by the side of her genital organ. The petitioner was caught by the people from Tepra and was brought there who admitted in presence of witnesses to have raped and killed Sumi. On the basis of a First Information Report to that effect a case was started in Sibalaya Police Station.<br/>The petitioner was convicted by Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Adalat for sexually assaulting to death of Sumi Akter, a minor girl aged about 7 years. The Bishesh Adalat sentenced him to death. The High Court Division confirmed the death sentence and this Division also affirmed the death sentence. A review petition filed before this Division was also dismissed. After that, the petitioner along with another moved the High Court Division challenging the mandatory death penalty provided in section 6(2) of the Ain as ultra vires the Constitution.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the parties, the High Court Division declared section 6(2) of the Ain, 1995 ultra vires the Constitution but refrained from declaring section 34 of the Ain, 2000 unconstitutional and also did not declare the sentence of the petitioner to be unlawful. The High Court Division granted a certificate under section 103(2)(a) of the Constitution and as a result of which, Civil Appeal No. 116 of 2010 has been initiated.<br/><br/>By the judgment dated 05.05.2015, this Division declared sub-sections 2 and 4 of section 6 Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Bishesh Bidhan Ain, 1995, sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 34 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain, 2000 and section 303 of the Penal Code ultra vires the Constitution. This Division further has held that despite repeal of Ain of 1995, the pending cases and pending appeals in respect of those offences shall be tried and heard in accordance with the provision of the Ain,1995, but the sentences prescribed in respect of similar nature of offences of the Ain,2000 shall be applicable. This Division has further held that there shall be no mandatory sentence of death in respect of offence of murder committed by an offender who is under sentence of life imprisonment.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the petitioner was caught red-handed by the people of Tepra and was brought to the place of occurrence and before the witnesses. He admitted the incident of killing the victim. The victim Sumi Akter was only 7 years old. This Division found that the killing was brutal and diabolical and that there was no extenuating ground for commuting the sentence and accordingly his sentence was confirmed.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by the impugned judgment dated 05.05.2015, the petitioner filed this review petition before this Division.<br/><br/>Mr. M. K. Rahman, learned Senior Advocate (Ms. Sara Hossain, Advocate with him), appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that the petitioner was merely a boy of 14 years old at the time of occurrence and 16 years at time of trial and therefore, he was a minor and sub-sections (2) and (4) of section 6 of Ain, 1995 and sub-sections (2 and (3) of 34 of Ain, 2000 having been declared ultra vires the Constitution, the question of imposing death sentences prescribed in respect of those offences in the Ain, 2000 does not arise. He further submits that the petitioner was a minor boy and that there are mitigating circumstances which warrant conversion of death sentence to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Ms. Sara Hossain also tries to submit that the confession alleged to have been made by the petitioner was not true and voluntary and that it was obtained by torture.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of the review-petitioners, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/><br/>The learned Advocates have drawn our attention as regards the age of the petitioner at the time of commission of the offence as found by the High Court Division in Death Reference No. 29 of 2001 along with Jail Appeal No. 2882 of 2001. The High Court Division found that the petitioner was merely a boy of 14 old years at the time of occurrence and 16 years at the time of trial of the case and therefore, he was a minor. The High Court Division further found that since no alternative sentence has been provided for the offence, it was left with no other option but to maintain the sentence if it believed that the prosecution had been able to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt. The High Court Division observed that had the petitioner been tried for an offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code his sentence of death could have been commuted to imprisonment for life because of his tender age. The High Court Division observed that this was one of the extenuating circumstances for commuting his sentence. The High Court Division, however, hoped that it was a fit case, in which, the President of the Republic could consider the circumstances and commute the sentence in the light of the of the observation made by it provided the condemn-prisoner would make such a prayer.<br/><br/>In Jail Appeal No. 08 of 2004 arising out the judgment of the High Court Division, this Division held that the minimum sentence that could be given for committing an offence under section 6(2) of the Ain was death and death alone and as such, it was impossible to take a different view in the matter of sentence.<br/><br/>A review application was filed against the judgment delivered in Jail Appeal No. 08 of 2004 and this Division observed that the condemn-prisoner if so advised might seek mercy to the appropriate forum.  <br/><br/>Having gone through the judgment of the High Court Division in the death reference, we find that it could not convert the death sentence to imprisonment for life as section 6(2) of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 did not provide for any other sentence except death. The High Court Division was of the view that it was a fit case where the President of the Republic could consider the sentence and commute the sentence to imprisonment for life provided the petitioner would make such a prayer. In Jail Appeal No. 08 of 2004 arising out of the judgment of the High Court Division and this Division could not commute the death sentence as section 6(2) of the Ain did not permit as such.<br/><br/>From the judgment delivered by the High Court Division in the death reference, we find that the petitioner was aged about 14 years at the time of occurrence and 16 years at the time of the trial and that he was a minor.<br/><br/>In the case of <strong><em>Nalu vs. State, (2012)17 BLC (AD) 204</em></strong>, we have mentioned the grounds for which a death may be commuted to imprisonment for life. The mitigating circumstances mentioned in the above case are as follows:</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The condemned-prisoner has no significant history of prior criminal activity.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Youth of the condemned-prisoner at the time of commission of the offence.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The condemned-prisoner would not be likely to commit acts of violence if released.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Confinement of the condemned-prisoner in the condemned cell from 09.06.2005 till date i.e. for more than 7 years during which period the sword of death has been hanging on his head.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case in hand, we find that the petitioner has no significant history of prior criminal activity and that he was aged 14 years at the time of commission of the offence and 16 years at the time of framing of charge. The petitioner has been in the condemned cell since 12.07.2001, that is, more than 14 years. Considering all aspects of the case, we are of the view that the death sentence of the petitioner be commuted to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/>Accordingly, this review petition is disposed of. The sentence of death imposed upon the petitioner is commuted to imprisonment for life.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

After his expiry daughter Arafatunnessa, defendant no.1, inherited 1/5 of his property and rest of the property inherited by defendant nos. 2-12; During possession, Arafatunnessa transferred her share in favour of her youngest son, the plaintiff, vide registered Heba-bil-Ewaj dated 22.04.1974; Since then plaintiff has been possessing ‘kha’ schedule land on payment of rents and taxes to the Government exchequer; plaintiff is in ejmali possession of the land with defendants; Plaintiff or her mother never transferred any land in favour of any one; Suit land is not partitioned by metes and bounds; Plaintiff requested defendants for partition of the land but defendants did not pay heed and ultimately refused on 30.01.1992; Hence, the suit. <br/> <br/>Defendant nos. 5 and 6 contested the suit by filing joint written statement denying material allegations made in the plaint and contending interalia that the suit is not maintainable, barred by limitation, barred by the principles of waiver, estoppel and acquiescence and bad for defect of parties. Further contending that their predecessor Mansur Ali, only son of original owner of the suit land Nowab Ali, expired leaving six sons, two daughters and wife i.e. defendant nos. 4-12; Defendant no.1 executed bainanama on 25.01.1980 in favour of these defendants by taking consideration money of taka 8,000/- out of total consideration amount of taka 10,500/- and delivered possession thereof; Pursuant to said bainanama, defendant no.1 executed and registered sale deed dated 19.10.1983 in favour of these defendants  by taking rest of the consideration money; Plaintiff created Heba-bil-Ewaz with an ulterior motive and filed the suit with false pleas; Suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/>After hearing the parties and assessing evidence on record, learned Joint District Judge decreed the suit by his judgment and decree dated 25.10.1998. Challenging the decree, defendants filed Title Appeal No.124 of 1998. Appellate court below allowed the appeal and sent the case on remand for retrial. Pursuant to the judgment of the appellate court below, exhibit-‘Kha’ and exhibit-‘1’ were sent to the handwriting expert for comparison signature and LTI of Arafatunnessa. Handwriting expert send his report on 17.05.2001. After rehearing the parties and assessing evidence on record, learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit on contest against defendant nos. 5 and 6 and exparte against the rest.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved, plaintiff as appellant field Title Appeal No.95 of 2001 in the Court of learned District Judge, Jhalakati. On transfer the appeal was heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, Jhalakati, who after hearing the case and reassessing evidence on record dismissed the appeal vide his judgment and decree dated 23.08.2010 and thereby affirmed findings of the learned Joint District Judge.<br/> <br/>Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree, plaintiff-appellant as petitioner preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Nasir Uddin, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner confined his submission only one point i.e. sale deed dated 19.10.1983 registered in violation of section 28 of the Registration Act inasmuch as lands described in the schedule of the deed situated under Nalcity Sub-registrar office as such, the sale deed ought to be registered by the Sub-registrar of Nalcity as per provision of section 28 but the sale deed evidently registered by the registrar of Bakerganj who had no jurisdiction to register the document and without considering this legal aspect courts below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. In support of his submission, learned advocate referred to the case of Ali Azam Saial and others-Vs- Joynal Abedin Saial and others, reported in 61 DLR 299.<br/> <br/>On the other hand Mr. Md. Delwar Hossain with Ms. Salma Begum, learned advocates appearing for the opposite party nos.1 and 2 submits that it is apparent from the sale deed dated 19.10.1983 that the deed was registered by the Registrar of Bakerganj. By referring District Statistics 2011 publish by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, he submits that Bakergonj District established in 1797, lateron renamed as Barisal District, Jhalakati came into existence as a Sub-division of Barisal District in 1972 and upgraded to a District on 1<sup>st</sup> February, 1984 but the deed was registered at Bakerganj on 19.10.1983 which shows that the document was registered legally as per provision of law. He also submits that a question of law may be raised at any stage of the proceeding but if the determination of question of law is dependent upon prior determination of a question of fact then this principle of law will not be applicable as such, point raised by the learned advocate for the petitioner has no legal basis. He again submits that since there is no allegation in the plaint that the sale deed executed and registered fraudulently, the court cannot allow any departure from the earlier pleadings set forth in the plaint under order 6 rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Hafizuddin Ahmed and another-Vs- Mahbubul Huq and others, reported in 35 DLR (AD) 174, the case of Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) and Assistant Custodian, Vested Property, Dhaka and another-Vs- Most. Anju Bibi and others, reported in 2 MLR (AD) 291 and the case of Bangladesh-Vs- Md. Aslam and others, reported in 44 DLR 69.<br/> <br/>Heard the learned advocates. Perused revisional application, judgment and decree passed by the courts below alongwith lower Courts record and decisions cited by the learned advocates.<br/> <br/>On perusal of the record it appears that the plaintiff in his plaint did not make any statement that the sale deed dated 19.10.1983 was executed and registered fraudulently. He stated in the plaint that his mother executed and registered Heba-bil-Ewaj in favour of him on 23.10.1984 and delivered possession thereof but both the courts below arrived at a concurrent finding that plaintiff failed to prove his contention by adducing oral and documentary evidence. The only point agitated by the learned advocate for the petitioner is that the sale deed dated 19.10.1983 registered at Bakergonj is in violation of section 28 of the Registration Act inasmuch as lands described in the schedule of sale deed situated under Nalcity Sub-registrar office which amply proves that the sale deed was not registered in accordance with law. It is pertinent to mention here that the date of registration of the sale deed is 19.10.1983, when Section 30 of the Registration Act was in operation, subsequently omitted by ordinance L of 1985. Section 30, before omission, was as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong><em>“30. Registration by Registrars in certain cases</em></strong><em>-(1) Any Registrar may in his discretion receive and register any document which might be registered by any Sub-Registrar subordinate to him</em><br/><em>(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 28 any Registrar may receive and register any document without regard to the situation in any part of Bangladesh of the property to which the document relates if he is satisfied that there is sufficient cause for doing so.” </em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">It appears from exhibit ‘ka’ that the sale deed was registered by the District Registrar of Bakergonj on 19.10.1983 when section 30 of the Registration Act., was very much in existence as such, argument placed by the learned advocate for the petitioner does not hold water.<br/> <br/>Apart from that this point was neither agitated in the trial court nor in the appellate court below rather for the first time raised in this revisional jurisdiction. In the case of Hafizuddin Ahmed and another-Vs- Mahbubul Huq and others, reported in 35 DLR(AD) 174, our apex court held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“There is hardly any dispute that a question of law may be raised at any stage of a proceeding. But if the determination of a question of law is dependent upon prior determination of a question of fact then this principle of law will not be applicable.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Furthermore, it is evident from plaint and also from testimony of the PWs that the point urged by the learned advocate for the petitioner is a quite departure from the pleading set forth in the plaint under order 6 rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the case of Bangladesh-Vs- Md. Aslam and others, reported in 44 DLR 69, this Division held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><em>“The plaintiff must not make any departure from the earlier pleadings made in the plaint so as to bring into existence any new claim or raise any new ground or plea which are quite inconsistent, incongruous or a departure from the earlier stand or pleas. The Court will not allow either party from making any departure from the earlier pleadings set forth in the plaint or written statement. Plaint and written statement are the foundation of the claim of the plaintiff and the defendant; any deviation from the earlier stand would surely land the other side into serious dislocation and by 0rder 6 rule 7 of the Civil Procedure Code the same has been made prohibited”. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Under the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated above in the light of the decisions referred to, I do not find any reason to interfere with findings of the court below.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, Rule is discharged without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/>Judgment and decree dated 23.08.2010 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Jhalakati, in Title Appeal No. 95 of 2001 affirming judgment and decree dated 27.06.2001 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Jhalakati, in Title Suit No. 27 of 1994, is hereby maintained.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower courts record alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ed.</em></strong></div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>This is an application filed under section 51(2) read with section 98(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 2009 for rectification of Register of Trade Marks by imposing condition of disclaimer upon the Trade Mark No. 25566 in Class-32.<br/>It has been stated in the petition, amongst other that the petitioner company, Ibn Sina Food &amp; Chemical Industries Ltd, was registered as a private limited company on 22.6.1998 obtaining Incorporation Certificates NO.C-35655(2421)/98. Since incorporation, the petitioner adopted a good number of trademarks consisting of the work IBN SINA alongwith other descriptive or non-descriptive words.<br/><br/>That, the petitioner chose the word TANG, means flavour, a fully descriptive word for soft drinks after the words Ibn Sina Orange to form the Trademark Ibn Sina Orange TANG. Due to superior quality, wide range of publicity and extensive use, the trademark Ibn Sina Orange TANG earned unparalleled popularity and became distinctive of the products of the petitioner and of nobody else. The petitioner acquired exclusive proprietary right over the trademark Ibn Sina Orange TANG for its soft drink powder. To protect its right over the trademark Ibn Sina Orange Tang, the petitioner applied for registration of its trademark Ibn Sina Orange TANG in class-32 for which serial No.109102 was allocated. It also applied for BSTI  Licence in the year 2003 for producing and marketing its produce soft drink and obtained CM Licence No.5174/G-5/2003, dated 22.11.2003 which was applied for renewal on 30.6.2009.<br/><br/>That M/s. Sajeeb Corporation, represented by its proprietor shamima Haider Chowdhury and having its registered office at No.2, Tejturi Bazar (Indira Road), Tejgaon, Dhaka as sole Distributor of KRAFT General Foods of USA for Bangladesh market in respect of their products under registered Trade Mark Brand –‘TANG’ as the plaintiff instituted the Title Suit NO.27 of 2009 in the Court of the District Judge.</div><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 40px;"><li style="text-align: justify;">A decree declaring that the C.M. Certificate issued by the defendant No.2 under licence NO.5174/G-5/2006, dated 02.11.2006 in favour of defendant No.3 is violative and infringement of plaintiff’s Trade Mark and C.M. Certificate in respect of Soft drink product brand “TANG” issued by defendant No.5 and 2 are illegal, void, inoperative and without any lawful authority.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendant Nos. 3-4 from manufacturing, distributing and/or selling soft drink product under brand name “Ibn Sina Orange TANG” shown in schedule-B in any form using paper containers and packets or bottles in Bangladesh.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A decree in mandatory form directing the defendant Nos.3-4 to withdraw or call back the soft drink products with brand name “Ibn Sina Orange TANG” as shown in Schedule-B from all markets in Bangladesh.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The opposite parties, (plaintiff) in the said Title Suit, have also filed petition for temporary injunction and the court below has passed ad-interim injunction restraining the petitioner from manufacturing or selling or marketing soft drink under the name Ibn Sina Orange Tang. That, the very registration of the trademark TANG in respect of soft drink powder, in class-32 under No.25566, having a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, is violative of the section 6(a)(d) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as well as Trade Marks Act, 2009.<br/><br/>That, while making examination of the application No.25566 in class-32 in respect of Soft Drink Powder, the provision of law was not adhered to. A  highly descriptive word like TANG does not qualify for registration under section 6(1)(d) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 as well as Trade Marks Act, 2009 since the mark is not distinctive per se as the same is objectionable under section 6(1)(e) of both the Trade Marks Act, 1940 &amp; 2009.<br/><br/>On the other hand the opposite party Nos. 2 and 3 and appeared in this matter and filed two separate affidavit- in-opposition denying all materials allegations made in the petition.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Muhammad Muhiuddin, appearing for the petitioner, having placed the petition alongwith the supplementary affidavit submits that registration of word ‘Tang’ in the name of the opposite parties as soft drink, in Class 32 under No. 25566, having direct reference to character being descriptive in nature, the very registration itself is not legal accordingly to section 6(1) (d) of the Trade Marks Act, 2009. He further submits that the Trade Marks has been obtained, fraudulently or otherwise by managing the concerned authorities. Hence registration of trade mark ‘Tang’ in the name of the opposite parties is not valid. He further submits that in respect of other food items there is a provision for imposing disclaimer, thereby meaning that trade mark is not to be exclusively used by other manufactures, but by other parties manufacturing and marketing similar products. Accordingly he has prayed for imposing of disclaimer in respect of Trade Mark Tang in Class 32 Registered  under No. 25566, in the name of the petitioner.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Md. S.R. Khoshnabish, representing both opposite party Nos.2 and 3, having placed the affidavit-in-opposition, on the other hand submits that this petition under section 51(2) and 98(2) has been filed by suppressing the material facts from the knowledge of the court. Referring to a letter dated 14.9.2009, addressed to the officer-in-charge Fatullah Model P.S by the Examiner of the Patent, Design and Trade Marks Directorate (Annexure-C) to affidavit-in-opposition filed on behalf of the opposite party No.2, submits that a previous application was rejected by the concern authority by suppressing this facts they have filed this application. Referring to the statements made in paragraph No.1 of the petition, the learned Advocate for the opposite parties submits that admittedly Ibn Sina Food Chemical Industries limited  was registered on 21.6.1998, but the petitioner obtained registration of the Trade Mark in respect of word Tang on 2.7.1987 i.e long before incorporation of the petitioner. Then referring to 15 BLT(AD) 163, the learned Advocate submits that the commodities of the opposite parties are already in market and has become popular among the people and has obtained the registration of the Trade Mark on 2.7.1987 i.e long before the product of the petitioner was incorporated or started manufacturing its product and as such the petitioner is not entitled to file application for rectification of the registration entry or for imposing disclaimer. Thereafter, referring to another decision reported in 25 BLT(AD) 2005 page-146, the learned Advocate submits that the mark ‘Tang’ registered in favour of the opposite parties in Bangladesh and the mark is in the use for the said product through out the word. The opposite parties have already corned good name, good will and reputation in this country in respect of TANG, and therefore if the condition of disclaimer is allowed, there is likely hood of deception and confusion to arise in the mind of the buyers of the products of the opposite parties. For this reason as well this petition is liable to be rejected. Next, referring to another decision reported in 54 DLR 394, the learned advocate submits that the subsequent application for registration of Trade Mark is not maintainable, while the products of the opposite parties are in the market about 11/12 years before the products of the petitioner was manufactured. As such, the concerned authority has rightly rejected the prayer of the petitioner to register it’s Trade Mark  being ‘Ibn Sina Orange Tang’. Referring to another decision reported in 17 BLC (2012) 715, the learned advocate for the opposite parties submits that this petition is liable to be rejected for the reasons that the obvious similarity between the two marks is bound to create confusion in the minds of the public (who are mostly not able read English) and that this comes with the ambit of passing of. Hence their application was rightly rejected by the directorate of the Trade Marks and the present application is liable to be rejected as it has no merit and this is clearly contradictory to the laws settled by the apex court in the meantime.<br/><br/>I have heard the learned Advocates appearing for both sides, perused the application alongwith supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioner as well as the affidavits in opposition filed by the opposite party Nos. 2 and 3 along with the materials on record.<br/><br/>It appears that the petitioner has previously filed an application for registration of trade mark ‘Ibn Sina Tang’ and their prayer was rejected, as it evident from a letter No.15387/09 dated 14.9.2009 (Annexure-C2) to the affidavit in opposition of O.P No.2. But the petitioner has suppressed this facts in their petition as well as did not seek any remedy against rejection of their previous application. Hence apparently this petitioner has not come in clean hands before this court and by their conduct in abstaining from seeking any relief against rejection of their first application they have waived their claim in respect of ‘Ibn Sina Orange’ trade mark.<br/><br/>Besides, not only the trade mark sought to be registered, I have compared, I have also compared the products of the petitioner and that of the opposite  in packeted condition in which their products are being marketed. I find there is obvious similarity between the two packets and that can create confusion in the minds of the ordinary buyers and this is a clear case of passing of. Besides I also find that the petitioner company was registered on 21.6.1998 as admitted in paragraph No.1 of the petition, whereas the opposite parties got registration of their Mark Tang on 2.7.1987 i.e before the petitioner has started manufacturing and marketing their products in almost in similar name design, size and colour of packet. I find no grounds to allow the prayer for disclaimer as because it will deceive the buyers of the products of the petitioner, which is in the market since 1987 and has earned popularity amongst the buyers.<br/><br/>In this factual background I am of the view that the decision of the apex court reported in 15 BLT(AD) 163: Diptee  Industries Ltd and others Vs. Government of Bangladesh;  25 BLD(AD) 146: Sunil Kumar Das Vs. Canon Kavushiki  Kaisha and another Registered of Trade Mark Government of Bangladesh are squarely applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. Similarly the judgment reported in 54 DLR 294: Abdul Mannan Mia Vs. Md. Solimullah Mia and the decision reported in17 BLC 715 of this Division are also applicable to the facts and circumstance of this case.<br/><br/>In view of the law declared by the apex court, I am also of the view that this petition is not maintainable and has no merit. Besides it has been admitted in the petition itself that there is a pending Title Suit filed by the opposite party (as plaintiff), in which the petitioner was restrained by an order of ad-interim injunction from manufacturing and marketing their products under the marks ‘Ibn Sina Tang’ and that suit is still pending. The petitioner, if he has any grievance,  can seek remedy in appropriate forum as against the order passed by the court below. This court cannot allow multiplicity of proceedings in respect of a similar disputes between the same parties. <br/><br/>On this ground as well, I consider that this petition as an abuse of process of the court and is liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>In view of the deliberation made above this petition is dismissed without any order as to cots.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

The High Court Division rightly observed that the arbitral award is generally not open to review by Courts for any error in finding on facts and applying law for the simple reason that it would defeat the very purpose of the arbitration proceedings.         . . . (20)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Arbitration Act, (I of 2001)</strong><br/><strong>Section 39</strong><br/><strong>The Arbitration Act is a special law enacted with the aim of giving expeditious relief to parties who accede to the system of arbitration agreed upon in their contract and adjudicated upon in accordance with the Arbitration Act, 2001.

(21)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Arbitration Act, (I of 2001)</strong><br/><strong>Section 43</strong><br/><strong>The only ground of challenging the award is to be found section 43 of the Act, which provides that a challenge of the arbitral award is permitted only on the grounds set out in that section. . . . (22)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Arbitration Act, (I of 2001)</strong><br/><strong>Section 43</strong><br/><strong>Whenever an award is challenged before any Court, the Court, i.e. either District Court or as in this case the High Court Division, does not sit on appeal over the decision of the learned Arbitrator.

(43)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Arbitration Act, (I of 2001)</strong><br/><strong>Section 43</strong><br/><strong>The factual and contractual positions are matters for decision of the Arbitrator and as such, unless there appears to be gross illegality, neither the High Court Division nor this Division would enter into the merit of such arguments. . . . (24)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Arbitration Act, (I of 2001)</strong><br/><strong>Section 43</strong><br/><strong>With regard to the question of public policy, the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant, if we have understood correctly, is that it includes any decision by the learned Arbitrator without following the existing law of the country or traveling beyond the terms of the contract. . . .

That would be an illegality pure and simple. It would be giving too broad a meaning to the phrase ‘in conflict with public policy’ to include decisions which are contrary to law, or where the learned Arbitrator has traveled beyond the terms of his reference, or has misinterpreted a principle of law or precedent, or for misreading or non-consideration of evidence.

(26)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Contract Act, (IX of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 73</strong><br/><strong>The provisions of section 73 of the Contract Act are quite clear, inasmuch as whenever there is any loss or damage caused by the breach of a party to an agreement then the other party (the innocent party) who has incurred the loss as a result of the breach is entitled to receive compensation for any loss or damage.  . . .

The respondent M/S Dynamic Construction (Dynamic) is a proprietorship concern engaged in the construction of civil and electrical works. The appellant was appointed as contractor by the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB) an enterprise of the Bangladesh Power Development Board, for the Design and Construction of 230 KV Khulna-Bheramara-Ishurdi Transmission Line on turnkey basis under a contract executed on 30.05.2004. The appellant thereafter invited tenders from qualified contractors of Bangladesh in respect of the said work for being appointed as sub-contractors. The respondent submitted its bid and its offer was accepted. The appellant and the respondent along with two other contractors whose tenders had also been accepted held several meetings and an agreement was signed between the parties. In the final meeting held on 05.8.2004 Minutes of the Meeting (MOM) was drawn up and signed by the appellant and the respondent. In accordance with the provisions of the MOM the respondent was to undertake the work for construction of 68 KM. 230 KV transmission line between Khulna Central and New Khulna Sub-station under certain terms and conditions. The appellant thereafter, vide letter dated 10.09.2004, issued a Letter of Intent (LOI), <em>inter alia</em>, with a request to mobilise all resources so as to commence the foundation work on 01.10.2004. Accordingly, the respondent began the work of mobilisation for commencement of the work. It may be noted here that the Letter of Intent(LOI)dated 10.09.2004 stipulated that the respondent should “arrange mobilization of all resources based on this LOI, so as to commence foundation work on 1<sup>st</sup> October, 2004.” However, other conditions were mentioned “which would form an integral part of our detailed Purchase Order”. The first of these conditions was that the respondent had “to arrange approval from PGCB before commencement of foundation work i.e. before 1<sup>st</sup> October, 2004.” <br/><br/>While the respondent was performing its obligations in accordance with the LOI, the appellant terminated the contract by a fax massage dated 01.01.2005 (transmitted on 08.1.2005). The respondent vide letter dated 02.03.2006 disputed the letter of termination and invoked the arbitration proceeding by issuing a notice of arbitration. The parties mutually agreed to appoint Justice Naimuddin Ahmed to act as the sole Arbitrator for resolving the disputes between them.<br/><br/>The respondent (Claimant) made its claim by submitting its statement of claim stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in part performance of the contract, it mobilised the materials and equipment as instructed but the appellant illegally terminated the contract on 01.01.2005. In the statement of claim, the respondent claimed that he had invested the following amounts towards execution of the contract:<br/> </div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:378px; width:398px"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 32px;">A.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Stone Supplier- 2 Persons advance      </td><td style="width: 73px;">20,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">B.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Kuchi Stone Supplier-Person Advance  </td><td style="width: 73px;">10,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">C.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Rig advance Deposit</td><td style="width: 73px;"> 8,00,000/-   </td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">D.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Land collateral with Bank</td><td style="width: 73px;">30,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">E.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Land collateral with Bank    </td><td style="width: 73px;">20,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">F.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Stringing Equipment Lease</td><td style="width: 73px;">20,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">G.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Purchase of Automobile for Tk.</td><td style="width: 73px;">10,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">H.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Two times Travel Expense to India     </td><td style="width: 73px;"> 1,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">I.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Land visit supervisor and valuation</td><td style="width: 73px;"> 2,00,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">J.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Stockyard for Lease of properties (Land)</td><td style="width: 73px;"> 3,60,000/-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;">K.</td><td style="width: 172px;">Salary of 2 B.S.C Engineers 3 Diploma    </td><td style="width: 73px;"><u> 6,00,000/-</u></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 32px;"> </td><td style="width: 172px;"> </td><td style="width: 73px;">1,30,60,000/-</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The Claimant prayed for the following relief:</div><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-left: 40px;"><li style="text-align: justify;">A declaration to the effect that the termination of the contract by the respondent No. 1 (appellant) by the fax message dated 01.01.2005 is illegal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Damage to the tune of Tk. 1,30,60,000/ incurred by it for mobilisation of resources and</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Costs.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The appellant denied the allegations made in the statement of claim by filing a statement of defence and also laid a counter-claim against the claimant in the form of damage for a sum of Tk. 8,25,000/-.<br/><br/>The Arbitral Tribunal after hearing the parties passed the Award on 29.08.2006.

The claim of the claimant is allowed in part.

TPCI/BD/PGCB(W7)KI/62 dated January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2005 is illegal and without lawful authority, is dismissed.<br/>3. The counter-claim of the respondent No. 1 for damages to the tune of Taka 8,25,000.00/-to be payable by the claimant, is dismissed.<br/>4. Considering the circumstance that success is divided and other circumstances, the claimant and the respondent No. 1 are directed to bear their respective costs of this arbitration proceeding.<br/>5. The proceedings as against the respondents Nos. 2 and 3 stand dismissed.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Against the said award, the appellant Tata Power Company Limited filed Arbitration Case No. 3 of 2006 before the High Court Division.<br/><br/>By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court Division set aside the award of damage for the sum of Tk. 50,00,000/ under the head “land Collateral with Bank” under serial numbers 4 and 5 and upheld the remaining part of the award passed by the learned Arbitrator subject to the aforesaid modification.<br/><br/>Against the said judgement and order dated 05.06.2007 the appellant filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 114 of 2008.<br/><br/>Leave was granted to consider the following grounds:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>I. Whether the High Court Division acted illegally in not considering that the learned Arbitrator passed the Award of Tk. 1,11,60,000.00 in favour of the respondent contrary to the provisions of section 73 of the Contract Act, 1872 because the respondent having admittedly committed breach of contract is not entitled to get any compensation and as such, the award is clearly opposed to section 73 of the Contract Act.  <br/> II. Whether the High Court Division acted illegally in not considering that the learned Arbitrator misconducted himself in contradicting his own finding, on the one hand holding that the respondent breached the very important term of the contract while on the other hand awarded an amount of Tk. 1,11,60,000.00 as compensation to the respondent who himself was in breach of the contract in complete violation of section 73 of the Contract Act; and<br/>III. Whether the High Court Division acted illegally in not holding that no work under the contract including mobilisation could be done without obtaining permission from PGCB and no compensation is recoverable from the petitioner under the contract, the learned Arbitrator acted beyond his jurisdiction in traveling beyond the terms of contract, inasmuch as the learned Arbitrator having not identified any breach on the part of the petitioner, the award was opposed to law and public policy inasmuch as the High Court Division did not understand the true perspective of the word ‘public policy’ and its role in setting aside the said award dated 29.08.2006.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Ahsanul Karim, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant made submissions laying forth the grounds upon which leave was granted. He further submitted that the High Court Division should have considered that the claimant having himself been in breach of contract the learned Arbitrator completely misconceived section 73 of the Contract Act making Award of Tk. 1,11,60,000.00 in favour of the respondent. The learned Advocate also submitted that the High Court Division erred in not considering that the learned Arbitrator misconducted himself in not properly considering the provisions of the Contract Act and giving an award in favour of the claimant who did not qualify to make any claim at all since there was admittedly no breach of contract by the respondent (appellant herein). His final submission was that the learned Arbitrator acted beyond his jurisdiction in traveling beyond the terms of contract which were fundamental in any claim based on it. There being no breach on the part of the appellant the award was opposed to law and public policy, inasmuch as the High Court Division did not understand the true perspective of the word ‘public policy’ and its role in setting aside the said award dated 29.08.2006.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.Y. Mosheuzzaman, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent made submission in support of the judgement and order of the High Court Division. In addition he submitted that the loss incurred by the respondent was due to part performance of the contract which was instigated by the appellant in terms of the Letter of Intent dated 10 September, 2004 and Work Order dated 28 October, 2004. It was at the behest of the appellant that the respondent mobilised materials and equipment as instructed by the appellant and, hence, the learned Arbitrator rightly passed an award in favour of the respondent. He further submitted that under section 43 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 an arbitral award may be set aside only if it is opposed to the law for the time being in force in Bangladesh or if it is in conflict with public policy in Bangladesh. He submitted that in the instant case, since the award is neither opposed to the law nor is in conflict with public policy, and there is no allegation that it was induced by fraud or corruption, there was no ground for the appellant to seek an order for setting aside the award. He also submitted that the arbitration award is not liable to be brought under scrutiny before the High Court Division since that Division does not sit as a Court of appeal over the award of the learned Arbitrator. In support of his contention he referred to the decision reported in the case of <strong>Shahabullah (Md.) Vs. The State</strong> reported in <strong><em>43 DLR, 1.</em></strong> He further submitted that the High Court Division is not at liberty to interfere with the award passed by the learned Arbitrator other than on the grounds mentioned above (as provided under section 43 of the Arbitration Act, 2001). He submitted that the award of the Arbitrator could not be assailed by reassessing and reappraising evidence considered by the learned Arbitrator. In support of his contention he referred to the decision in the case of <strong><em>M/s Sudarsan Trading Co., v. The Govt. of Kerala and another</em></strong> reported in <strong>AIR 1989 SC, 890</strong> and in the case of<strong><em> The President, Union of India and another, v. Kalinga Construction Co. (P) Ltd.</em></strong> reported in<strong><em> AIR 1971 SC, 1646.</em></strong><br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgement as well as other evidence and materials on record.<br/><br/>The claim of the respondent in this case, which was contested before the learned Arbitrator appointed upon agreement of both the parties, is based on the LOI dated 10.09.2004 and  a Work Order dated 28<sup>th</sup> October, 2004 which in turn reflected the arrangement between the parties, as contained in the Minutes of Meeting dated 5<sup>th</sup> August, 2004. In that meeting the appellant and the respondent discussed finalisation of a contract for the construction of a 230 KV Khulna-Bheramara-Ishurdi Transmission Line by the respondent as a sub-contractor. One of the terms agreed in that meeting was that the work order given to the respondent would be valid only if PGCB approved the respondent as a sub-contractor. This condition was again reflected in Column 10 of Article 8 of the Work Order dated 28 October, 2004. It may be mentioned at this stage that the respondent admitted that he did not take approval of the PGCB. On the other hand, the respondent based his claim for expenditure incurred in placing materials and equipment on the site in accordance with the Letter of Intent dated 10 September, 2004.<br/><br/>We find that the Letter of Intent (Annexure-C) contains a request by the appellant to the respondent to accept the Letter of Intent and “arrange mobilisation of all resources based on this LOI”. We note from the LOI also that there is a condition that the respondent was to arrange approval from PGCB before commencement of foundation work, i.e. before 1<sup>st</sup> October, 2004. The claim of the respondent is that on the basis of the LOI and Work Order it was pressurised by the appellant into mobilisation of materials and equipment.<br/><br/>At this juncture we note that admittedly neither any work was done nor any mobilisation commenced before 1<sup>st</sup> November, 2004. The respondent first wrote to PGCB for approval as sub-contractor on 4<sup>th</sup> November, 2004. In fact PGCB refused to accord approval to the respondent on 14.12.2004. It must also be borne in mind that the appellant was the contractor under PGCB and, therefore, without the approval of the sub-contractor (respondent) by PGCB, the appellant would be unable to complete its contract with PGCB through the engagement of the respondent.<br/><br/>However, the terms and conditions of the LOI, Work Order and Minutes of the Meeting are all factual matters which have been dealt with by the learned Arbitrator and which in our view cannot be within the ambits of either the High Court Division or this Division to consider. The High Court Division rightly observed that the arbitral award is generally not open to review by Courts for any error in finding on facts and applying law for the simple reason that it would defeat the very purpose of the arbitration proceedings. <br/>The Arbitration Act is a special law enacted with the aim of giving expeditious relief to parties who accede to the system of arbitration agreed upon in their contract and adjudicated upon in accordance with the Arbitration Act, 2001. Under this Act the decision of the Arbitrator making the arbitral award is final and binding both on the parties and on any persons claiming through or under them. Section 39 of the Act provides as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>"৩৯. রোয়েদাদ চূড়ান্ত ও বাধ্যকর- (১) কোন সালিস চুক্তির ধারাবাহিকতায় সালিসী ট্রাইব্যুনাল কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত রোয়েদাদ চূড়ান্ত হইবে এবং উহা পক্ষগণ এবং তাহাদের মাধ্যমে বা অধীনে দাবীদার যে কোন ব্যক্তির উপর বাধ্যকর হইবে</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">(২) উপ-ধারা (১)এ যাহা কিুছুই থাকুক না কেন, এই আইনের বিধান অনুসারে সালিসী রোয়েদাদের বিরুদ্ধে কোন ব্যক্তির আপত্তি উত্থাপনের অধিকার ক্ষুন্ন হইবে না''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The only ground of challenging the award is to be found section 43 of the Act, which provides that a challenge of the arbitral award is permitted only on the grounds set out in that section. Section 43 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 has been quoted in the impugned judgement. For our purposes the provisions relevant for the instant case are as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>"৪৩ সালিসী রোয়েদাদ বাতিলের কারণসমুহ- (১) কোন সালিসী রোয়েদাদ বাতিল করা যাইতে পারে, যদি-<br/>………………<br/>(খ) আদালত  কিংবা ক্ষেত্রমত, হাইকোর্ট বিভাগ এই মর্মে সন্তুষ্ট হয় যে-<br/>(আ) সালিসী রোয়েদাদ দৃশ্যতঃ বাংলাদেশে প্রচলিত কোন আইনের পরিপন্থি;<br/>(ই)) সালিসী রোয়েদাদ বাংলাদেশের জননীতির পরিপন্থি; অথবা<br/>…………………<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, the scope of interference with the arbitral award is very limited as has been held in the cases cited by Mr. Moshiuzzaman. Whenever an award is challenged before any Court, the Court, i.e. either District Court or as in this case the High Court Division, does not sit on appeal over the decision of the learned Arbitrator. Therefore, the scope of considering the merits of the case and factual aspects is again very limited.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the provisions of the Arbitration Act relevant for our purposes, as urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant, are found in section 43 (1)(b)(ii) and(iii). In view of the above proposition that the High Court Division does not sit on appeal over the arbitral award, the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant with regard to fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the terms of the contract is somewhat redundant. The factual and contractual positions are matters for decision of the Arbitrator and as such, unless there appears to be gross illegality, neither the High Court Division nor this Division would enter into the merit of such arguments.<br/><br/>With regard to the question of public policy, the submission of the learned Advocate for the appellant, if we have understood correctly, is that it includes any decision by the learned Arbitrator without following the existing law of the country or traveling beyond the terms of the contract. In the civil petition for leave to appeal it was contended that any misinterpretation of a well settled principle of law or leading precedent or misreading and non-consideration of evidence amount to an act against public policy and that it means and includes also to ensure justice and rule of law.<br/><br/>The learned Judge of the High Court Division quoted the explanation in section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 of India (“1996 Act”) which is similar to section 43(1)(b)(iii) of our Arbitration Act, 2001, which provides that an award would be treated to be in conflict with the public policy of India, if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81. The High Court Division then went on to suggest what might be considered public policy, but ultimately decided that “the application of the concept of public policy for the purpose of setting aside an award is rendered difficult.” The learned Judge concluded that the award was not patently illegal or so unfair and unreasonable that it could be labeled as being in conflict with public policy.<br/><br/>We also feel that a definition of public policy would make it easier to decide what would be considered as being in conflict with public policy. In the absence of such definition, we are to rely upon the usual meaning of the phrase ‘public policy’ which according to Black’s Law Dictionary, 18<sup>th</sup> Edition is: “Broadly, principles and standards regarded by the legislature or by the courts as being of fundamental concern to the state and the whole of society”. It could be said, for example, that if the decision of the learned Arbitrator would have a negative impact on the future of international agreements by foreign companies investing in Bangladesh, then such a decision could be terms as being in conflict with public policy. However, in the facts of the instant case we do not consider that the contract entered into by the parties or the award made by the learned Arbitrator has any impact on the state and the whole of society. We also cannot agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that a decision contrary to the law of the country is necessarily in conflict with public policy an envisaged by the Act, 2001. That would be an illegality pure and simple. It would be giving too broad a meaning to the phrase ‘in conflict with public policy’ to include decisions which are contrary to law, or where the learned Arbitrator has traveled beyond the terms of his reference, or has misinterpreted a principle of law or precedent, or for misreading or non-consideration of evidence. These matters can be considered as matters relating to propriety, but are not, in our view, matters relating to public policy.<br/>    <br/>The appellant before us raised the issue before the High Court Division as well as before this Division that the respondents did not fulfill their part of the  contract, inasmuch as they were unable to obtain approval from PGCB and, therefore, according to the terms of the Letter of Intent and the Work Order they could not have commenced the mobilisation. Furthermore, it was submitted that since there was a stipulation that the Work Order for the foundation would commence by 1<sup>st</sup> of November, 2004, that having not been done, and the respondent having applied for approval from PGCB on 4<sup>th</sup> of November, 2004, (page 152 of the paper book) they were already in breach of the contract and, accordingly, the appellant rightly terminated the contract. It was pointed out by the learned Advocate for the appellant that the learned Arbitrator found that till 12.01.2005 the claimant could not secure the approval of the PGCB as required by the agreement. The learned Arbitrator observed that the Claimant admitted that he could not procure the approval of the PGCB. As such, the claimant failed to perform an important term of the contract and for this failure the respondent No. 1 (appellant herein) was entitled to terminate the contract as per the term of the contract. Accordingly, the learned Arbitrator found that the order of termination of the contract between the parties by respondent No. 1 (appellant herein) has been according to law and the terms of the contract. This finding of the learned Arbitrator is not amenable to challenge before any Court.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the respondent (claimant) claimed before the learned Arbitrator as well as before the High Court Division and this Division that it was entitled to claim damages for incurring expenditure towards facilitating the work with which it had been entrusted under the contract and as such, mobilisation of resources for commencing the actual work, was rightly claimed. In this connection the learned Arbitrator relied upon the decision in the case of <strong><em>Anglia Television Limited v Reed</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>3 All ER (1971) 690.</em></strong> The respondent relied upon this case as well as the materials on record which tend to show that it at the insistence of the appellant that it commenced mobilisation of equipment and materials.<br/><br/>One other point argued before us was that the respondent was required to submit a Performance Guarantee and Bank Guarantee before the contract would take effect and that no such guarantee was furnished. It was the claim of the respondent before the learned Arbitrator that due to the failure of the claimant to furnish bank guarantee and to obtain approval of PGCB which were both preconditions of the contract, there was no contract at all.<br/><br/>On this issue the learned Arbitrator observed that had there been no contract, the respondent No. 1 (appellant herein) would not have issued the Work Order and would not have issued instructions to the claimant to mobilise resources. The learned Arbitrator relied on the principle laid down in the case of<strong><em> Anglia Television Limited v. Reed</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>3 All ER (1971) 690</em></strong> where it was held that the claimant is entitled to recover the damage for expenditure which it claimed to have incurred under mutual arrangement with the respondent No. 1 (appellant herein) in order to facilitate the work under the contract.  <br/><br/>The High Court Division agreed with the decision of the learned Arbitrator so far as the claim of the respondent is concerned save and except the claim for 50,00000/- Taka in respect of “land collateral with bank”.<br/><br/>Before the High Court Division as well as before this Division learned Counsel for the appellant made a submission to the effect that only the person in breach of contract is liable for the loss and damage caused by the breach of contract. He submitted that the learned Arbitrator wrongly applied the principle of the decision in <strong><em>Anglia Television Limited v Reed.</em></strong> He pointed out that in the case under reference the defendant entered into the contract knowing that expenditure had already been incurred by the plaintiffs and, therefore, the defendant must have contemplated, or it was reasonable to impute contemplation to him, that if he broke the contract the expenditure would be wasted.<br/><br/>Let us consider Section 73 of the Contract Act which provides as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><em>“73.</em><strong><em>Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract-</em></strong><em>when a contract has been broken the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach of it. </em><br/><em>Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Kamaluddin Hossain J. (as his Lordship was then) in <strong><em>Amin Jute Mills vs M/s A.R.A.E. </em></strong>28 D.L.R (AD)76- referring to section 73 of the Contract Act observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><em>“An analysis of section shows that, when it is found that a party to a contract is in breach, he must pay compensation for the loss or damages caused by the breach to the other contracting party. That is the principal consideration.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>It was held in the case of <strong><em>K.M. SHAFI LIMITED V. GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH AND OTHERS</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>1983 BLD (AD)109</em></strong> that in a dispute over a contract the Arbitrator is the sole judge.<em> Per</em> Badrul Haider Chowdhury J. (as his Lordship was then), “Unless the award of the Arbitrator can be assailed on one of the three grounds mentioned in section 30 of the Arbitration Act the long line of cases show that the Court will not interfere even though courts may take a different view of the interpretation of the particular terms of contract. This is a sound principle. Otherwise such disputes should be brought within the jurisdiction of the civil court and thereby opening a flood gate of litigations nullifying the very spirit of the Arbitration as mentioned in the Arbitration Act” (His Lordship was referring to Act X of 1940).  <br/>   <br/>Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that when the learned Arbitrator found that the claimant (respondent herein) was himself in breach of contract and that the claimed loss and damage was not caused by the breach of the appellant he should have held that the claim is not sustainable.<br/><br/>The provisions of section 73 of the Contract Act are quite clear, inasmuch as whenever there is any loss or damage caused by the breach of a party to an agreement then the other party (the innocent party) who has incurred the loss as a result of the breach is entitled to receive compensation for any loss or damage. In other words, in the facts of the instant case, had it been found that the appellants were in breach of contract and the respondents (claimant before the Arbitrator) had incurred loss and damage as a result of the breach, then surely there would have been a claim by the respondents. But in the facts of the instant case it is abundantly clear that the learned Arbitrator found as a matter of fact that the claimant was in breach and that the termination of the contract by the   appellant was according to law and the terms of the contract. Having decided this issue against the claimant, clearly the decision in the case of<strong><em> Anglia Television Limited v Reed</em></strong> no longer remains applicable. The principle in the said case, i.e. the ability to claim to the extent of loss and damage incurred before contract still stands good, but it must be subject to the provision of the Contract Act, i.e. that the person who is in breach will be liable to make good the loss of the person who suffers as a result of the breach. Moreover, in that case the defendant was aware at the time of entering the contract that expenditure had already been incurred for which he would be liable in case of breach by him. <br/><br/>We are, therefore, of the opinion that in order to be entitled to claim for a loss incurred due to a breach of contract, the claimant must prove that the loss incurred was due to the breach of the defendant and that the loss incurred was within the contemplation of the defendant at the time of signing the contract. <br/>Since in the facts of the instant case the finding of the learned Arbitrator was that it was the claimant who was in breach of the contract and not the defendant, clearly the claimant does not qualify to claim under section 73 of the Contract Act. In this regard we may refer to the decision in the case of <strong><em>Bangladesh Power Development Board and others vs. M/s Arab Contractor (BD) Limited and others</em></strong>, where it was held that: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/><em>“An analysis of section shows that, when it is found that a party to a contract is in breach, he must pay compensation for the loss or damages caused by the breach to the other contracting party. That is the principal consideration”.   </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In the instant case the clear finding being that the appellant  was not in breach of the contract and had rightly terminated the contract due to breach of the terms by the respondent, no question of liability will arise against the appellant. This being a fundamental question of law and the learned Arbitrator having totally overlooked the existing law on the issue, the arbitral award was rightly challenged under section 43 (1)(b)(ii) of the Arbitration Act.<br/><br/>In view of the above discussion, we find merit in the appeal which is allowed without, however, any order as to costs. Accordingly, the impugned judgement as well as the Award of the learned Arbitrator are set aside.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ed.</em></strong></div></div></div>
