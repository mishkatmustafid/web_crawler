(43)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 145(2)</strong><br/><strong>Language employed in Article 145(2) which clearly suggests that the Article applies to matters  of civil liability, not in the case of criminal liability. We have already held that in the instant case the issue is determination </strong><strong>of criminal liability of the petitioner in respect</strong><strong> of the alleged offence under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Act, 1947 <em>i.e</em>., criminal breach of trust by </strong><strong>public servant, criminal misconduct by a public</strong><strong> servant and abetment of the offence. . . .(53)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 145</strong><br/><strong>Anti Corruption Act (V of 2004)</strong><br/><strong>Section 17</strong><br/><strong>The Constitution has not given any immunity</strong><strong> to the Prime Minister or the Cabinet in respect of any criminal offence. There is neither any constitutional nor any statutory </strong><strong>or legal bar on the ACC to conduct an enquiry</strong> <strong>in respect of allegation of commission of offence</strong><strong> mentioned in the schedule to the ACC Act, 2004. Therefore, ACC is legally empowered under section 17 of Act, 2004 to conduct any enquiry, the subject matter of which may fall under Article 145 of the Constitution, so long as it attracts criminal liability and ACC acts within the ambit of law. . . .(55)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Prevention of Corruption Act (II of 1947)</strong><br/><strong>Section 2</strong><br/><strong>Criminal Law Amendment Act (XL of 1958)</strong><br/><strong>Section 5</strong><br/><strong>A State Minister, no doubt, is a public servant</strong><strong> within the meaning of Act, 1947 read with Act, 1958. . . .(60)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Prevention of Corruption Act (II of 1947)</strong><br/><strong>Section 5(1)</strong><br/><strong>Criminal Law Amendment Act (XL of 1958)</strong><br/><strong>Section 5</strong><br/><strong>In the instant case the allegation against the petitioner that she otherwise abused her </strong><strong>office or abetted others to use the office for any</strong><strong> illegal gain within the meaning of criminal misconduct as defined in section 5(1) of the Act, 1947 or her alleged involvement as an abettor under section 109 of the Penal Code cannot be determined in a separate criminal </strong><strong>proceeding and the same must be adjudicated</strong><strong> in the instant proceeding by the Special Judge appointed under section 5 of the Act, 1958. Abetment under section 109 of the Penal </strong><strong>Code is such an offence which can be inferred</strong><strong> from the conduct of the accused and attending circumstances of the case. It may be proved either by oral, or documentary or circumstantial evidence. So, the issue as to whether the Prime Minister is the public servant is irrelevant in the instant case inasmuch as section 109 of the Penal Code (abetment of the offence) is present in the case and other public servants are also accused in the case. . . .(62)</strong><br/> <br/><strong><em>Sheikh Hasina Wazed alias Sheikh Hasina Vs.

Nuruzzaman, J.</u></strong><br/> <br/>In this application under Article 102 of the Constitution Rule was issued on 09.07.2008 calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the proceeding of Special Case No. 16 of 2008 arising out of Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 20 dated 09.12.2007 corresponding to A.C.C. General Registered Case No. 161/07, now pending in the Court of Special Judge, Court No. 9, Dhaka should not be declared unlawful, without jurisdiction and quashed and/or such other or further order or orders to be passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>At the time of issuance of the Rule this Court passed an interim order staying all further proceedings of the said Special Case for a period of 2(two) months which was extended for a further period of 3(three) months on 28.8.2008 and then till disposal of the Rule on 24.11.2008.<br/> <br/>Upon an application for correction filed by the petitioner, this Court on 17.07.2008 passed the following order:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“This is an application for correction.<br/>It is stated that words “without legal sanction” were not typed inadvertently in the petition and the words “done” was typed in place of the words “initiated and is being continued” and as such the words “without legal sanction” should be inserted after the word “Dhaka” at page No. 69 of 4<sup>th</sup> line from bottom of the prayer “A” and the words “initiated and is being continued” should be replaced after the word “have been” in place of the word “done at page No. 69 of 3<sup>rd</sup> line from bottom in prayer “A” of this writ petition and without jurisdiction should be added at end of the prayer A.<br/>Perused the application and heard the learned advocate. On the ground stated therein the application is allowed.<br/>Let this application be formed part of the main petition and kept with the record to be considered at the time of hearing.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The proceeding of Special Case mentioned in the Rule issuing order is under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code, 1860 read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.<br/> <br/>The petitioner is the former Prime Minister of the Government of Bangladesh. She was elected thrice as the Prime Minister. She was also the Leader of the Opposition of the Parliament. She is the Chairperson of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (B.N.P.).<br/> <br/>Following an inquiry, Anti-Corruption Commission (in short ‘ACC’) vide memo No. <strong>দুদক/৭৬-২০০৭ (অনুঃ-১)/১১৯৪০</strong> dated 09.12.2007 under the signature of Deputy Director of the ACC accorded sanction to lodge an F.I.R. against the petitioner and others under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (in short ‘Act, 1947’) and section 109 of the Penal Code. Thereafter, on 07.12.2007 an Assistant Director of the ACC lodged an F.I.R. with Tejgaon Police Station against the petitioner and 4 (four) others and accordingly Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 20 dated 09.12.2007 under section 5(2) of the Act, 1947 read with section 109 of the Penal Code started against the F.I.R. named accused persons.<br/> <br/>The prosecution case, in brief, is that in 1997 NIKO Resources Bangladesh Ltd. (in short ‘NIKO’) participated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> round bidding for oil and gas exploration in Bangladesh and was declared ineligible by the Technical and Financial Evaluation Committee. Being unsuccessful in the tender, NIKO then submitted a proposal before the then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for extraction of gas from the small size gas fields of Bangladesh and that proposal was also rejected. On 28.06.1998 NIKO again submitted a proposal before the Secretary of the Ministry of the Energy and Mineral Resources showing Chatak, Fenchugonj, Biani Bazar and Kamta Gas fields as non-producing and marginal and proposed to develop and extract gas from these gas fields. Thereafter, Framework of Underst-anding (FOU) was signed on 23.08.1999 between BAPEX and NIKO to conduct a joint study for the development and production of hydrocarbon from the non-producing marginal gas fields of Chatak, Feni and Kamta. Subsequently, on 14.06.2001 the then Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina approved a ‘Procedure for Development of Marginal and Abandoned Gas Fields’ in which Chatak, Feni and Kamta gas fields were identified as marginal and abandoned with instructions to finalize a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for extraction of gas by NIKO from those fields and place the JVA before the Government for approval.<br/> <br/>After the change of Government, NIKO, on 17.11.2001, made a representation to the then State Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources to finalize the said Joint Venture Agreement (JVA). To follow up the matter on 29.07.2002 a meeting was held between Petrobangla and BAPEX which was presided over by the Secretary, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. In the said meeting it was decided that Chatak gas field means Chatak (west) and it does not include Chatak (east). The JVA agreement as proposed by NIKO shall apply to Chatak (west). As per decision of the said meeting BAPEX informed NIKO that Chatak (east) gas field will not be included in the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA). On 10.08.2002 NIKO made representation to the concerned State Minister for inclusion of Chatak (east) gas field in the Joint Venture Agreement. Along with the representation NIKO enclosed a legal opinion given by its legal advisor, namely Moudud Ahmed and Associates, a Law Firm owned by the then Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Barrister Moudud Ahmed. In the legal opinion it was opined that chatak gas field means and includes the area specified in Exhibit-A of the Framework of Understanding (FOU) approved in 1997 in which the Chatak eastern territory is included. Then, the State Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources gave instruction to conclude the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) as per Framework of Understanding (FOU). Since BAPEX and Petrobangla did not finalize the JVA by including Chatak (east) in there, NIKO again vide two letters dated 25.11.2002 and 03.03.2003 respectively requested to include Chatak (east) in the JVA. Opinion was sought from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs as to whether Chatak (east) would be included as part of Chatak Marginal/ Abandoned Gas fields. Barrister Moudud Ahmed, the then Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs gave opinion on 17.03.2003 which is similar to that of the earlier opinion dated 10.08.2002 given by his Law Firm. Thereafter, a summary was prepared for the purpose of finalizing the JVA and also for resolving the dispute between BAPEX and NIKO in respect of defining Chatak Gas field. Vide memo dated 18.03.2003 the said summary was presented before the petitioner for approval who was the Minister-in-charge of Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry. The petitioner approved the summary in the following terms:<br/> </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">আইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক ম¿»ণালয়ের প্রাপ্ত মতামতের আলোকে ছাতক গ্যাস ফিল্ড Frame Work of Understanding (FOU) Hl Exhibit-A তে বর্ণিত মতে বিবেচনা করা যেতে পারেz এবং</li><li style="text-align: justify;">বাপেক্স ও নাইকো রিসোর্সেস লিঃ এর মধ্যে যৌথ সহযোগিতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষরের জন্য প্রাক্তন প্রধানমন্ত্রী কর্তৃক ১৪/৬/২০০১ তারিখে অনুমোদিত প্রাক এবং পরিত্যক্ত গ্যাস ফিল্ড উন্নয়ন সংজ্ঞা পদ্ধতি (Procedure For Development of Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Fields) এর মাঝে বর্ণিত সমুদয় শর্ত এবং অপরাপর প্রাসঙ্গিক বিধি-বিধান অনুসরণে যৌথ সহযোগিতা চুক্তি (Joint Venture Agreement) এর খসড়া চুড়ান্তকরণের জন্য পেট্রোবাংলা-কে নির্দেশ প্রদান করা যেতে পারে”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Thereafter, the draft Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was finalized and on 07.09.2002 a summary along with the draft Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was sent to the Prime Minister (the petitioner) for approval, but the same was sent back without any comment/ approval. Mr. A.K.M. Mosharaf Hossain the then State Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources wrote a note on the file being no. 397 stating that a discussion with Prime Minister was held on 15.09.2003 in which she mentioned that on 18.03.2003 she had already approved the summary proposal of the Ministry and as such re-approval of the Prime Minister is not required.<br/> <br/>On 16.10.2003 the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was signed between BAPEX and NIKO permitting NIKO to extract 1744 BCF gas from Chatak and Feni gas field which is worth Taka 10,000 (ten thousand) crore.<br/> <br/>The case was investigated by an officer of the ACC, who, after completion of the investigation, submitted charge sheet no. 156 dated 05.05.2008 against the petitioner and 10 (ten) others  under sections 409/ 109 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. In the charge sheet it has been stated that the ACC vide memo No. <strong>সি/১৫৯-২০০৯(তদ¿¹-২) ৬৮০৫</strong> dated 30.04.2008 accorded sanction to submit the charge sheet.<br/> <br/>After submission of the charge sheet the case records were transmitted to the Court of Metropolitan Senior Special Judge, Dhaka who vide order dated 07.05.2008 took cognizance of the offence against the petitioner and 10 others under section 409 of the Penal Code, section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with section 109 of the Penal Code. Charge has not been framed yet in the case.<br/> <br/>The respondent no. 1 ACC contested the Rule by filing an affidavit-in-opposition. The respondent no. 1 did not controvert facts stated in the writ petition. The case of the respondent no. 1 is that it lodged the F.I.R. and submitted charge sheet against the petitioner and others after compliance of provisions of law. Both in the F.I.R. and the charge sheet there are specific allegations against the petitioner which can only be decided on evidence, both oral and/or documentary as well as circumstantial. The instant writ petition is not maintainable in its present form and manner, and as such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>The petitioner filed an affidavit-in-reply annexing copies of the F.I.R. and charge sheet of Special Case No. 05 of 2008 rebutting the statements made in the affidavit-in-opposition.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali, along with Mr. Bodruddoza and Mr. Raghib Rouf Chowdhury, the learned Advocates appearing for the petitioner places before us the writ petition, the F.I.R., charge sheet and other materials on record. We have extensively heard the submissions advanced by the learned Advocates of both sides. During the course of hearing the learned Advocates of both sides relied upon number of decisions in support of their arguments.<br/> <br/>Prior to entering upon assessment of the arguments of the parties and the merit of the case, it is pertinent to mention that the case in hand has some distinctive features as well as a chequered history. The case is commonly known as ‘NIKO Graft’ case. Facts of the case stretch back to the era of the erstwhile Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who held the office from 23.06.1996 to 15.07.2001 and the successive Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia (the petitioner) who held the office from 10.10.2001 to 29.10.2006. <br/> <br/>In the charge sheet of the instant case it has been stated that the then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and others were involved in the alleged offence at the preliminary stage (প্রাপ্ত তথ্যের আলোকে  শেখ হাসিনা... অত্র অপরাধের প্রাথমিক পর্যায়ে সংশ্লিষ্ট ছিলেন বলে তথ্য প্রমান পাওয়া যায়) and since a separate case being Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 19 dated 09.12.2007 has been lodged, they including the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are not recommended to be included in the charge sheet to be sent up for trial.<br/>Against the above backdrop, Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, places before us the case of <strong><em>Sheikh Hasina Wazed alias Sheikh Hasina vs. State and another</em></strong> 63 DLR 40 which relates to the offence committed, as alleged by the ACC, at the preliminary stage of the NIKO saga and arises out of Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 19 dated 09.12.2007. The learned Advocate submits that in the case of <em>Sheikh Hasina,</em> the High Court Division quashed the proceedings of the case against her upon consideration of both facts and laws. He submits that facts of the case of <em>Sheikh Hasina</em> and those of the instant case, so far as they relate to the petitioner, are same and as such the fate of the petitioner should be the same as that of <em>Sheikh Hasina</em>. The learned Advocate employs the Bengali saying “<strong>একই যাত্রায় পৃথক ফল হওয়া উচিৎ না</strong>”. Mr. Ali submits that since the petitioner stands on the same footing as that of the erstwhile Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the proceeding against whom has been quashed, it is not legally possible to prosecute the successive Prime Minister Khaleda Zia <em>i.e.</em>, the present petitioner.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali next submits that the allegation against the petitioner is that she approved the summary on 18.03.2003 and instructed Petrobangla  to finalize the draft Joint Venture Agreement as per ‘Procedure for Development of Marginal Abandoned Gas Fields’ which was approved by the then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 14.06.2001. Joint Venture Agreement was signed on 16.10.2003 and thus, the Swiss Challenge Tender Procedure was avoided which would have ensured transparency and competition in awarding contract to foreign company to extract gas in Bangladesh. Under the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) NIKO was given an exclusive authority to extract gas from the gas fields and the entire process of awarding the contract to NIKO through JVA not only lacks transparency and competition but also is illegal which has caused huge financial loss to the country and rendered illegal benefit to NIKO and others. Mr. Ali draws our attention to the charge sheet, the relevant portion of which runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“Policy <strong>এর পরিবর্তে বিতর্কিত</strong> Procedure <strong>প্রবর্তন  দুর্নীতির বিষয়ে দেখা যায় যে, এ দেশে তেল ও গ্যাস অনুসন্ধান ও উৎপাদনের লক্ষ্যে সরকারের সাথে সরাসরি কোন বিদেশী কোম্পানীর</strong> Joint Venture Agreement <strong>(ওটঅ) করার কোন নীতিমালা বা দিক নির্দেশনা ছিল না এমনকি কোন মডেল ওটঅ কখনো প্রণয়ন করা হয়নি</strong>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Mr. Ali submits that since admittedly there was no law/ rule/ guideline/ policy for entering into Joint Venture Agreement, there cannot be any violation of law or illegality in approving JVA by the petitioner. Mr. Ali refers to Article 55(2) and Article 145(2) of the Constitution and submits that the executive power of the Republic is exercised by or on the authority of the Prime Minister and where a contract is made or executed in exercise of the executive authority of the Republic, neither the President nor any other person making or executing the contract in exercise of that authority is personally liable in respect thereof. Mr. Ali further adds that unless it can be shown that the petitioner committed criminal misconduct as defined in section 5(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, section 17 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 does not authorize the ACC to scrutinize the acts of the Prime Minister or the Cabinet in taking an executive decision in the performance of their functions of the Republic, and as such, the same cannot be called in question by ACC.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ali argues that in the instant case the prosecution materials do not reveal any criminal intention on part of the petitioner which is <em>sine qua non </em>for an offence under section 5(1) of the Act, 1947. To substantiate the contention Mr. Ali refers to the case of <strong><em>Begum Khaleda Zia vs. State</em></strong> 55 DLR 596 and submits that this case has been referred to and relied upon in the case of <em>Sheikh Hasina</em> 63 DLR 40. Mr. Ali contends that there is no allegation whatsoever against the petitioner that she committed any criminal misconduct.<br/> <br/>Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali further argues that section 5(1) of the Act, 1947 applies to public servant and according to the Constitutional provisions and analogy drawn from the ratio laid down in the case of <strong><em>Sk. Mujibur Rahman vs. The State</em></strong> 15 DLR 549 (relevant part at paragraph 31) the Prime Minister is not a public servant, and, as such, the petitioner, who is the former Prime Minister, cannot be prosecuted under section 5(2) of the Act, 1947.<br/> <br/>Mr. Ali next submits that in the instant case the F.I.R. was lodged without any proper sanction and the sanction accorded before submission of the charge sheet is absolutely a mechanical sanction and being contrary to the law, the very initiation of the instant proceeding is barred by law. In support of the argument on point of sanction Mr. Ali relies upon the case of <em>Sheikh Hasina</em> 63 DLR 40 (supra, which is the NIKO case) and the case of <strong><em>Sheikh Hasina Wazed alias Sheikh Hasina vs. State</em></strong> and another 63 DLR 162 (commonly known as ‘Barge Mounted Power Plants case’).<br/> <br/>Mr. Ali lastly submits that ACC has filed the case against the petitioner with a malafide intention and with an ulterior motive to harass and humiliate her.<br/> <br/>Mr. Md. Khurshid  Alam Khan, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent no. 1 ACC, on the contrary, rebutting the submissions of Mr. Ali submits that the petitioner has been implicated in the instant case not as Prime Minister, but as Minister-in-Charge of the concerned Ministry and there are allegations of committing criminal misconduct against the petitioner and others.<br/> <br/>Mr. Khan submits that so far as sanction under section 32 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 is concerned, it is now settled through judicial pronouncement both by the High Court Division and the Appellate Division that no sanction is required to file a complaint either with the ACC or with the police. Only one sanction is required under the section before taking cognizance of the offence by the Special Judge. The sanction is accorded in prescribed ‘Form-3’ and it need not be a speaking one. The learned Advocate refers to the cases of <strong><em>Habibur Rahman Molla vs. State</em></strong> 61 DLR 1; <strong><em>Habibur Rahman Mollah vs. State and another</em></strong> 62 DLR (AD) 233; <strong><em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs. Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and others </em></strong>62 DLR (AD) 290; <strong><em>SM Zafarullah vs. Durniti Daman Commission and others </em></strong>20 BLC 311. The learned Advocate argues that in the instant case sanction accorded by the ACC is proper and legal.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate for ACC next submits that it is also now settled principle of law that there is no scope for quashing a criminal proceeding under the writ jurisdiction unless the vires of law involved in the case is challenged. The learned Advocate refers to the cases of <strong><em>Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and others vs. Iqbal Hasan Mahmood alias Iqbal Hasan Mahmood Tuku </em></strong>60 DLR (AD) 147; <strong><em>Anti-Corruption Commission and another vs. Md. Enayetur Rahman and others </em></strong> 16 MLR (AD) 297; <strong><em>SM Zafarullah </em></strong>20 BLC 311 (supra); <strong><em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs. Mehedi Hasan and another </em></strong>67 DLR (AD) 137. The learned Advocate argues that in the instant case, the vires of law has not been challenged and therefore, the writ petition, in which the petitioner seeks to quash the criminal proceeding, is not maintainable, and as such, the Rule is liable to be discharged.<br/> <br/>The learned Advocate lastly submits that facts of the instant case and those of the case of <strong><em>Sheikh Hasina </em></strong>63 DLR 40 (‘NIKO’ case, supra) are not same, rather different. In the instant case there are allegations against some of the accused persons that they accepted bribe to ensure that the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) is to be finalized and executed. The petitioner’s involvement as Minister-in-Charge in the said illegal monetary transaction can only be determined during the trial after taking evidences. Mr. Khan further argues that there are other specific allegations against the petitioner which prima facie attract the definition of criminal misconduct and also come within the ambit of abettor under section 109 of the Penal Code.<br/> <br/>So far as maintainability of writ petition is concerned, Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, places before us the case of <strong><em>Nesar Ahmed vs. Bangladesh and another </em></strong>49 DLR (AD) 111 and submits that in the facts, circumstances and the unique as well as distinctive features of the instant case, which he has already outlined, writ petition is maintainable.<br/> <br/>It appears from the arguments of the learned Advocates of both sides that the case involves both question of law and facts. First, we shall deal with the question of law and then, the question of facts.<br/> <br/>The certified copy of the sanction given by the ACC vide memo no. ¢p/159-2009 (ac¿¹-2)/6805 dated 30.04.2008 to submit the charge sheet has been annexed in the supplementary affidavit (Annexure-E1). The relevant portion of the said sanction runs thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“বিষয়ঃ চার্জশীট দাখিলের অনুমোদন জ্ঞাপন<br/>সূত্রঃ তেজগাঁও থানা মামলা নং-২০, তারিখঃ ০৯-১২-০৭ খ্রিঃ<br/>ধারাঃ ১৯৪৭ সনের দূর্নীতি প্রতিরোধ আইনের ৫(২) ধারা এবং দন্ডবিধির ১০৯ ধারা<br/>তদকারী কর্মকর্তা কর্তৃক দাখিলকৃত সাক্ষ্য স্মারক ও অন্যান্য রেকর্ড পত্র পর্যালোচনা করিয়া দূর্নীতি দমন কমিশন পরিতুষ্ট হইয়া দূর্নীতি দমন কমিশন আইন, ২০০৪ এর ৩২ ধারা এবং দূর্নীতি দমন কমিশন বিধিমালা, ২০০৭ এর বিধি ১৫-এর উপ-বিধি-১ প্রদত্ত ক্ষমতা বলে নিম্নোক্ত ব্যক্তিদের বির্রদ্ধে নিম্নোক্ত ধারায় চার্জশীট দাখিলের অনুমোদন জ্ঞাপন করা হইলঃ</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It appears that in the instant case the sanction has been given in the prescribed ‘Form-3’ under rule 15(7) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rules, 2007 (in short ACC Rules, 2007). In the case of <strong><em>Habibur Rahman Molla </em></strong>61 DLR 1 the High Court Division held that sanction under section 32 of the ACC Act, 2004 is to be given in Form No. 3 under rule 15(7) of the ACC Rules, 2007 which has been prescribed by the legislature. ‘Form-3’ is a part of the statute and accordingly, when a specified form is prescribed in the statute for a particular purpose, the sanctioning authority has no scope to assign any reason of its satisfaction beyond the said format given in the form. The judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division which has been reported in 62 DLR (AD) 233.<br/> <br/>Section 32 of the ACC Act, 2004 was amended by Ordinance No. VII of 2007, which came into effect on 18<sup>th</sup> April, 2007 wherein it has been enacted in the section 32 of the said Act that one sanction is required to proceed with the case at the time of filing of the police report before the Court of Special Judge.<br/> <br/>In the instant case the F.I.R. was lodged on 09.12.2007. So, the amended section 32 applies to the present case. In respect of the amended section 32 it was held in the case of <strong><em>Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir </em></strong>62 DLR (AD) 290 at para 29 that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“Under the above amended section, after completion of the investigation, the investigating officer, under sub-section (2) of section 32, on obtaining the sanction from the Commission, would submit the police report before the Court along with a copy of the letter of sanction. The Court, under sub-section (1), would take cognizance, only when there is such sanction from the Commission. Both the sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of the section 32 envisages only one sanction, not two. Sub-section (1) does not spell out or even envisage filing of any fresh sanction when the sanction to prosecute has already been filed along with the charge sheet of the investigating officer. It only envisages that without such sanction from the Commission <strong>(কমিশনের অনুমোদন ব্যতিরেকে)</strong> as spelt out in sub-section (2), no Court shall take cognizance of the offence <strong>(কোন আদালত এই আইনের অধীন কোন অপরাধ বিচারার্থ আমলে গ্রহণ করিবে না)</strong> under sub-section (1) of section 32.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Same view was expressed in the case of <strong><em>Anti-Corruption Commission vs. Md. Bayazid and others</em></strong> 65 DLR (AD) 97.<br/> <br/>On point of sanction the learned Advocate for the petitioner relies upon the cases of <strong><em>Sheikh Hasina </em></strong>63 DLR 40 (NIKO case) and <strong><em>Sheikh Hasina </em></strong>63 DLR 162 (Barge Mounted Power Plants case) wherein it was held by the High Court Division that sanction given before submission of charge sheet being mechanical and contrary to law and decisions of this Court, the cognizance taken by the Court on such charge sheet is illegal and the proceeding itself is barred by law. The learned Advocate submits that no appeal was preferred against the judgments passed in those cases and therefore, the judgments stand as good law on point of sanction and the issue as to sanction should be decided in line with these two reported cases.<br/> <br/>The above argument of the learned Advocate for the petitioner on point of sanction in light of the reported cases of 63 DLR 40 and 63 DLR 162 is devoid of any substance. In those cases the petitioner namely Sheikh Hasina invoked the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The judgments were given on 11.03.2010 (NIKO case) and 13.04.2010 (Barge Mounted case) respectively. The case of <strong><em>Habibur Rahman Molla</em></strong> was decided by the High Court Division on 20.11.2008 and was reported in 61 DLR (2009). Against the said judgment, the petitioner Habibur Rahman Molla preferred appeal and the Appellate Division granted leave to appeal. The Appellate Division affirmed the judgment of the High Court Division vide judgment dated 04.04.2010. Mr. Md. Khurshid Alam Khan was the lawyer for ACC in all the cases <em>i.e.</em>, the cases of <em>Sheikh Hasina</em> (both NIKO and Barge Mounted case), and the case of <em>Habibur Rahman Molla</em> (both at the High Court Division and the Appellate Division). Mr. Khan submits that although the Appellate Division decided the case of <em>Habibur Rahman Molla</em> on 04.04.2010, but the full text of the judgment was not available, and as such, he could not refer it in the case of <em>Sheikh Hasina</em> (Barge Mounted case) which was decided on 13.04.2010. He further submits that since the Appellate Division granted leave to appeal against the judgment passed by the High Court Division in the case of <em>Habibur Rahman Molla</em>, the same was not also referred to in <em>Sheikh Hasina’s</em> cases. The case of <em>Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir </em>reported in 62 DLR (AD) 290 was decided subsequently on 04.07.2010.<br/> <br/>Upon a close scrutiny of the reported cases on question of sanction, it appears to us that during the period when the cases of <em>Sheikh Hasina</em> (both NIKO and Barge Mounted cases) were decided, the High Court Division, except in the case of <em>Habibur Rahman Molla</em>, took the view that two sanctions are required under section 32 of the ACC Act, 2004, and that the sanction before submitting the charge sheet has to be a speaking one based on reason, not mere mechanical. This was the prevailing view and <em>Sheikh Hasina’s</em> cases were decided accordingly. We have already noted that subsequently, law on point of sanction has been settled by the Appellate Division in series of cases to the effect that under the amended section 32 of the ACC Act, 2004 one sanction is required before submitting the charge sheet and it will be given in ‘Form-3’ of the schedule to the ACC Rules, 2007. It need not be a speaking one. In facts and circumstances of the instant case we find no reason to deviate from the settled principle on the issue of sanction. Moreover, under Article 111 of the Constitution the law declared by the Appellate Division is binding on the High Court Division. In view of this position of law we hold that the sanction given in the instant case does not suffer from any legal infirmity and has been given in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>Now, we turn to the issue as to maintainability of the writ petition. The decisions of the Appellate Division cited by Mr. Md. Khurshid Alam Khan on point of maintainability show that by now, it has become trite law that except in cases where vires of law involved in the case is challenged, or filing an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not an adequate alternative remedy as contemplated under Article 102(2) of the Constitution, or when it becomes impossible to avail of the alternative statutory remedy, or when the question of law and interpretation of statute is involved in the case, there is no scope for the High Court Division in exercise of its special original jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution to quash a criminal proceeding.<br/> <br/>In <strong><em>Iqbal Hasan Mahmood</em></strong> 60 DLR (AD) 147 (supra), a case under sections 165 and 166 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984, the Appellate Division referred to the cases of <em>Jahangir Hossain Howlader </em>58 DLR 106; <em>MA Hai vs. TCB</em> 40 DLR (AD) 206 and <em>Nesar Ahmed vs. Bangladesh</em> 49 DLR (AD) 111 and vide judgment dated 20.05.2008 held that since the writ petition has raised question of law and interpretation of statute and further, the accused-petitioner had no other efficacious alternative remedy under the Income Tax Ordinance to challenge the criminal case now pending against him, the writ petition is maintainable.<br/> <br/>In <strong><em>Md. Enayetur Rahman </em></strong>16 MLR (AD) 297, a case under sections 409/420 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with section 156 of the Customs Act, the Appellate Division vide judgment dated 28.02.2011 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“The exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction by the High Court Division to examine the legality of a criminal proceedings initiated under the general laws is deprecated.… The High Court Division’s power under writ jurisdiction to quash criminal proceedings should be exercised sparingly in rarest cases. On perusal of the impugned judgment we noticed that the High Court Division in fact exercised its power under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the garb of a writ jurisdiction…. This Court on repeated occasions argued that Article 102(2) of the Constitution is not meant to circumvent the statutory procedures. The High Court Division will not allow a litigant to invoke the extra ordinary jurisdiction to be converted into Courts of appeal or revision. It is only where statutory remedies are entirely ill suited to meet the demands of extra-ordinary situations, that is to say, where vires of a statute is in question or where the determination is malafide or where any action is taken by the executives in contravention of the principles of natural justice or where the fundamental right of a citizen has been affected by an act, or where the statute is intra vires but the action taken is without jurisdiction and the vindication of public justice require that recourse may be had to Article 102(2) of the Constitution.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In <strong><em>Mehedi Hasan and another </em></strong>67 DLR (AD) 137, cases under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, the issue as to maintainability of writ petition again cropped up. The Appellate Division vide judgment dated 11.02.2015 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“…there is no scope for quashing a criminal proceeding under the writ jurisdiction unless the vires of the law involved is challenged. Having gone through the Rule issuing order, we find that the vires of the law involved in the present case has not been challenged. Therefore, there is no scope for aggrandizement of jurisdiction of the High Court Division in quashing a criminal proceeding. Consequently, the High Court Division was not justified in quashing 15 criminal cases (Special Case Nos. 12-26 of 2007) in exercise of its power under Article 102 of the Constitution.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The case of <strong><em>Nesar Ahmed</em></strong> 49 DLR (AD) 111 (referred to in <em>Iqbal Hasan Mahmood’s </em>case (supra)) has been relied upon by Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, in support of his contention submits that the instant writ petition is maintainable.<br/> <br/>In this case the appellant Nesar Ahmed and another were convicted under section 19(f) of the Arms Act read with section 26 of the Special Powers Act. The appellant had no reasonable opportunity to avail of the statutory remedy by way of filing an appeal under section 30 of the Special Powers Act. Challenging the judgment and order of conviction and sentence, he filed an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the High Court Division and this Court observed that the application was not maintainable and the same was taken back. Then the appellant filed a writ petition which was rejected <em>in limine.</em> The appellant preferred leave to appeal before the Appellate Division and leave was granted. Ultimately, the appeal was allowed and impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence was set aside on the ground that the Special Tribunal had no jurisdiction to try the case.<br/> <br/>In this case it was held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“It is free from any doubt that when an equally efficacious alternative statutory remedy is provided for in section 30 of the Special Powers Act enabling the accused to prefer an appeal to the High Court Division the question of invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution normally does not arise.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It has further been held in this case that,<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“Upon satisfying itself that the accused person had no reasonable opportunity to avail of the statutory remedy, the High Court Division however, in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution, will not sit on appeal over the judgment of the Special Tribunal and will not convert itself into a Court of Appeal under section 30 of the Special Powers Act. It will confine itself to the jurisdictional issues that are usually associated with judgments of inferior Tribunals and quasi-judicial bodies.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Upon re-visit of the Rule issuing order dated 09.07.2008 passed in the instant case and order dated 17.07.2008 which have been set out at the beginning of this judgment, it appears that the vires of the law has not been challenged in the writ petition. There is no assertion in the writ petition that the statutory relief under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure was ever sought to agitate the grievances. Surprisingly, there is no statement in the writ petition to the effect that the petitioner is constrained to file the writ petition because of either the absence of or inadequacy of equally efficacious alternative statutory remedy.<br/> <br/>However, in the affidavit –in-reply dated 31.05.2015 filed by the petitioner it has been stated at paragraph No. 6 that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“The petitioner had to file the instant writ petition under an exceptional circumstance finding no other alternative equally efficacious remedy. Moreover, after lapse of eight years of issuance of the Rule, the instant writ petition should not be thrown out by this Hon’ble Court merely on technical grounds for ends of justice. Furthermore, the instant writ petition raises substantial questions of law which call for authoritative pronouncement form the High Court Division of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in relation to interplay between governmental functions and criminal prosecution under prevention of Corruption Act, especially in cases where there is not even a whiff, let alone an allegation, of <em>quid pro quo </em>and the case is based upon the process of governmental decisions.”  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>However, to address the above point as stated in Para 6 of the reply, the Rule issuing order is quoted below for ready reference:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“Let a Rule issue calling upon the Opposite party to show cause as to why the proceeding of Special Case No. 16 of 2008 arising out of Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 20 dated 09.12.2007 corresponding to A.C.C. General Registered Case No. 161 of 07, now pending in the Court of Special Judge, Court No. 9, Dhaka should not be declared unlawful, without jurisdiction and quashed and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The point raised in the reply is not reflected in the Rule, rather, it appears from a plain reading of the Rule that the petitioner has prayed for quashing the criminal proceeding. While adjudicating the matter in exercise of writ jurisdiction,   we have to strictly follow the terms of the Rule issuing order according to the principle enunciated by the apex Court in the case of <strong><em>Secretary, Ministry of Establishment and others –Vs- Amzad Hossain and others</em></strong> reported in 18 BLC (AD)16 which is as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“The prayer to the effect “and/or such other or further order or orders as your Lordships may deem fit and proper” do not authorize a writ Court to give relief beyond the Rule issuing order, such prayer authorizes the writ Court to give any incidental relief or reliefs which may follow from the main relief according the Rule issuing order.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>More so, Mr. Ali argues that the case against the petitioner is nothing but malafide. However, upon meticulous scrutiny of the prosecution case and charge sheet it clearly appears that it is not a case of malafide, rather, certain accusation allegedly against the petitioner in respect of using her official capacity to have the contract materialized for the benefit of others has been brought and this factual aspect cannot be resolved in writ jurisdiction. In view of the facts and circumstances of the instant case and case laws discussed above on point of maintainability being binding upon this Division according to the Article 111 of the Constitution, the irresistible conclusion is that the instant writ petition is not maintainable.<br/> <br/>Mr. A. J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, in a passionate manner urges before us to consider his submission that since facts of the case of <strong><em>Sheikh Hasina </em></strong>63 DLR 40 (NIKO case) and those of the present case, so far as it relates to the petitioner, are same; the petitioner stands on the same footing as that of the erstwhile Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina; and since the criminal proceeding against Sheikh Hasina has been quashed, the fate of the present petitioner should be the same as that of Sheikh Hasina. The learned Advocate submits that against the backdrop of this unique and distinctive feature of the case and other issues regarding interpretation of some provisions of the Constitution raised in the affidavit-in-reply, it would be improper, inequitable and a denial of justice if the door is shut upon the face of the petitioner on ground of maintainability issue without considering the merit of the case as well as the other legal issues.<br/> <br/>It appears that the petitioner before us as Minister-in-Charge of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on 18.03.2003 approved a summary by which Chatak gas field was considered to be treated as was defined in Exhibit-A of the Framework of Understanding (FOU) which was signed on 23.08.1999 between BAPEX and NIKO during the era of the erstwhile Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Vide the said summary, the petitioner also gave approval to finalize the draft Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) as per terms and conditions laid down in the ‘Procedure for Development of Marginal Abandoned Gas Fields’ which was approved on 16.04.2001 by the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and also by following the relevant rules. JVA was signed on 16.10.2003. It further appears from the charge sheet that there was no policy or guideline to conclude the JVA with foreign company in respect of exploration and extraction of gas and oil in Bangladesh. Even no model JVA was framed yet. Had this been the only and the entire prosecution case, we would have concluded that the petitioner had followed the footsteps of the erstwhile Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and thus, facts of both the cases are same.<br/> <br/>However, facts narrated above are neither the only nor the entire part of the prosecution case.<br/>In the charge sheet, it has been stated that the F.I.R. accused no. 5 Kashem Sharif, who was the then Vice President (South Asia) of NIKO Resources Ltd., engaged Selim Bhuiyan, the then Chairman of Dhaka Club to maintain liaison with A.K.M. Mosarraf Hossain the then State Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry and Gias Uddin Al Mamun who was the friend of the petitioner’s influential son Tarique Rahman. For this purpose Selim Bhuiyan was given Taka 3 (three) crore. On 15.01.2008 Selim Bhuiyan made a judicial confession before the Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate which was recorded under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the said confession he stated that he had contact with Gias Uddin Al Mamun and both of them met the State Minister A.K.M. Mosarraf Hossain and solicited his assistance to get NIKO the work. The State Minister assured him that he would try his best. Selim Bhuiyan and Gias Uddin Al Mamun used to maintain regular contact with the State Minister and follow up the matter. As a result of lengthy negotiations the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was signed between BAPEX and NIKO at the end of 2003. Kashem Sharif deposited Taka 3 (three) crore in the Standard Chartered Bank account of Selim Bhuiyan. Out of that money Selim Bhuiyan gave Gias Uddin Al Mamun Taka 1 (one) crore 80 (eight) lac and Taka 60 (sixty) lac to the State Minister. The confession of Selim Bhuiyan has not been produced before us.<br/> <br/>It has been stated in the F.I.R. that on 15.08.2005 a 3-member inquiry committee headed by a Director General of the Office of the Prime Minister was formed to enquire into the matters relating to the basis of declaration of Chatak gas field as abandoned and the process of approval of the JVA between BAPEX and NIKO and other related matters. In the said enquiry report various irregularities and commission of corruption in the process leading to approval given to sign the JVA were highlighted. A summary was sent to the petitioner, who was the Prime Minister at that time, for according approval to take legal action as per the report of the inquiry committee and to send the report to the ACC, but the Prime Minister (the petitioner) sent back the file with instruction not to send the report and relevant files to the ACC.<br/> <br/>So far as the erstwhile Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is concerned, there is no such allegation that the process of approving the ‘procedure’ by her involves any unlawful financial or other transaction. The only allegation against her is that she approved the ‘procedure’ which, the High Court Division in her case held, does not attract any criminal liability. In the instant case it appears from the confession of the co-accused that bribe was given to the then State Minister of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources A.K.M. Mosarraf Hossain, Selim Bhuiyan and Gias Uddin Al Mamun to ensure that the ‘JVA’ is to be finalized and signed which clearly comes within the ambit of definition of criminal misconduct given in section 5(1) of the Act, 1947. The involvement of the petitioner as an abettor in the alleged offence as Minister-in-Charge of Energy and Mineral Resources is a question of fact which cannot be determined at this stage. We also note that the petitioner as Prime Minister refused to give approval to take legal action as per inquiry report prepared by a committee headed by a Director General of the office of the Prime Minister in respect of corruption indulged in the process leading to signing the JVA and to send the report to the ACC.<br/> <br/>So, it is not the question of approving the ‘procedure’ as approved by the erstwhile Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina or the draft JVA by the petitioner as Minister-in-Charge, rather the issue is determination of criminal liability of the accused persons of the instant case in the alleged offence of giving and receiving bribe which is absent in the case of Sheikh Hasina. These factual aspects clearly show that the cases of Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia (the petitioner) are not the same.<br/> <br/>The case of Sheikh Hasina (in which the proceeding of Special Case No. 5 of 2008 arising out of Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 19 dated 09.12.2007 corresponding to ACC G.R. Case No. 160 of 2007 was challenged) was decided upon an application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, whereas the petitioner seeks to quash the criminal proceeding Special Case No. 16 of 2008 arising out of Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 20 dated 09.12.2007 corresponding to A.C.C. General Registered Case No. 161/07 by making an application under Article 102 of the Constitution, which we have already held, is not maintainable.<br/> <br/>It has been argued on behalf of the petitioner by making reference to Articles 55(2) and 145(2) of the Constitution that inasmuch as contract made or executed in exercise of the executive authority of the Republic, neither the President nor any other person making or executing the contract in exercise of that authority is personally liable in respect thereof, ACC has no authority under section 17 of the ACC Act, 2004 to enquire into the acts of the Prime Minister or the Cabinet in taking an executive decision in performance of their functions of the Republic.<br/> <br/>We do not find any substance in the above argument because of the language employed in Article 145(2) which clearly suggests that the Article applies to matters of civil liability, not in the case of criminal liability. We have already held that in the instant case the issue is determination of criminal liability of the petitioner in respect of the alleged offence under sections 409/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of the Act, 1947 <em>i.e</em>., criminal breach of trust by public servant, criminal misconduct by a public servant and abetment of the offence that took place in the process of executing the ‘JVA’.<br/> <br/>More-so, section 17 of ACC Act, 2004 provides inter alia that-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“১৭ কমিশনের কার্যাবলি- কমিশন নিম্নবর্ণিত সকল বা যে কোন কার্য সম্পাদন করিতে পারিবে, যথাঃ-<br/>(ক) তফসিলে উল্লিখিত অপরাধসমূহের অনুসন্ধান ও তদন্ত পরিচালনা;<br/>অনুচ্ছেদ (ক) এর অধীন অনুসন্ধান ও তদন্ত পরিচালনার ভিত্তিতে এই আইনের অধীন মামলা দায়ের ও পরিচালনা;”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Constitution has not given any immunity to the Prime Minister or the Cabinet in respect of any criminal offence. There is neither any constitutional nor any statutory or legal bar on the ACC to conduct an enquiry in respect of allegation of commission of offence mentioned in the schedule to the ACC Act, 2004. Therefore, ACC is legally empowered under section 17 of Act, 2004 to conduct any enquiry, the subject matter of which may fall under Article 145 of the Constitution, so long as it attracts criminal liability and ACC acts within the ambit of law.<br/> <br/>It has also been argued that the Prime Minister is not a public servant and hence, cannot be prosecuted under section 5(2) of the Act, 1947. Upon perusal of section 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 (in short ‘Act, 1958’) and the schedule to the Act we do not find any relevancy in the argument.<br/> <br/>Section 5(1) of the Act, 1958 states, “Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, or in any other law, the offences specified in the Schedule shall be triable exclusively by a Special Judge.”<br/> <br/>The relevant portion of the schedule to the Act, 1958 runs thus:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"> </div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;">“Schedule<br/>(See section 5)<br/>“(a)      Offences punishable under দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশন আইন, ২০০৪;<br/>…<br/>Offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947;<br/>…<br/>Abetment described in section 109 including other abetments, … of the Penal Code, 1860 related to or connected with the offences mentioned in clause (a) to (c) above.”<br/>The relevant portion of the schedule to the দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশন আইন, ২০০৪ (ACC Act, 2004) states:<br/>“তফসিল<br/>[(ধারা ১৭(ক) দ্রষ্টব্য]<br/>এই আইনের অধীন অপরাধসমূহ;<br/>the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 1947) এর অধীন শাস্তিযোগ্য অপরাধসমূহ;<br/>...<br/>the Penal Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860) এর sections 161-169, 217, 218, 408, 409 and 477A এর অধীন শাস্তিযোগ্য অপরাধসমূহঃ<br/>অনুচ্ছেদ (ক) হইতে (গ) তে বর্ণিত অপরাধসমূহের সহিত সংশ্লিষ্ট বা সম্পৃক্ত the Penal Code, 1860 (act XLV of 1860) এর section 109 এ বর্ণিত সহায়তাসহ অন্যান্য সহায়তা, ... অপরাধসমূহ”</div><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">The charge sheet of the present case was submitted against the petitioner and 10 others including the State Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources A.K.M. Mosarraf Hossain, the maker of judicial confession Selim Bhuiyan, Gias Uddin Al Mamun, the then Vice-President (South Asia) of NIKO Kashem Sharif. Cognizance of the offence has been taken by the Special Judge against the petitioner, former State Minister and others some of whom were admittedly public servant during the commission of the alleged offence. According to the ratio laid down at paragraph 31 in the case of <em>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman </em>(supra) a State Minister, no doubt, is a public servant within the meaning of Act, 1947 read with Act, 1958. Under section 5(1) of the Act, 1958, which has been quoted above, offences specified in the schedule to the Act are exclusively triable by the Special Judge.<br/> <br/>In the case of <strong><em>Hossain Mohammed Ershad, former President and others vs. State</em></strong> 45 DLR (AD) 48 it has been held that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“Though the offence of abetment was not mentioned in Act II of 1947 it was mentioned as an item in the schedule ‘C’ to the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. Under section 5 of the Act that the special Judge, appointed under the Act, has jurisdiction to try that offence. Besides where the prosecution case is that the offences were committed in the course of the same transaction all the accused who were alleged to have committed the offence as principals and abettors in the course of the alleged transaction can be tried under section 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Against the backdrop of the above provisions of law and facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that in the instant case the allegation against the petitioner that she otherwise abused her office or abetted others to use the office for any illegal gain within the meaning of criminal misconduct as defined in section 5(1) of the Act, 1947 or her alleged involvement as an abettor under section 109 of the Penal Code cannot be determined in a separate criminal proceeding and the same must be adjudicated in the instant proceeding by the Special Judge appointed under section 5 of the Act, 1958. Abetment under section 109 of the Penal Code is such an offence which can be inferred from the conduct of the accused and attending circumstances of the case. It may be proved either by oral, or documentary or circumstantial evidence. So, the issue as to whether the Prime Minister is the public servant is irrelevant in the instant case inasmuch as section 109 of the Penal Code (abetment of the offence) is present in the case and other public servants are also accused in the case.<br/> <br/>Facts and circumstances of the case of <strong><em>Begum Khaleda Zia </em></strong>55 DLR 596 (supra) are totally different from those of the instant case and hence does not apply to the case in hand.<br/> <br/>In view of the facts, circumstances and laws discussed above, we do not find any merit in Rule.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged. The order of stay is re-called and vacated. However, there is no order as to cost.<br/><br/>It appears that pending disposal of the Rule, the petitioner was granted bail on 09.09.2008 which was extended till disposal of Rule vide order dated 24.11.2008. Since the Rule is discharged the petitioner is directed to surrender before the trial court within a period of 2(two) months from the date of receipt of this judgment. The trial court shall consider the bail of the petitioner, if any, as she did not misuse the privilege of bail.<br/> <br/>Send down the lower Court records and communicate the judgment to the court concern at once.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Their case, in short, is that Sailendra Kumar Purskaystua was the owner of the suit land and by taking settlement from him Shayama Barayek became owner of the said land and while in possession, said Shayama Barayek died leaving behind two sons, namely, Ruhi Das Barayek, predecessor of the defendant Nos. 8-10 and Bad Barayek, predecessor of the defendant Nos.11. The S.A. Khatian having been prepared in the name of Ruhi Das Barayek only Bad Barayek got an order of correction of the S.A khatian in Miscellaneous Case No.96 of 1961 filed under section 19 (1) of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 in respect of his 8 annas share. Then Bad Barayek by a registered deed of sale dated 08.09.1998 sold 3.31½ acres of land to the plaintiff Nos.1,5-10 and also to Abdul Khaleque, the predecessor of the plaintiff Nos. 2-4. Ruhi Das Barayek left three sons, defendant Nos. 8, 9 and Chunu Barayek, father of defendant No.10. Defendant Nos.9 and 10 by registered deed of sale dated  04.07.1979 sold 1.35½ acres of land to plaintiff Nos.1 and 5-10 and defendant No.10 sold 10 decimals of land to  plaintiff Nos.1 and 3-10. Defendant Nos.8 and 9 executed registered Nadabinama dated 07.07.1978 in favour of plaintiff Nos. 1 and 5-10. Defendant No.8 in collusion with defendant Nos.1-7 created some collusive documents for which it became necessary to partition  the suit land according to share of the parties but the defendants, in spite of requests, did not pay any heed to the requests for partition. Hence the plaintiffs were constrained to file the title suit for partition of 8.43 acres of land as described in the schedule to the plaint. <br/><br/>Defendant Nos.1, 5-7 and 12 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the material statements made in the plaint. Their case, in short, is that the plaintiffs did not acquire any share in the suit land by purchase and that Sailendra, the original owner of the suit properties, settled the suit land to Ruhi Das Barayek in the years 1350 and 1360 B.S. and Bad Barayek had no share in the suit land. On 8.7.1975, Ruhi Das Barayek sold 75 decimals of land to defendant No.1 and on the death of Ruhi Das Barayek, his sons, defendant Nos. 8 and 9, sold 75 decimals of land on 06.06.1978 and also 75 decimal of land on 21.01.1979 to defendant No.1. They also sold 75 decimals of land to defendant No.2, who in his turn sold the same to defendant No.12. Defendant No.8 further sold 30 decimals of land on 27.10.79 to defendant No.5 and he also sold 2 kaders of land on 16.10.1079 to defendant Nos. 6-7.<br/><br/>The defendant No.31 also filed written statement and admitted settlement of the suit land in favour of Shayama Barayek as claimed by the plaintiffs but contended, inter alia, that on 01.04.1975 Ruhi Das Barayek entered into an agreement with him to sell 3.36 acres of land for Tk. 10,000/-. Later defendant No.31 executed ekarnama in favour of Ruhi Das stating that if Ruhi Das Barayek repaid the said amount within 8 years he would surrender the agreement of sale in favour of Ruhi Das Barayek, failing which, Ruhi Das Barayek would have to execute a deed of conveyance. Accordingly, on the death of Ruhi Das Barayek, his heirs and successors executed a registered deed of sale dated 22.o7.1984 in favour of defendant No.1 and he is in possession of those lands. However, ultimately the above defendant No.31 did not contest the suit. Defendant Nos.8 and 9 also filed Title Suit No. 311 of 1989, which was subsequently renumbered as Title Suit No.72 of 1994, praying for declaration that Nadabinama dated 07.07.1978 is illegal and the above suit was heard analog-ously along with Title Suit No. 71 of 1994.<br/><br/>The learned Assistant Judge, after hearing, by judgment and order dated 30.05.96 decreed Title Suit No.71 of 1994 in part granting the plaintiffs saham to the extent of only 1.48½ acres of land and dismissed Title Suit No. 72 of 1994.<br/><br/>The plaintiffs of Title Suit No.71 of 1994 then preferred Title Appeal No.110 of 1996 praying for full saham of 4.77 acres of land as claimed by them in their suit whereupon the defendants of the above suit filed cross objection. The plaintiffs of Title Suit No. 72 of 1994 also preferred Title Appeal No. 124 of 1996. Thereafter, in the above Appeal No. 110 of 1996, respondent Nos. 1 and 17 jointly submitted one compromise petition and respondent Nos. 6 and 7 submitted another compromise petition jointly with the plaintiffs and those were accepted by the order dated 08.10.1997. Respondent Nos.33 and 35 submitted separate applications to contest the above appeal but then respondent No. 35 prayed for separate saham on payment of court fee of Tk.100/-. Then after close of the argument in the above Title Appeal No. 110 of 1996, respondent No.33 on 19.10.1997 filed an application under Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for allowing him to adduce additional evidence. The learned Subordinate Judge (now Joint District Judge), Third Court, Sylhet, by judgment and order dated 20.10.97 allowed Title Appeal No.110 of 1996 in terms of the compromise against respondent Nos.1,6,7 and 17 and on contest against the contesting respondents and   <em>ex parte</em> against the rest granting the plaintiffs full saham of 4.77 acres of land.<br/>Thereafter, Abdul Malik alias Mohimuddin, non-contesting defendant No.29 in Title Suit No.71 of 1994 and respondent No.1 herein moved the High Court Division against the above judgment and decree dated 20.10.97 and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 4670 of 1997 and similarly non contesting defendant No.31 also moved the High Court Division and obtained Rule in Civil Revision No. 556 of 1998. The learned Single Judge of the High Court Division by the judgment and order dated 09.04.2003 made the Rules absolute sending the suit back to the trial court for fresh trial.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the leave petitioners filed Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal No.1234-1235 of 2003 before this Division and obtained leave in both the civil petitions on 22.08.2005 resulting in Civil Appeal Nos.3-4 of 2006.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellants in both the appeals, submits that the High Court Division remanded the suit to the trial Court although the order of remand does not come within the purview of Order XLI Rule 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure and as such, the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division should be interfered with. He further submits that remand cannot be given for filling up the lacuna of the case of defendant-respondent No.33 of Civil Revision No.4670 of 1997 and defendant Nos.35 of Civil Revision No.556 of 1988 to adduce evidence in respect of the suit property and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside.<br/><br/>Mr. Abdul Halim Chalader, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 in both the appeals, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment and submits that the application for additional evidence which was filed under Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not disposed of by the trial Court and as such, the High Court Division rightly remanded the suit to the trial Court.<br/><br/>Mr. Syed Mahbubur Rahman, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.2 (a-g) in both the appeals, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the sides, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/><br/>The grounds, on which, leave was granted, are quoted below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“The High Court Division erred in law in making the Rules absolute and sending 24 years old suits to the trial court for fresh hearing on mere asking of the respondents in the High Court Division at revisional stage without at all appreciating that a partition suit remains pending till passing of the final decree and remedy of the respondents lie in making prayer for saham in the trial court by production of documents and that provisions of Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not at all applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case and that there is no finding that of the High Court Division to the effect that the judgment and decree dated 20.10.97 of the appellate Court is liable to be set aside for misreading or non reading of evidence or non consideration of materials on record or any other infirmity and that revisional applications were filed by the non contesting parties solely to delay the case and thereby to defeat justice and that the High Court Division committed error of law in failing to consider that it has no jurisdiction to do “complete justice” and it is only the Appellate Division, which has jurisdiction to do so under Article 104 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The High Court Division came to a finding that defendant-respondent No.33 (the petitioner of Civil Revision No.4670 of 1997) was not aware of the suit and that at the relevant time he was abroad and after returning home he came to know of the appeal and filed an application under Order XLI Rule 27 of the of the Code of Civil Procedure and that the Court did not pass any order on that application. The High Court Division noticed that the appellate Court came to a finding that defendant-respondent No.33 could file a cross appeal/cross objection and that the appellate Court could exercise power under Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure for doing complete justice. The High Court Division further found that defendant-respondent No.35 filed written statement but did not contest the suit and also prayed for saham and that the plaintiff compromised with the vendor and had sold some portion of the suit land to the respondent No.33 and that this aspect was not taken into consideration. The High Court Division also observed that for doing complete justice, this matter be sent on remand for affording opportunity to defendant-respondent No.33 (petitioner of Civil Revision No.4670 of 1997) and respondent No.35 (petitioner of Civil Revision No.556 of 1998) to adduce evidence in respect of the suit property for their saham.<br/><br/>The High Court Division, was, however, wrong in holding that the suit was remanded to the trial Court for doing complete justice. Only this Division can do complete justice under Article 104 of the Constitution and not the High Court Division. Having considered all aspects of the case, we find that the order of remand made by the High Court Division was justified as contemplated under Order XLI Rule 33 of the Cod of Civil Procedure.<br/><br/>Accordingly, both the appeals are dismissed.  <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Moazzam Husain, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>This Rule was issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the letter dated 05.12.2012 issued by the Senior Assistant Secretary, Bichar Shakha-7 (Respondent No.2) creating a new jurisdiction of  Nikah Registrar in No.7, Bhadra Union Nagarpur, Tangail in violation of Rule 13(<em>Uma</em>) of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 2009 shall not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>The petitioner is a citizen of Bangladesh having requisite qualifications to be appointed as Nikah Registrar. Father of the petitioner was the Nikah Registrar of the said Bhadra Union No.7, who retired from the said post on 01.01.2008. The post of Nikah Registrar thus fell  vacant on account of retirement of the petitioner’s father. The local Chairman requested the Respondent No.3 for appointment of the petitioner as Nikah Registrar for the said Union. The petitioner having requisite qualifications himself also filed an application to be appointed as such addressing the District Registrar, Tangail on 29.01.2008. <br/><br/>On 22.02.2008 a written examination was held and the result of the said examination was published on 24.02.2008. The petitioner along with others came out successful in the examination. He was entitled to preference over others as per law as a son of the preceding Nikah Registrar of the Union. On 07.02.2008 Respondent No.2 accordingly issued a letter addressing Respondent No.3 recommending the name of the petitioner for appointment as Nikah Registrar. But in total disregard of the said recommendation the Respondent No.6 appointed one Md. Abdul Alim (Res-7) as Nikah Registrar by his office Memo dated 26.02.2008.<br/><br/>The petitioner being aggrieved by the appointment filed Writ Petition No. 2011 of 2008 before the High Court Division and obtained a Rule. The writ petition was heard on 03.03.2010 by a Division Bench of this Division and after hearing the parties their Lordships were pleased to make the Rule absolute with some observation by a judgment and order dated 10.03.2010. The Respondent No.4 of the said writ petition ie, Respondent No.7 of the instant writ petition filed a Leave Petition bearing No. CP No.  1089 of 2010 in the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division after hearing dismissed the leave petition by its order dated 17.11.2011 affirming the judgment and order of the High Court Division. Accordingly the petitioner was appointed as Nikah Registrar for No.7, Bhadra Union, Tangail <em>vide</em> an office Memo dated 29.07.2012 of the Respondent No.2 which was duly published in the official gazette on 29.07.2012.<br/><br/>While the petitioner was performing his duties as Nikah Registrar of No.7,  Bhadra Union  the Ministry of Law  Justice &amp;Parliamentary Affairs all on a sudden issued a letter under the signature of  Respondent No.2 <em>vide</em> his office Memo dated  05.12.2012 creating  a new jurisdiction for another Nikah Registrar  curtailing the  jurisdiction of the petitioner purportedly in exercise of power under Section 4 of the Muslim Marriages &amp; Divorces (Registration) Act, 1947, (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”).<br/><br/>Being aggrieved by the Memo issued by the Ministry the petitioner obtained the instant Rule on different grounds. He raised a number of contentions which practically boil down to three, namely, that the Government is not empowered by Section 4 of the Act to Divide a Union territory for the purpose of creating a new jurisdiction for another Nikah Registrar in that an Union is the minimal territorial unit of a Nikah Registrar as per Rule 13(<em>Uma</em>)   of  the Muslim Marriages &amp; Divorces (Registration) Rules, 2009 (hereinafter called as the “ The Rules”); the Respondent No.7 is not the resident of Ward No. 5,6,7,8 and 9,  therefore, he is not entitled to be appointed as the Nikah Registrar for the newly created  jurisdiction and finally the impugned Memo was issued in colorable exercise of power at the behest of Respondent No. 7 only to accommodate him there not for the interest of the people. He put in two supplementary affidavits to show, <em>inter alia,</em> that there was no proposal or recommendation from the local bodies or administrative unit for creating the new jurisdiction, therefore, the Memo dividing the jurisdiction is tainted with bad faith made for collateral purpose.<br/><br/>Mr. Khurshid Alam Khan, learned Advocate  appearing for the petitioner submits  at the outset that  the Rules were framed under the Act in order to carry out the purpose of the Act and  Rule 13(<em>Uma</em>) of the Rules, 2009, earmarks, amongst others,  an Union as the minimal territorial unit of a Nikah Registrar’s  jurisdiction. It cannot be divided, curtailed or reduced in exercise of power under Section 4 of the Act. Secondly, the power conferred by Section 4 must be used <em>bona fide</em> for public interest  but there no demand raised by the local people or proposal made by the local bodies or administrative unit asking for such division. The petitioner’s Union was divided by the Ministry in colorable exercise of power only to accommodate Respondent No.7 who lost his battle against the petition up to the Appellate Division for the post. He pointed out that indication of undue influence exerted by  Respondent No.7 in matters of issuance of the impugned Memo is  clearly manifested in the impugned Memo itself. The adjacent Unions with similar population and number of marriages, he stressed, are running with one Nikah Registrar each but no such division is brought about in any of them. <br/><br/>Mr. Samarendra Nath Biswas learned Assistant Attorney General  in his bid to defend the Memo submits that   Section 4 of  the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974, empowers  the Government to extend, curtail or otherwise alter the jurisdiction of a Nikah Registrar if and when necessary in the interest of the people  and here Government acted rightly and lawfully in the interest of the people. He found it difficult to answer the question as to whether there was any local demand or proposal   sent to the Ministry asking for any division of the Union for the purpose of creating a new jurisdiction for appointment of another Nikah Registrar or is there any other reasonable basis for taking such a decision where other adjacent Unions are remaining undisturbed in the similar circumstances. Adjournments were allowed to facilitate him in order to meet the queries. He still found to be helpless and devoid of answer.  He, however, stressed upon the power of the Government so to do in the public interest and referred to a  number of cases namely, <em>Mlv Md. Abdul Khurshid Alam v Bangladesh &amp; others</em>, 50 DLR (AD) 82; <em>Maulana Kazi Mohammad Shahabuddin  v Bangladesh &amp; others</em>, 9 MLR 14; <em>Manjurul Haque v Bangladessh &amp; others,</em>  51 DLR 261; <em>Fazlur Rahman v Bangladesh &amp; others</em>, 4 BLC 526 and  <em>Saiful Islam (Md)</em> v <em>Bangladesh &amp; others</em> reported in 66 DLR 310  to demonstrate how  indisputable the power of the  Government is in bringing about specified changes in the jurisdiction of a Nikah Registrar.  <br/><br/>We have gone through every single decision referred to us by the learned Assistant Attorney General. Nowhere is it said that the power under Section 4 may be exercised at will or on request by an interested person or on a DO letter issued by a dignitary having nothing to do with the affairs of the concerned Ministry.  The common strand that runs throughout the judgments is that power of the Government to bring about change in an existing jurisdiction of a Nikah Registrar is there and the Government, in fit circumstances, can extend, curtail or otherwise alter the limits of any area for which a Nikah Registrar has been licensed. Mr. AAG tried to lay stress on Fazlur<em> Rahman</em> (<em>supra</em>) where the Court appears to have seen the power in a wider perspective and  observed that the  Government can so act even without notice to the Nikah Registrar and  neither the principle of natural justice nor the question of vested right can be called in aid to qualify, impair  or circumscribe  the power of the Government in carrying out its duty under law. This is a view which, by no stretch of imagination, can be construed to mean arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of public power by the Government or in similar circumstances by any public authority. Rather <em>Saiful Islam</em> (<em>supra</em>) seems to be representative of the common trend of judicial opinion in which Ruhul Quddus, J, held that the statutory discretion is never absolute and must be exercised within the limit of law set by the standard of reasonableness and fairplay and the change can be brought out only if it is found to be imperative for the interest of the public. In that case the affected Nikah Registrar, his Lordship added,  should be given an opportunity to be heard before the division is effected and, in all fairness, he should be given an option to choose the part of the Union he likes to work for. The argument of the learned AAG seeking to defend the Memo purportedly  issued in public interest failed to lend support from the decisions cited by him rather favors the contention of the petitioner that the same has nothing to with public interest in that nothing is on records  to demonstrate that any requisition or proposal on behalf of the local residents to create a new jurisdiction within the Union was has ever been made from any of the local bodies or local administration upon which the  Memo could reasonably be issued.<br/><br/>Back on records it appears that the impugned Memo was issued by the Ministry of Law, Justice &amp; Parliamentary Affairs on 05.12.2012 under the signature of a Senior Assistant Secretary (Res-2). The language of the Memo may fittingly be quoted:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"> </div><div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: center;">গণপ্রজান্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ সরকার<br/>আইন, বিচার ও সংসদ বিষয়ক মমএনালয়<br/>আইন ও বিচার বিভাগ</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">বিচার শাখা-৭<br/>সরকারী পরিবহন পুল ভবন,<br/>সচিবালয় লিংক রোড, ঢাকা।<br/>নংবিচার-৭/২এন-১৩/২০১২-৮২৬  তারিখঃ ০৫/১২/২০১২ ইং।<br/>বিষয়ঃ টাংগাইল  জেলার নাগরপুর উপজেলার ৭ নং ভাদ্রা ইউনিয়নের ৫,৬,৭,৮ ও ৯নং ওয়ার্ড     সমুহ কর্তনপূর্বক নতুন অধিক্ষেত্র সৃষ্টি এবং উওু অধিক্ষেত্রে নিকাহ রেজিষ্ট্রার নিয়োগ প্রসংগে।<br/>উপর্যুক্ত বিষয়ে নির্দেশিত হয়ে জানানো যাচ্ছে যে, The Muslim Marriage and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974 এর 4 ধারায় প্রদত্ত ক্ষমতাবলে টাংগাইল  জেলার নাগরপুর উপজেলার ৭নং ভাদ্রা ইউনিয়নের ৫,৬,৭,৮ ও ৯ নং ওয়াডসমুহ কর্তনপুর্বক একটি নতুন অধিক্ষেত্র সৃষ্টি করা হলো। উও নতুন অধিক্ষেত্রে নিকাহ রেজিষ্ট্রার নিয়োগের নিমিত্তে বিধি মোতাবেক উপদেষ্টা কমিটি কর্তৃক প্যানেল প্রসওত করে মমএণালয়ে প্রেরণের জন্য আপানাকে বলা হলো। একই সাথে জনাব মোঃ আব্দুল আলিম এর নিকট হতে প্রাপ্ত আবেদন পত্রের ছায়ালিপি প্রেরণপূর্বক বিধি মোতাবেক উহা উপদেষ্টা কমিটিতে উপ্সহাপনের জন্য আপনাকে বলা হলো।<br/>সংযুওু- ১০ পাতা</div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="height:170px; width:488px"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 112px; text-align: justify;"><div style="margin-left: 80px;">প্রাপক,<br/>			সাব-রেজিষ্ট্রার<br/>			নাগরপুর, টাংগাইল।<br/>			 <br/>			 </div></td><td style="width: 152px; text-align: justify;"><div style="margin-left: 80px;">স্বাঃ অস্পষ্ট<br/>			০৫/১২/১২<br/>			(মোঃ মাহমুদুল করিম)<br/>			সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব<br/>			বিচার শাখা-৭<br/>			ফোন-৯৫৫৮২৮৭</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>A plain reading of the Memo suggest that the Ministry in exercise of power under Section 4 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974, straightaway divided the Union of the petitioner carving out therefrom five Wards. There is no indication whatsoever why such a division became necessary or what prompted the Ministry so to do especially when all the adjacent Unions are undeniably running with only one Nikah Registrar each.  Nor is there anything to suggest that local residents were in need of a division of the kind. In the Memo the local Sub-Registrar was directed to get a panel of Nikah Registrars made by the Advisory Committee having placed before it the application received from Abdul Alim (Res-7). The Memo, read between the lines, leaves us with no doubt that Respondent No 7, a person who unsuccessfully fought against this petitioner for the post up to the apex court of the country, did not leave the battleground merely changed course. This time he chose to open a front at the top of the administration ie, the Ministry and kept haunting until the Memo was issued creating a new jurisdiction within the Union understandably for his appointment. It goes without saying that the Ministry acted arbitrarily, of its own, with collateral purpose only to accommodate a particular person not for the interest of the people. It is difficult to say that the decision taken <em>suo motu</em> by the Ministry does fit in any accepted standard of a civilized legal system. Unfortunately for us, this is not an isolated instance of desperate abuse of statutory discretion. It is representative of many such abuses of public office.<br/><br/>In a country like ours arbitrary exercise of power by government departments and public authorities is usually frequent. Even in advanced countries of the West instances of acting beyond authority and abuse of power is scarcely any less which is best captured by the percipient remark made by Maitland long ago:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“If you take up a modern volume of the Queen’s Bench Division, you will find that about half of the cases reported have to do with rules of administrative law…”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>True it is that abuse of power is there everywhere around the world. But they in most cases markedly differ from our abuses in degree as well as in kind. There it is rarely tainted with bad faith or intentional dishonesty and bulk of the actions and decisions arise out of ignorance or misunderstanding. The fact is better reflected in the remarks of Wade &amp; Forsyth (<em>infra</em>-Page 352):  <em>“It is extremely rare for public authorities to be found guilty of intentional dishonesty; normally they are found to have erred, if at all, by ignorance or misunderstanding. Yet the courts constantly accuse them of bad faith merely because they have acted unreasonably or on improper grounds</em>.”  In our country the abuse sometimes turns so nakedly arbitrary and desperately defiant of settled norms of discharging public duties that they bring reflection to bear upon the whole administration. It often so happens that executive apparatus are set on motion on a DO letter of a dignitary having nothing to do with affairs of the concerned ministry which, we believe, is unknown in the advanced societies.  <br/><br/>It is no denying that modern governments demand power as wider as possible.  Ever expanding state functions seeking to address the multifarious problems and needs of citizens and their wellbeing from cradle to grave gave rise to huge administrative apparatus. ‘Intensive governments of the modern kind cannot be carried out without a great deal of discretionary power.   Parliamentary draftsmen strive to find new forms of words which make discretion even wider’ which on their face might seem absolute and arbitrary. <br/><br/>It is axiomatic that wider is the discretion greater is the scope for abuse. Public functionaries as human beings are not free from personal bias, beliefs and prejudices to influence their judgments which tend to drive them out of the limit of law.  Total eradication of abuse of power is in that sense is an unattainable goal. We, therefore, are not as much concerned about mere abuse as we are about ignorance and misunderstanding that leads to such off-beat and ominous exercise of power as is incapable of explanation upon any proposition of modern administrative law principles.  When we are desperately in need of a good and efficient administration for maintenance of law and order, ensuring administrative justice and pushing ahead with various development programs taken by the Governments we are experiencing gradual degeneration in every phase of our administration and falling standard of efficiency and professionalism  with resultant increase in  most unusual  and shocking  abuse of   administrative discretion   which not only contributing to slowing down progress but also destroying the key institutions of the State  at the same time sending abroad an embarrassing  message about us as a nation.   It is, therefore, imperative to equip our public functionaries with minimal Constitutional and legal perspective of their offices and duties so that they cannot take wild departure, as many of them often do, from the basic requirement of law while discharging their duties rather than waiting for judicial cure from case to case at the cost of poor litigants, time and public money<strong>.</strong> <br/><br/>Viewed in the light, we feel called to restate as far as possible in lay terms some elementary words providing insight into inner significance of statutory discretion and how the discretionary power   is meant to be exercised within the limit of law <em>vis-à-vis</em> significance of a public office and legal status and duties of public functionaries so that instances of shocking  abuse of the present kind can be held back at a minimal level.  The executives need not attain mastery over the vast constitutional and administrative literature nor is it expected of them. It would suffice if they remember two things: first, Bangladesh is a Republic and a representative democracy where rule of law forms the bedrock of the Constitution. All power of the Republic here, as the Article 7 of the Constitution goes, belongs to the people and their exercise is made on their behalf only under and by the authority of the Constitution which is nothing but the solemn expression of the will of the people and the supreme law of the land. It must never be forgotten that they are paid by the people to exercise their power on their behalf only to serve their interest. They are public servants, pure and simple, nothing more nothing less. In that sense, they stand to the people in a fiduciary relationship entrusted to do administrative justice analogous to that of a trustee strictly in accordance with the scheme and policy of law made by the people’s representatives sitting in the Parliament.  Every power conferred upon the government, its department and other public authorities have, therefore, a public purpose implied in it for the precise reason that the Parliament while conferring power does it on behalf of the people for the benefit of the people and Parliament cannot be presumed to have intended it to be used arbitrarily or on considerations extraneous to the scheme and purpose of law.<br/><br/>Put differently, exercising of public power for any purpose other than what is contemplated in law is tantamount to acting beyond the limit of law  ie, <em>ultra vires</em>  as it is technically called.  If we not so far wrong,  exercise of public power for private purpose for that matter on a DO letter, so to speak, is not only illegal but also defiant of constitutional or legal mandates which is the <em>raison d’être</em> of  administrative justice.<br/><br/>In the second place, the question of language by which the power is conferred.  Discretionary power would usually be wider. There is no way back.  Because, modern governments demand power as wider as possible.  There are valid reasons behind it as well. Ever expanding state functions seeking to address the multifarious problems and needs of citizens and their wellbeing from cradle to grave gave rise to huge administrative apparatus. ‘Intensive governments of the modern kind cannot be carried out without a great deal of discretionary power.   More often than not the empowering phraseologies might seem absolute and arbitrary which may be illustrated by few examples, such as:  “if the authority deems fit”; “if in the opinion of the Commission it is expedient so to do”; if the Government is satisfied that it is expedient for public interest to send him to compulsory retirement”; “if the police officer has reason to believe” or as in the present case ‘whenever the Government deems fit so to do’.   The phraseologies are undoubtedly worded in wide, subjective and permissive languages.  The public functionaries have to work amid the juggleries of expressions and phrases conferring upon them wide and subjective power to take their actions and decisions.   The wordings need not confuse them. One guiding principle must be embedded in their thoughts and minds that there is no such thing as absolute or arbitrary administrative power.   They must act within the limit of law.  None of their actions or decision can be as unreasonable as no reasonable man applying his mind to the attendant facts, would have taken it. This is a basic standard to be kept in view while discharging public duties. The standard  has found  eloquent expression in the words of Lord Green in <em>Associated Provincial Picture House v Wednesbury Corp</em> reported in (1948) 1 KB 223. In the said case Lord Green observed that a decision is unreasonable ‘if it is so outrageous in defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it’.  This aphorism is known as ‘Wednesbury unreason-ableness’ which is followed by the courts, at least in the common law world, as an standard to test reasonableness of an administrative action or decision.<br/><br/>Save in case of  purely administrative orders  or notes, any order affecting right or interest of a person is <em>quasi</em> judicial in nature and must of necessity be issued or passed in accordance with  the  procedure provided by law. Even if the law is silent about procedure and the power is vested in subjective and permissive language certain procedural safeguard against abuse must be implied in the Act so that the person adversely affected is not taken by surprise and get a reasonable opportunity to be heard before he is condemned or his rights or interests are taken away as well as ‘the public may be able to rely on the law to ensure that all this power may be used in a way conformable to its ideas of fair dealing and good administration.’  That means power must be exercised justly, fairly and reasonably on considerations of relevant materials <em>vis-a-vis</em> the right and interest of the person affected.  In the words of Wade and Forsyth:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“Parliament when conferring power intends that power to be used fairly and with due consideration of rights and interests adversely affected… If an Act empowers a minister to act as he thinks fit in some matters, the court will read into the Act conditions requiring him to act within the bounds of reasonableness, to take account of relevant but not of irrelevant considerations, to conform to implicit policy of the Act, and to give a fair hearing to anyone prejudicially affected.”</em> (HWR Wade &amp; CF Forsyth: <em>Administrative Law</em>, 10<sup>th</sup> Ed, Pages 30-31).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In our constitutional dispensation safeguard against abuse of power is more comprehensive  and even wider than the due process clause of American constitution inasmuch it is not confined to life, liberty and property only and encompasses the  ‘whole range of human activity and attracted when a person is adversely affected by any state action’.  Article 31 of the Constitution by necessary implication contemplates ‘law’ as reasonable and non-arbitrary that is commensurate with rule of law. And rule of law is opposed to arbitrariness. Under our constitution even Parliament is barred from making any law no matter substantive or procedural which is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.  Because,  the fairest of procedure may often prove derogatory to enjoyment of life, liberty, property or any other right or privileges if the substantive law is unreasonable, unjust, overbroad and arbitrary.<br/><br/>Reverting back to the case, the impugned Memo was issued creating a new jurisdiction for a Nikah Registrar to be appointed carving out five Wards of the Union for which the petitioner was licensed for working as Nikah Registrar. The discretion is exercised under Section 4 of the Muslim Marriages &amp; Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974. We have already observed that the decision taken by the Ministry is grossly arbitrary, manifestly unreasonable and tainted with bad faith.  Let us now have a glance through Section 4 to see how the language conferring power is worded and how that leaves scope for the Ministry to act in the manner it did.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong><em>Section 4</em></strong><em>. For the purpose of registration of marriages under this Act, the Government shall grant licenses to such number of persons, to be called Nikah Registrars, as it may deem necessary for such areas as it may specify:</em><br/><em>Provided that not more than one Nikah Registrar shall be licensed for any one area:</em><br/><em>Provided further that the Government may, <u>whenever it deems fit so to do,</u> extend, curtail or otherwise alter the limits of any area for which a Niklah Registrar has been licensed.  (Emphasis added)</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>From a bare reading of the section it appears that second proviso of the section contains the empowering phrase which confers power upon the Government to bring about changes in a Nikah Register’s jurisdiction “whenever it deems fit so to do.” This is a phrase which is obviously worded in wide, subjective and permissive language and seemingly looks absolute. Misunderstanding the phrase or in other words failure to take the power in its constitutional and legal perspective may naturally follow if the authority is ignorant of  their position as public servants (not masters) and totally unaware of the meaning of  Parliament and the necessary  intendment of law made by it. It is often difficult to believe that they suffer from as much ignorance and misunderstanding as is incapable of understa-nding the concept of republic; their duty as public servants and by the same token incapable of taking the empowering phrase, irrespective of its wordings, in their true perspective. But many of their actions and decisions are indicative of misunderstanding on its face, which is possibly is of  a different kind clearly distinguishable from the ‘misunder-standing’ meant in the passage of Professor Wade (<em>supra</em>).  This, as we feel, is a egocentric  and blissful misunderstanding emanating from colonial mindset of the members of our bureaucracy many of whom want to keep the same alive so that absolute power may be enjoyed where possible which is otherwise  impossible once they are relegated to the status of true public servant, a concept, they are attitudinally opposed.<br/><br/>In dividing the jurisdiction of a Union directly from the centre the persons running the affairs of the Ministry remained totally unconcerned about the local people, their representative local bodies and the local administration. Furthermore, bad faith and irrelevant consideration in discharging public duty is manifest in their Memo.  They did not bother about the fact that the person named in their Memo lost up to the Apex Court in his fight against this petitioner for the post of Nikah Registrar of the Union. They did not bother as to the necessity of such division while other adjacent Unions are running with one Nikah Registrar each in similar circum-stances. In dividing the Union they presented a desperate demonstration of grotesque feat of arbitrariness far removed from the established principles and guidelines of exercising statutory discretion.<br/><br/>The instance created is best reflected in <em>Roncarelli v Duplessis</em> reported in 16 DLR (2d) 689, a Canadian case, where a restaurant proprietor’s liquor license had been cancelled by a Quebec Liquor Commission at the instigation of the Prime Minister of Quebec, for the reason that the proprietor habitually stood bail for members of the sect of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who were a nuisance to the police. The Supreme Court awarded damages against the Prime Minister and stigmatized the cancellation holding:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>In public regulation of this sort there is no such thing as absolute and untrammeled discretion…Discretion necessarily implies good faith in discharging public duty; there is always a perspective within which a statute is intended to operate; and any clear departure from its lines or objects is just as objectionable as fraud or corruption…[It] is a gross abuse of legal power expressly intended to punish him for an act wholly irreverent to the statute, a punishment which inflicted on him, , as it was intended to do, the destruction of his economic life as a restaurant keeper within the province. </em><br/><em>The Court went further to say:</em><br/><em>[This] is an outstandingly clear example of the abuse of executive power; this case illustrates the personal liability of ministers and possibility of a remedy in damage for maladministration.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Reasonableness, in the Wednesbury sense, requires that (continuous pressure or insistence, as often is the case here, from different corners notwithstanding) the Ministry’s bounden duty was to look back to the local people, their representative bodies as well as the local administration before taking the decision. Procedural fairness demands that the affected Nikah Registrar needs be made a party to the process and ascertain how hard he is going to be hit in terms of his earning and livelihood. And after completing the process if the curtailment   appears imperative for the benefit of the local residents Government, as of duty, would take recourse to the power conferred by Section 4 of the Act and create a new jurisdiction within a Union or other territorial jurisdictions, where it is so needed, on consideration of all the relevant materials on records.  Or conversely, the division might be effected on the requisition made by the local Union Parishad on the basis of a resolution with invitation to the incumbent Nikah Registrar to be present in the meeting and allowing him to speak out his opinion, if any,  to be recorded and sent with the requisition, may be through the local administration. The decision being <em>qusai</em> judicial, the process, in all fairness, should start from the local government level, as bodies directly in touch of the people acquainted with their peculiar problems not from the centre. The later course, in our opinion, is sounder simply because of the fact that the local bodies are best judge of the local problems and it is our constitutional obligation to promote local governments.<br/><br/>Power under Section 4 of the Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974, or for that matter any statutory power conferred upon the Government, its departments and other public authorities can never be unfettered far less absolute to be used at will.  The authority vested with power must, of duty, exercise them in the light of the scheme and object of the law vesting such power strictly keeping in view the ultimate benefit of the people. <br/>It is argued at the Bar that here license of the petitioner is not cancelled, therefore, the Ministry or the Union Parishad is not required to ask the affected Nikah Registrar to say anything.  We have no hesitation to reject the argument precisely for the reason that he is the man who bears the highest stake as one suffering loss of income, if any, by the action. If for the division his income significantly reduced affecting his livelihood meaning thereby that the number and volume of marriages and divorces is not as high as to justify creation of a new jurisdiction. In that case Government may not find it feasible to take the decision for curtailment. Secondly, proposal for division may not always be <em>bona fide</em> and sent for collateral purposes. He, therefore, must have scope to set his face and get his voice heard in any form so that Government may get a complete picture of the necessity canvassed and take appropriate decision.<br/><br/>In case of division of territorial limit Ruhul Quddus, J, went a bit further to say that, if in the public interest division becomes imperative,   an option should be given to the incumbent Registrar to choose any of the two  jurisdictions he likes to work for. We are in respectful agreement with the view taken by his Lordship, if he is not otherwise disqualified.<br/><br/>For what we have stated above we find substance in the submission of  Mr. Khan that the impugned order is tainted with bad faith issued at the behest of the interested quarters and not in the interest of the local people. The Rule, therefore, bears merit.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The impugned Memo carving out a new jurisdiction from No. 7, Bhadra Union in the District of Tangail is declared to have been issued without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>The order of stay granted earlier is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>There would, however, be no order as to cost.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

This consignment is the subject matter of Writ Petition No.2412 of 1990. At that time, the rate of tariff value was at Tk. 200.00 per ream of 500 sheets as per S.R.O. dated 15<sup>th</sup> June, 1989. The shipment of the consignment was made on 10.08.1989 and the import manifest was duly submitted on 27.09.1989 and the bill of entry was submitted on 15.05.1990 for noting. At that time S.R.O. No.47/AIN/90/1267/Sulka dated 28.01.1990 was in force. The tariff value in respect of the said goods was raised from Tk. 200.00 to Tk. 300.00 per ream. Again the tariff value was increased from Tk. 300.00 to Tk. 515.00 by S.R.O. No.105/AIN/90/1279/Shulka dated 10.03.1990. The petitioner imported another consignment of cigarette paper under L.C. dated 9<sup>th</sup> July, 1989 from the People’s Republic of China. The second consignment comprising 2000 reams (50 bales) of sheet at a cost of U.S.$ 8,730.00. This consignment is the subject matter of Writ Petition No. 2411 of 1990. Both the consignments arrived at Chittagong on the same date.  <br/><br/>The main contention of the writ-petitioner is that the writ-respondents should make assessment for the duty and tax on the basis of tariff value applicable on the date of import namely 09.07.1989 or on the date on which the import manifest was submitted i.e. 27.09.1989 when the tariff value was at Tk. 200.00 per ream under the S.R.O. dated 15.06.1989. It is contended that with the increase of the tariff value, the corresponding custom duty and other charges also increased and as such the writ-petitioner has been seriously prejudiced. The petitioner has acquired a vested right by virtue of operation of rate at that time when the L.C. was opened and the goods were shipped and as such the impugned demand by way of such notification is ex-facie bad, malafide and colourable exercise of the power of the customs authority and the same should be declared to have been made without any lawful authority and to be of no legal effect. <br/><br/>Against imposition of increased tariff value, the writ-petitioner moved the High Court Division and obtained both the Rules in both the writ-petitions. <br/><br/>The writ-respondents filed an affidavit-in-opposition controverting the material statements made in the writ-petition. Their case, in short, is that the impugned notification was issued or made in exercise of power vested in the Government and as such no illegality has been committed. It was stated that the tariff value of cigarette paper increased from Tk. 300.00 to Tk. 315.00 by issuance of notification under the authority conferred by the legislature under sub-section(7) of section 25 of the Customs Act, 1969. It is further stated that customs duties shall have to be paid on the tariff value prevailing on the date of delivery of bill of entry to the appropriate officer of Customs Authority as provided under section 30 of the Act. The provisional noting by submission of import manifest on 15.09.1990 has nothing to do with the assessment of duty. Therefore, the tariff value will be fixed as per provision of section 25 of the Customs Act, 1969.<br/><br/>The High Court Division heard both the writ-petitions simultaneously and discharged both the Rules by a common judgment and order dated 23.06.1994.<br/><br/>Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with judgment and order passed by the High Court Division, the writ-petitioner filed both the civil petitions for leave to appeal before this Division.<br/><br/>Hearing the parties, this Division by its order dated 18<sup>th</sup> August, 1999, granted leave in both the petitions resulting in the initiation of Civil Appeal Nos. 106 and 107 of 1999. <br/><br/>Mr. Monir Sharif, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, in both the appeals, submits that the appellant acquired a vested right not to pay any duty which was not in force on the date of opening of the letter of credit as he intended to import the goods seeing the rates in the notification prevalent on the date of opening of the letter of credit and that this  right could not be taken away by a subsequent SRO and that the High Court Division without considering this aspect discharged both the Rules.<br/><br/>In support of his contention, the learned Advocate for the appellant relies upon the cases of Collector of Customs Vs. A. Hannan, 42 DLR (AD)167; Collector of Customs V. Ahmed Hossain (1996) 48 DLR (AD) 199; and Mustafizur Rahman V. Government of Bangladesh and others, (1998) 18 BLD (AD) 219.<br/><br/>Mr. Ekramul Haque, learned Assistant Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the respondents, in both appeals, submits that the question raised by the appellant has already been settled by this Division in the case of Bangladesh and others V. Mizanur Rahman, (2000) 52 DLR (AD)149.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates of both the sides, the impugned judgment and the papers incorporated in the paper-books. The writ-petitioner imported two consignments of cigarette papers from the People’s Republic of China on the basis of letter of credit dated 9<sup>th</sup> July, 1989. At that time, the rate of tariff value was Tk. 200/- per ream of 500 sheets as per S.R.O. dated 15.06.1989. The tariff value in respect of the said goods increased from Tk. 200/- to Tk. 300/- per ream. Again the tariff value increased from Tk. 300/- to Tk. 515/- by S.R.O. dated 10.03.1990. Admittedly, the tariff value of the goods increased before submission of the bill of entry in exercise of power under section 25(7) of the Customs Act. Section 30 of the Act provides that the duty has to be assessed on the value of goods as on the date of submission of the bill of entry. The appellant contends that duty and tax have to be assessed on the basis of tariff value prevailing on the date of opening the L.C., that is, 09.07.1989.<br/> <br/>Let us consider the grounds on which leave was granted as under :<br/> <br/>Whether the respondents ought to have assessed the duties and sales tax at the rate of Tk. 200/- per ream, which was the tariff value applicable on the date of opening of letter of credit on 09.07.1989 and also on the date the import manifest when it was submitted on 27.09.1989 as per notification dated 15.06.1989 and the petitioner having imported both the consignments relying upon the tariff value rates as applicable then, and the petitioner is entitled in law to pay necessary duties etc. on such value and such lawful entitlement of the petitioner cannot be taken by giving retrospective effect to a subsequent notification.<br/> <br/>Whether bill of entry having been submitted on 15.05.1990, the tariff value @ Tk. 315.00 as in force on 10.03.1990 will be applicable in view of section 30(1) of the Customs Act, which provides for rate of duty as applicable on the date of submission of bill of entry and not rate of tariff value as applicable on the date of submission of bill of entry and the High Court Division was wrong to hold by reference to section 30 that the tariff values on the date of submission of the bill of entry would be applicable inasmuch as there is no provision in the  Customs Act providing for application of tariff value as on the date of submission of the bill of entry.<br/> <br/>Whether tariff value as fixed in exercise of power under section 25(7) has prospective application and the petitioner having already opened letter of credit as per notification dated 15.06.1989, and there is a vested right created in favour of the petitioner, who has fulfilled the conditions of importing the goods under the said notification and the right created by the notification dated 15.06.1989 cannot be taken away by the subsequent notification as the same can not be given  retrospective effect.<br/> <br/>Whether three decisions of this Court reported in 42, DLR (AD)167, 48 DLR (AD)199 and 18 BLD (AD)219 are applicable on the facts of the case.<br/><br/>For proper appreciation of the issues, it is necessary to have a glance over section 25(7) of the Customs Act as quoted below :</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“(7) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the Government may by notification in the official Gazette, fix for the purpose of levying customs duties, tariff values for any goods imported or exported as chargeable with customs duty advalorem;<br/>Provided that any imported or exported goods the declared value of which is higher than its tariff value fixed under this sub-section shall be chargeable with customs duties on the basis of its declared value.” <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having considered sub-section (7) of section 25 of the Act, it appears that Government may by notification in the official gazette fix the tariff value of any goods imported or exported as chargeable with customs duty ad valorem. The duty shall be chargeable on the tariff value which was in existence on the date of submission of the bill of entry.<br/><br/>In both cases, the bill of entry was submitted on 15.05.1990 for noting. At that time S.R.O. No.47/AIN/90/1267/Sulka dated 28.01.1990 was in force. The letter of credit for both the consignments was opened on 09.07.1989 when the tariff value was at Tk. 200/- per ream of 500 sheets as per the S.R.O. dated 15.06.1989. The tariff value in respect of the goods was raised from Tk. 200/- to Tk. 300/- per ream. Again the tariff value was raised from Tk. 300/- to Tk. 515/- by SRO dated 10.03.1990. Therefore, the appellant was under the legal obligation to pay tax and duty on the imported goods on the basis of tariff value as per the S.R.O. dated 10.03.1990 and at the relevant time, the tariff value was Tk. 515/- per ream of 100 sheets.<br/><br/>The case of Collector of Customs Vs. A. Hannan, (1990) 42 DLR (AD)167 dealt with the impact of issuance of notification under section 19 of the Customs Act exempting customs duty. The High Court Division held that such a notification created a vested right in favour of the importer and this Division held that such a notification gave rise to a promissory estoppel from claiming enhanced customs duty.<br/><br/>In the case of Bangladesh Vs. Mizanur Rahman (2000) 52 DLR (AD) 149, this Division reviewed the decision made in the case of Mustafizur Rahman V. Government of Bangladesh and others, (1998) 18 BLD (AD) 219 (51 DLR (AD)40) holding that the then Attorney General could not bring to its notice the distinguishing feature between Hannan’s case and the case of Mustafizur Rahman which was a case under section 25(7) of Customs Act. This Division further held that no vested right was acquired to pay sale taxes and customs duty on the basis of tariff value declared by the notification in force on the date of opening the letter of credit. The importer has to pay tax and duty on the basis of tariff value in force on the date of presentation of the bill of entry.<br/><br/>The case of Collector of Customs Vs. Ahmed Hossain, (1996) 48 DLR (AD) 199 was a case under section 19 of the Customs Act. This Division primarily decided the question of acquiring vested right in the matter of getting exemption from customs duties on the basis of earlier notification and the same could not adversely affect the subsequent notification made by the Government in exercise of the power of delegated legislature.<br/><br/>Notification issued under section 19 is independent of the rate of duty mentioned in section 30 and there is no connection between sections 19 and 30 of the Act.<br/><br/>The exemption under section 19 of the Act and the declaration of tariff value under section 25(7) of the Act are quite distinguishable. The cases reported in 42 DLR (AD) 167 and 48 DLR (AD)199 did not held that the importer acquired vested right to pay tax and duty on the basis of invoice value and tariff value existing at the time of opening of the letter of credit. Therefore, the Appellant has to pay tax and duty on the basis of tariff value on the date of presentation of the bill of entry.<br/><br/>In the light of the findings made before, we do not find any ground to interfere with the judgment and order of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>Accordingly, both the appeals are dismissed without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

These petitions are heard together and they are dealt with by this single judgement.<br/><br/>The facts relevant for disposal of the petitions are that the writ respondent No. 2 (petitioner herein) in his official capacity published a circular in “the Daily Samakal” on 16.02.2010 and “the Daily Jugantor” on 20.02.2010 to appoint persons in some posts in the office of the Non-Government Teachers Registration and Certification Authority (NTRCA). The respondents had applied for the post of Assistant Director in the NTRCA complying all the formalities and, accordingly, admit cards were issued inviting the respondents to sit in the examination for selection. Ultimately, the 5 (five) respondents were selected through written examination followed by viva-voce for the post of Assistant Director in the NTRCA, and upon their selection the Chairman of NTRCA issued appointment letters to respondent Lutfor Rahman vide Memo No. বেশিনিক/১ম শ্রেণীর কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ/ ২৫৫/২০১০/৩৭৬ dated 13.06.2010, to respondent Pulack Chakma vide Memo No. বেশিনিক/১ম শ্রেণীর কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ/ ২৫৫/২০১০/৩৭৯ dated 13.06.2010, to respondent Faizar Ahmed vide Memo No. বেশিনিক/১ম শ্রেণীর কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ/ ২৫৫/২০১০/৩৭৭ dated 13.06.2010, to respondent Md. Mustaque Ahmed vide Memo No. বেশিনিক/১ম শ্রেণীর কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ/ ২৫৫/২০১০/৩৭৫ dated 13.06.2010, and to respondent Saiful Islam vide Memo No. বেশিনিক/১ম শ্রেণীর কর্মকর্তা নিয়োগ/ ২৫৫/২০১০/৩৭৪ dated 13.06.2010.<br/><br/>Pursuant to the said appointment letters, respondent Lutfor Rahman submitted his joining letter on 16.06.2010 which was duly accepted by the Chairman, NTRCA(petitioner No. 1) and he was appointed on the same day in the post of Assistant Director (Service and Co-ordination) at Administration and Finance Wing of NTRCA. Respondent Pulock Chakma submitted his joining letter to the Chairman, NTRCA on 21.06.2010 and after acceptance of the same he was appointed in the post of Assistant Director (Certificate) at Evaluation and Certificate Wing of the NTRCA on the same date. Respondent Faizar Ahmed, Md. Mustaque Ahmed and Md. Shaiful Islam submitted their joining letters to the Chairman, NTRCA on 15.06.2010 and after acceptance of the same, respondent Faizar Ahmed and Mustaque Ahmed were posted as Assistant Director at Evaluation of Examination and Certificate Wing and respondent Shaiful Islam in the post of Assistant Director at Administration and Finance Wing of NTRCA on 16.06.2010.<br/><br/>The respondents had been performing their respective duties to the satisfaction of the authority and all others concerned from the date of their joining. The Secretary of NTRCA wanted police verification reports of the respondents from the Superintendent of Police of their respective district. The office of the Superintendent of Police in compliance of the said letter verified the character of the respondents and submitted report accordingly. All of a sudden, on 14.03.2011 the petitioner No. 2 by his order (Annexure-E to the writ petition) cancelled the appointment of the respondents. The respondents moved the Ministry of Education to redress their grievances but in vain. The respondents, before joining in the NTRCA, had been working in different posts, and they duly applied for the post of Assistant Director in the NTRCA after leaving their jobs and they were duly appointment in accordance with law. Hence, the impugned order cancelling the appointments of the respondents is illegal. No show cause notices were served upon the writ petitioners-respondents before issuing the impugned order. Thus the arbitrary action of the petitioner No. 2 is nothing but malice in law which was passed with an ulterior motive to cause harm to the respondents. The respondents filed five separate writ petitions and obtained Rule.<br/><br/>The Rules were opposed by the petitioner Nos. 2 and 3 by filing affidavit-in-opposition contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the former Chairman of NTRCA violating the rule Nos. 4, 5 (2) (Ka) and (Kha) of the Service Rules (Officers and Employees) of NTRCA, 2009 (in short, the Service Rules) had appointed the respondents. There is provisions in rule 4 of the Service Rules that the authority in order to appoint an employee in the NTRCA will constitute a Selection Committee (বাছাই কমিটি) and without the approval of such ""বাছাই কমিটি'' there would be no appointment in the NTRCA. Rule 5(2) (Ka) and (Kha) of the Service Rules also provides that no person will be appointed in any post of NTRCA until and unless he is found physically fit by a medical officer or medical board appointed by the authority for the said purpose, and also, there would be no appointment without verification of his character by the agency having competent jurisdiction to do the same. In this particular case there was no such ""বাছাই কমিটি'' and there was no recommendation from the ""বাছাই কমিটি'' for the appointment of the respondents. As such, the appointment of the respondents was illegal and the former Chairman, who appointed the respondents, had no jurisdiction to appoint them. As soon as the said violation of the provisions of the Service Rules was detected their appointments were cancelled duly by the Executive Board of NTRCA in its 32<sup>nd</sup> meeting, which was duly approved by the 35<sup>th</sup> meeting of the said Board of NTRCA. Pursuant to the said decision the impugned order was issued canceling the appointments of the respondents. So the Rules should be discharged.<br/><br/>After hearing the parties, by the impugned judgement and order dated 25.08.2011, the Rules were made absolute. Hence, the writ respondents as petitioners filed the instant civil petitions for leave to appeal.<br/><br/>Mrs. Sufia Khatun, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the Service Rules require that appointment of staff or officer in the NTRCA must be made by a selection committee (বাছাই কমিটি), but in this case there was no recommendation of the বাছাই কমিটি in respect of the respondents. She submits that the appointment of the respondents by the former Chairman, without the recommendation of the selection committee, was illegal and, therefore, their appointments were rightly cancelled. She submits that the cancellation of the appointment of the respondents was agreed in a resolution of the Executive Board of NTRCA in its 32<sup>nd</sup> meeting which was approved in the 35<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Board. She submits that the High Court Division erred in law in not considering the fact that the respondents were appointed illegally.<br/><br/>Mrs. Madhu Malati Chowdhury Barua learned Advocate-on-Record appears for respondent No. 1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 251,253 and 255 of 2012 and Mr. Syed Mahbubar  Rahman, learned Advocate-on-Record appears for respondent No. 1 in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal Nos. 252 and 254 of 2012. Both submit in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. <br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates for the parties concerned, perused the impugned judgement and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>It appears from the materials on record that the respondents applied for their respective post in response to the advertisement for the vacancies mentioned, and after fulfilling all the requirements of the selection procedure, including appearing in the competitive written and viva voce examinations. They were duly issued their appointment letters after medical examination and police verification. It transpires that the appointment of the respondents was subsequently cancelled without issuing any show cause notice.<br/><br/>The High Court Division observed that before issuing the impugned order cancelling the appointment of the writ petitioners no show cause notice was served upon them and that the principles of natural justice has been seriously violated and ignored.<br/><br/>It is patent from the records that all the respondents went through the rigorous process of selection and were appointed in their respective post. They were served with notices cancelling their appointment without issuing any show cause notice. The respondents joined their posts and served accordingly for more than nine months at the time of filing their writ petition.<br/><br/>We are of the view that without issuing any show cause notice the petitioners could not lawfully cancel the letter of appointment of the respondents.<br/><br/>We find that the impugned judgement does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity and does not call for any interference. Accordingly, the civil petitions for leave to appeal are dismissed.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
