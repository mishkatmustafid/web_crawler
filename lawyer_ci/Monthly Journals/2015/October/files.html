B. M. Hassan, J.</strong></u><br/> <br/>This Rule was issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the order dated 16.03.2006 (Annexure-A/1 to the writ petition) passed by the learned Judge, Artha Rin Adalat, Narayangonj in Miscellaneous Case No. 26 of 2005 (arising out of Mortgage Execution Case No. 123 of 2003) and order dated 27.10.2005 (Annexure-C/1 to the supplementary affidavit of the writ petition) passed by the learned Judge, Artha Rin Adalat, Narayangonj in Mortgage Execution Case No. 123 of 2003 should not be declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>Pertinent facts necessary for disposal of the Rule are as follows:<br/>         The petitioner as plaintiff instituted Mortgage Suit No. 48 of 2002 before the Artha Rin Adalat, Narayangonj (shortly, the Adalat) for realization of loan money amounting to Tk. 8,61,120/- against the respondent Nos. 4-7. Ultimately, the suit was decreed by judgment and decree dated 03.10.2002 (decree signed on 10.10.2002) for Tk. 8,61,120/-. Pursuant to the said judgment and decree, the petitioner filed Mortgage Execution Case No. 123 of 2003 before the Adalat. In the execution proceeding, the Adalat fixed the date for auction sale of the mortgaged property and accordingly, at the instance of the petitioner (decree holder), the auction notice was published in “The Daily Jugantar” for selling the mortgaged property mentioning estimated value of the property at Tk. 11,00,000/-. On 27.10.2005, the date of auction sale of the property, the highest offer was made at Tk. 3,00,000/- out of three bidders. The highest offer having been found with abnormally low price, the petitioner (decree holder Bank) instantly filed an application raising objection to the said offered price and prayed for cancellation of the auction sale. The Adalat by order dated 27.10.2005 rejected the said application accepting the highest price of Tk. 3,00,000/- of the respondent No.3 and directed him to pay the balance amount of the bid by 06.11.2005.<br/> <br/>Thereafter, the petitioner filed an application under Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) on 30.11.2005 for setting aside the auction sale. The application was registered as Miscellaneous Case No. 26 of 2005 and ultimately, the Miscellaneous Case was rejected by order dated 16.03.2006. Against the aforesaid order, the petitioner preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 55 of 2006 before the learned District Judge, Narayangonj and it was transmitted to the Court of the learned Additional District Judge, Narayangonj for disposal. After hearing, the learned Additional District Judge, Narayangonj by judgment and order dated 15.04.2008 dismissed the said miscellaneous appeal.<br/><br/>In this back drop, the petitioner filed this writ petition challenging the order dated 16.03.2006 rejecting the miscellaneous case filed under Order XX1 Rule 90 of the Code and also the order dated 27.10.2005 passed by the Adalat in Mortgage Execution Case No.123 of 2003 rejecting the application of the petitioner praying for cancelling the auction sale and obtained the present Rule.<br/><br/>The judgment debtor as respondent No. 5 entered appearance in the Rule by filing affidavit-in-opposition. It is stated in the affidavit-in-opposition that in the auction notice the estimated value of the mortgaged property was shown at Tk. 11,00,000/-. Despite the Adalat accepted the highest offer at Tk. 3,00,000/- which was shockingly low. In view of the facts, the respondent No. 5 supports the Rule.<br/><br/>Mr. A.K.M. Badrudduza, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner has taken us through the writ petition, the impugned order, supplementary affidavit and other materials available on record. The learned Advocate submits that in the auction notice the estimated value of the property has been shown at Tk. 11,00,000/- and that finding the exorbitantly low price of Tk. 3,00,000/- as highest offer, the petitioner immediately raised objection to the price and prayed for canceling the auction sale as per proviso to section 33(2) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (shortly, the Ain, 2003) and the Adalat rejected the said application by the impugned order dated 27.10.2005 (Annexure-C1 to the supplementary affidavit of the writ petition). He frankly concedes that wrongly the petitioner filed the miscellaneous case under Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code for setting aside the auction sale and that in the application of the miscellaneous case, the assertion of the petitioner was against the order of the Adalat accepting the highest offer being shockingly low and that on wrong advice the petitioner also challenged the order of the miscellaneous case in the miscellaneous appeal preferred before the learned District Judge, Narayangonj. In the light of the aforesaid submission, the learned Advocate does not like to press the order dated 16.03.2006 passed in miscellaneous case No. 26 of 2005.<br/><br/>However, the learned Advocate has drawn our attention to the application dated 27.10.2005 and the order of the Adalat dated 27.10.2005 passed on the said application (Annexure-C and C/1 respectively to the supplementary affidavit of the writ petition). Challenging the propriety of the order dated 27.10.2005 in this Rule, the learned Advocate submits that proviso to section 33(2) of the Ain, 2003 empowers the Adalat to reject the offer (auction proposal) if it is found abnormally low and that in the auction notice the estimated price of the property having been shown at Tk. 11,00,000/-, the highest offer at Tk. 3,00,000/-, on the face of it, abnormally  low. He further submits that immediately, after finding the highest offer at Tk. 3,00,000/- the petitioner raised objection against the said price and prayed before the Adalat, not to accept the said offer, being shockingly low. But the Adalat on misconception of the legal proposition of section 37 of the Ain, 2003, rejected the said application accepting the offer at Tk. 3,00,000/. He also submits that the borrower also raised objection against the highest offer at Tk. 3,00,000/- being shockingly low price. Lastly, the learned Advocate submits that the Adalat is not obliged to sell the property by any manner when the law has provided the alternative option to the decree holder towards satisfaction of the decree by taking control and possession of the property under section 33(5) of the Ain, 2003 and or the Adalat can issue certificate of title in respect of mortgaged property in favour of the decree holder under section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Abdus Sattar Khan, the learned Advocate for the respondent No.5 (the borrower-judgment-debtor) concedes the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner. He also submits that the offer at Tk. 3,00,000/- was shockingly low and the Adalat on misconception of law as well as on facts accepted the said price by the impugned order dated 27.10.2005.<br/><br/>Though notice was duly served upon the respondent No. 3, the auction purchaser, but he has not appeared in the Rule.<br/><br/>We have gone through the writ petition, supplementary affidavit thereto, affidavit-in-opposition, impugned order and other materials as available on record. <br/><br/>It appears that Rule was issued to examine the propriety of the order dated 16.03.2006 passed by the Adalat in Miscellaneous Case No. 26 of 2005 arose out of Mortgage Execution Case No. 123 of 2003 and also the order dated 27.10.2005 passed by the Adalat in Mortgage Execution Case No. 123 of 2003. The learned Advocate does not like to press the Rule so far as it relates to the order dated 16.03.2006 submitting that it was filed by the petitioner in a wrong forum on misconception of law.<br/><br/>In view of the facts, let us examine the propriety of the order dated 27.10.2005 passed by the Adalat rejecting the application filed by the petitioner raising objection to the highest offer at Tk. 300,000/- being abnormally low.<br/>Section 33 of the Ain, 2003 is the relevant law involved for auction sale of the mortgaged property for satisfaction of the artha rin decree. For better understanding, the provision of section 33 of the Ain, 2003 as was prevailing at the relevant time is quoted herein below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>“৩৩(১) অর্থ ঋন আদালত ডিত্র্রী বা আদেশ জারীর সময় কোন সম্পত্তি বিত্র্রয়ের ক্ষেত্রে বাদীর খরচে বিজ্ঞপ্তি প্রচারের তারিখ হইতে অন্যূন ১৫(পনের) দিবসের সময় দিয়া সীলমোহরকৃত টেন্ডার আহবান করিবে, উক্ত বিজ্ঞপ্তি কমপক্ষে ব<span dir="RTL">‎‎</span>হুল প্রচারিত একটি বাংলা জাতীয় ~~দনিক পত্রিকায়, তদুপরি ন্যায় বিচারের স্বার্থে প্রয়োজন মনে করিলে সয় একটি পত্রিকায়, যদি থাকে, প্রকাশ করিবে; এবং আদালতের নোটিশ বোর্ডে লটকাইয়া ও সÛানীয়ভাবে ঢোল সহরত যোগেও উক্ত বিজ্ঞপ্তি প্রচার করিবেz<br/>(২) প্রত্যেক দরদাতা উদ্ধৃত দরের ২৫% এর সমপরিমান টাকা জামাতনস্বরুপ ব্যাংক ড্রাফট বা পে-অর্ডারের আকারে আদালতের অনুকুলে  দরপত্রের সহিত দাখিল করিবেন, দরপত্র সরাসরি দরপত্র বাক্সে কিংবা রেজিষ্ট্রিকৃত ডাকযোগে নির্ধারিত সময়ের মধ্যে নির্ধারিত কর্তৃপক্ষের নিকট প্রেরনের মাধ্যমে দাখিল করিবেন; এবং দরদাতা, দর গৃহীত হইবার পরবর্তী ১০(দশ) দিবসের মধ্যে সমুদয় মূল্য পরিশোধ করিবেন এবং তাহা করিতে ব্যর্থ হইলে, আদালত তাঁহার উক্ত জামানতের টাকা বাজেয়াপ্ত করিবে;<br/>তবে শর্ত থাকে যে, এই উপ-ধারার অধীন দরপত্রে সম্পত্তির প্রস¹াবকৃত মূল্য অস্বাভাবিকভাবে অপর্যাপ্ত বা কম প্রতীয়মান হইলে, আদালত, দরপ্রস¹াব বাতিল করিতে পারিবেনz<br/>(৩) উপ-ধারা (২) এর অধীন জামানত বাজেয়াপ্ত হইলে উহার অর্থ ডিত্র্রীদারকে প্রদান করা হইবে, ডিত্র্রীকৃত দাবীর সহিত উক্ত অর্থ সমন্বয় করা হইবে, এবং অতঃপর আদালত, দ্বিতীয় সর্বোচ্চ দরদাতা কর্তৃক উদ্ধৃত দর এবং পূর্বে বাজেয়াপ্তকৃত জামানত একত্রে সর্বোচ্চ দরদাতা কর্তৃক উদ্ধৃত দর অপেক্ষা কম না হইলে, উক্ত দ্বিতীয় সর্বোচ্চ দরদাতাকে সম্পত্তি নিলাম খরিদ করিতে আহবান করিবে; এবং দ্বিতীয় সর্বোচ্চ দরদাতা অাহূত হইবার পরবর্তী ১০(দশ) দিবসের মধ্যে সম্পূর্ণ মুল্য পরিশোধ করিবেন এবং তাহা করিতে ব্যর্থ হহলে তাঁহার জামানত বাজেয়াপ্ত হইবে এবং জামানতের উক্ত অর্থ ডিত্র্রীদারকে ডিত্র্রীর দাবীর সহিত সমন্বয় করিবার জন্য প্রদান করা হইবেz<br/>(৪) কোন সম্পত্তি উপ-ধারা (১), (২) ও (৩) এর বিধান অনুসারে নীলামে বিত্র্রয় করা সম্ভব না হইলে, আদালত পুনরায় কমপক্ষে বহুল প্রচারিত ২(দুই) টি বাংলা জাতীয় ~~দনিক পত্রিকায়, তদুপরি ন্যায় বিচারের স্বার্থে প্রয়োজন মনে করিলে সÛানীয় একটি পত্রিকায়, যদি থাকে, উপ-ধারা (১) এর অনুরুপ পদ্ধতিতে বিজ্ঞপ্তি প্রকাশ করাইয়া এবং আদালতের নোটিশ বোর্ডে নোটিশ টাংগাইয়া ও সÛানীয়ভাবে ঢোল সহরতযোগে সীলমোহরকৃত টেন্ডার আহবান করিবে; এবং বিত্র্রয় ও বাজেয়াপ্ত বিষয়ে উপ-ধারা (২) ও (৩) এ উল্লিখিত বিধান অনুসরণ করিবে<br/>(৫) কোন সম্পত্তি উপ-ধারা (১), (২), (৩) ও (৪) এর বিধান অনুসারে বিত্র্রয় করা সম্ভব না হইলে, উক্ত সম্পত্তি, ডিত্র্রীকৃত দাবী পরিপূর্ণভাবে পরিশোধিত না হওয়া পর্য¿¹, দখল ও ভোগের অধিকারসহ ডিত্র্রীদারের অনুকুলে ন্যস¹ করা হইবে, এবং ডিত্র্রীদার উপ-ধারা (১), (২), (৩) ও (৪) এর বিধান অনুসারে উক্ত সম্পত্তি বিত্র্রয় করিয়া অপরিশোধিত ডিত্র্রীর দাবী অাদায় করিতে পারিবে, এবং আদালত ঐ মর্মে একটি সার্টিফিকেট ইস্যু করিবেz<br/>(৬) ডিত্র্রীকৃত অংকের অতিরিক্ত অর্থ বিত্র্রয় বাবদ অাদায় হইলে, উক্ত অতিরিক্ত অর্থ দায়িককে ফেরৎ প্রদান করিতে হইবে, এবং বিত্র্রীকৃত অর্থ ডিত্র্রীর দাবী অপক্ষো কম হইলে অবশিষ্ট অর্থ বাবদ,২৮ ধারার বিধান সাপেক্ষে, আরো জারীর মামলা গ্রহণযোগ্য হইবেz<br/>(৭) উপ-ধারা (৪) ও (৫) এর বিধান সত্তেÆও, ডিত্র্রীদার, উল্লিখিত সম্পত্তি মালিকানাসত্তেÆ পাইতে আগ্রহী মর্মে আদালতের নিকট লিখিতভাবে আবেদন করিলে, আদালত, উপ-ধারা (১), (২) ও (৩) এর বিধানাবলীর কোনরুপ হানি না ঘটাইয়া, উপ-ধারা (৪) ও (৫) এর কার্যত্র্রম অনুসরন করা হইতে বিরত থাকিবে; এবং ডিত্র্রীদারের প্রার্থিতমতে উল্লেখিত সম্পত্তির স্বত্তÆ ডিত্র্রীদারের অনুকুলে ন্যস¹ হইয়াছে মর্মে ঘোষনা প্রদানপূর্বক তৎমর্মে একটি সনদপত্র জারী করিবে এবং জারীকৃত এইরুপ সনদপত্র সত্তেÆর দলিল হিসাবে গণ্য হইবে; এবং আদালত উহার একটি অনুলিপি সংশ্লিষ্ট সÛানীয় সাব-রেজিষ্ট্ররের অফিসে নিবন্ধনের জন্য প্রেরণ করিবেz<br/>(৮) বর্তমানে প্রচলিত অন্য কোন আইনে যাহা কিছুহ~ থাকুক না কেন, উপ-ধারা (৭) এর অধীনে জারীকৃত সনদপত্র বাবদ কোন কর বা রেজিষ্ট্রেশন ফি আদায়যোগ্য হইবে না z<br/>(৯) উপ-ধারা (৫) এর অধীনে সম্পত্তির দখল ও ভোগের অধিকার অথবা উপ-ধারা (৭) এর অধীনে সম্পত্তির স্বত্তÅ ডিত্র্রীদারের অনুকুলে ন্যাস¹ হইলে, ধারা ২৮ এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, উক্ত ডিত্র্রী জারী মামলার চূড়া নিষ্পত্তি হইবে”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the present case before us the auction notice was published in “The Daily Jugantar” as per section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003 for selling the mortgaged property mentioning estimated value of the property at Tk. 11,00,000/-. On 27.10.2005, the date of auction sale, 3 (three) bidders participated in the bid with their respective price and the highest offer was made by the respondent No.3 at Tk. 3,00,000/-. On the very day, the petitioner filed an application raising objection to the offered price on the ground that the price was abnormally low and the petitioner prayed for canceling the auction sale. It further appears that the Adalat rejected the said prayer assigning the reason that he was required to dispose of the execution case by 150 days as per section 37 of the Ain, 2003. By filing affidavit-in-opposition the borrower (respondent No. 5) also submits that the offered price of the property is exorbitantly low.<br/> <br/>Proviso to section 33(2) of the Ain, 2003 empowers the Adalat to cancel the proposal of the bidder if the offered price of the property is found abnormally low. In this case, admittedly the estimated value has been shown in the auction notice at Tk. 11,00,000/-. Therefore, the highest offer at Tk. 3,00,000/-, on the face of it, appears to be abnormally low. Moreover, the borrower, as the land owner also admits that the price is shockingly low. In the circumstances, the Adalat ought to have rejected the bidders offer at Tk.3,00,000/- instead of accepting it by the impugned order dated 27.10.2005. It also appears that in passing the impugned order, the Adalat did not discuss about the value of the property, inspite of the fact that the petitioner raised objection specifically about the price. Further it has already been settled by a good number of cases that provision of section 37 of the Ain, 2003 regarding time limit for disposing of the execution case, is not mandatory rather it is directory.  The Adalat misconceived the legal position and thereby considering the time frame for disposing of the execution case rejected the application for canceling the auction sale accepting the objected low price. Thus, the impugned order suffers from gross illegality and as such, it is liable to be interfered by this Court.<br/> <br/>We also find that section 33 of the Ain, 2003 has provided the alternative provisions for disposing of the judgment-debtor’s property towards satisfaction of the decretal dues. In this process, if the Adalat fails to hold the auction in pursuance of the section 33(1)-33(4) of the Ain, 2003, the law empowers the Adalat to issue certificate of possession in respect of the property under section 33(5) of the Ain, 2003 and that the decree-holder taking possession and control over the property, can sell it following the provisions of section 33(1)-33(4) of the Ain, 2003. Besides, on the prayer of the decree-holder, the Adalat can issue certificate of title in favour of the decree holder in respect of the property as provided in section 33(7) of the Ain, 2003 following the conditions as laid down in the said sub-section.<br/><br/>Therefore, the Adalat is not obliged to sell the property in any manner or at any price for satisfaction of the decree, particularly when the decree holder specifically raises objection to the highest offer being abnormally low and that the amount is too inadequate to satisfy the decretal dues. <br/><br/>In view of the above discussions, we are led to hold that the Adalat committed error of law, apparent on the face of the record, in passing the impugned order dated 27.10.2005 and, as such, it warrants interference by this Court.<br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute in part. The order dated 27.10.2005 passed by the Adalat (respondent No.2) in Mortgage Execution Case No. 123 of 2003 (Annexure-C/1 to the supplementary affidavit of the writ petition) is hereby declared to have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>No costs.<br/><br/>The ad-interim order of stay stands vacated.<br/><br/>Communicate the judgment and order to the respondent No. 2 expeditiously.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

(38)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>The High Court Division should bear in mind</strong><strong> the social conditions and circumstances of </strong><strong>the country where sometimes wild allegations</strong><strong> are being made against the law enforcing agencies, for no fault of their own, alleging </strong><strong>gross violation of fundamental rights but at the</strong><strong> same time in certain cases excess committed </strong><strong>by the law enforcing agencies thereby causing</strong><strong> gross violation of fundamental rights cannot be ruled out. . . .

(38)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>There was no malice on the part of the appellants as alleged by the writ petitioners in the writ petitions and the violation of fundamental right was not being gross and patent and ex-facie glaring or the violation was not unjust and unduly harsh or oppressive the High Court Division erred in law in awarding monetary compensation and compensatory cost which cannot be passed unless it is specifically proved and claimed in an appropriate case as stated in the judgment. The writ petitioner failed to make out an appropriate case and as such the impugned decision of the High Court Division in awarding a lump sum monitory compensation in each of these cases must be held to have been made without lawful authority. </strong><strong>It is expected that a court should not make any sweeping remark or irrelevant observation in a case and identify itself to the cause of any of the parties to a case on which it is adjudicating.  . . .(40)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>In the instant cases, it appears that neither </strong><strong>in the writ petitions, nor in the Supplementary </strong><strong>Affidavits nor in the Affidavits-In- Reply the </strong><strong>writ petitioners made any statement regarding</strong><strong> the so-called inhuman mental and physical torture of the detinues in the jail custody as alleged by Mr. Moudud Ahmed the learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners, in his submissions.

Muzammel Hossain, CJ:</strong><br/><br/>Civil Appeal  Nos. 90 to 93 of  2000, by leave, are directed against the judgments and orders dated 07.04.1997 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition Nos.1662 of 1997, 1661 of 1997,1660 of 1997 and 1663 of 1997 respectively and Civil Appeal No. 89 of 2000,  by leave, is directed against the Judgment and Order dated 29-09-1999 passed by a Division Bench of  the High Court Division in Writ Petition 3489 of 1999 wherein all the  detunes were released after making the  Rules  absolute  with directions to pay monetary compensation of Tk. 1,00,000/-(Taka one lakh only) to each of the detenues  in the former 4 (four) Writ Petitions and Tk. 10,000/- to the detenue  in Writ Petition No. 3489 of 1999. All these Civil Appeals are being disposed of by this single judgment as common questions of law and facts are involved in all these appeals.<br/> <br/>Since common questions of law and facts are involved in all the Writ Petitions, for the sake of brevity, it would be convenient to state the facts of Writ Petition No. 1662 of 1997 instead of Writ Petition Nos. 1661 of 1997, 1660 of 1997 and 1663 of 1997 and separately to state the facts of Writ Petition No.3489 of 1999.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><u>Writ Petition No. 1662 of 1997</u></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The writ petitioner, Bilkis Akhter Hossain, is the wife of the detenue, Mr. Khandakar Mosharaf Hossain, who was arrested on 20-03-1997 under Section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. At the relevant time he was a Member of Parliament from the Constituency No. 249, Comilla-2.  Thrice he was elected a Member of Parliament from the said Constituency. He was a Member of the Standing Committee of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). He was the Minister in-charge of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Home Affairs. The detenue obtained his P<sup>h</sup>D degree from the Imperial College, the University of London. He was a teacher of the University of Dhaka. On 20-03-1997 in the morning he was picked up from his residence by the police without any order or warrant of arrest and then he was sent to Dhaka Central Jail. When he was arrested and sent to jail neither the order of detention nor the grounds of detention were served upon him. By a Supplementary-Affidavit the order of detention as well as the grounds of detention was submitted to the High Court Division by the respondent No. 1 wherein it has been revealed that the order of detention was served upon the detenue on 20.03.1997 and the grounds of detention were served upon the detenue on 28-03-1997. It is stated that the detenue was detained under the Special Powers Act, 1974  unlawfully and without jurisdiction. He was detained to suppress his political movement and also for political victimization. The detaining Authority has exercised its power with malafide intention and there is no nexus in between the order of detention and the grounds of detention. The order of detention was violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.<br/> <br/>The present appellant as respondent no. 1 filed an Affidavit-In-Opposition to the writ petition denying the allegations made therein stating, inter alia, that the detenue was arrested on 20-03-1997 under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and on the same day an order of detention was issued and served upon him. The detenue was provided with all facilities in the custody as per Jail Code.  A procession of unruly people numbering about 1500/1600 on 24-2-1996 at 4.40 P.M. led by the detenue and others without provocation attacked 4/5 police constables causing serious bleeding injuries. They also damaged a running mini bus bearing No. Dhaka Metro Ja-11-688 by throwing brick bats and bombs breaking the glass of the said mini bus and thereby they assaulted Kamruzzamn, a Photo Journalist of ‘The Daily Dainik Bangla’. While the detenue and other persons were proceeding towards BNP Office, Naya Paltan, at the instance of the detenue some persons of the said procession assaulted one pedestrian causing injury at 5-30 P.M. and when police on duty tried to rescue the said injured man the detenue along with others threw hand bombs, cocktails, brick bats etc to the police and created lawlessness in the area causing prejudicial activities and they also damaged several vehicles namely, Motor cars bearing Nos. Dhaka Metro- Ja-63-6960, Dhaka Metro Ga-11-3886, Dhaka Metro Ga-2155, Dhaka Metro Cha-7419 and Dhaka Metro Cha-8694 and caused damages to the private and government properties. The detenue held a meeting on 19-3-1997 between 4 to 6 P.M. in front of the National Press Club and with malafide intention delivered exciting and provocative speech and thereby the audience became excited and unruly and threw brick bats and damaged several hotels of the locality including the Hotel Century and also damaged sign board and window glass of the Clinic of the Central Secretariat.  They   also assaulted a local photographer who tried to take photograph of the said incident. The detenue and other leaders tried to dislocate the power generating plants in order to disrupt the electricity supply of the northern part of the country to lower down the image of the government. The detenue also instigated the workers of the Textile and Spinning Mills to create displeasure among them and thereby caused financial loss to the country and for this purpose in their party office the detenue and others held secret meetings with the workers of Bangladesh Biman, Power Supply and Textile and Spinning Mills on 03-03-1997, 10-03-1997 and 12-03-1997 respectively. The detenue by prejudicial activities caused sabotage on 14-3-1997 dismantling a gigantic electric tower of Manoher Khaghapara Power Grid at Pabna. Thus, the deteune indulged in prejudicial acts under the provisions of section 2 (f) (iii), (vi) and (vii) of the Special Powers Act, 1974.<br/> <br/>The writ petitioner -respondent No. 1 filed supplementary-Affidavit and Affidavit-In- Reply denying the allegations made in the Affidavit –In- Opposition filed by the Writ Respondent No. 1-Appellant.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Writ Petition No. 3489 of 1999</u></strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The present respondent No.1, Nurul Amin being the younger brother of the detenue, Azaduddin, as the writ petitioner challenged the detention of the detenue stating, inter alia, that the detenu,  Azaduddin, is a freedom fighter and a University Graduate.  Twice he was elected Chairman of No. 7, Char Alexander Union Parishad under Ramgoti Police Station in the District of Laxmipur. Detenu was arrested on 30-08-1999 under Section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with a prayer for detention and while in custody a detention order being No. 11 of 1999 was made by the District Magistrate, Laxmipur on 01-09-1999 and on the same day grounds of detention were served upon the detenue. Since 1986 there had been political rivalry between the BNP leaders and the J.S.D. leader A.S.M. Abdur Rab who was then the leader of the opposition and at his instance the detenu Azaduddin was arrested under the Special Powers Act, 1974 in 1989.  His detention was declared illegal by the High Court Division. The detenue Azaduddin was arrested under the Special Powers Act, 1974 on 14-10-1996 and his detention was declared illegal by the High Court Division.  Then the detenue Azaduddin was illegally and unlawfully removed from his office as Chairman of the local Union Parishad. Again he was re-elected the Chairman in December, 1997 and took over the charge of the Office of chairman in February, 1998. Then the detenue Azaduddin was falsely implicated in an arms Case on 12.8.1989. But he was acquitted by the Special Tribunal. In the grounds of detention dated 1.9.1999 a list of 14 specific cases and 9 G.D. entries was mentioned. Some cases were dismissed and some ended in final reports. It would be seen that last 8 cases and 7 G.D. entries were related to the period of Parliamentary Elections held in February and June, 1996. In all these cases he was released on bail. It is because of this fact that the detenue was arrested under Section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 30-8-1999 and to remove the detenue from the post of Chairman, and to prevent or obstruct the detenue in arranging his defence in the aforesaid criminal cases the impugned order of detention was passed which is illegal and void. No Affidavit- In- Opposition was filed on behalf of the writ respondent- appellant.<br/> <br/>The High Court Division after hearing all the parties by Judgment and Order dated 7-4-1999  made the Rules Absolute in Writ Petition Nos. 1660 to 1663 of 1997 with direction  upon the writ respondent Nos.1 and 2-appellants to pay compensatory cost of Tk. 1,00,000/- to each of these detenues of 4 writ petitions and by judgment and order dated 29-09-1999 made the rule absolute in Writ Petition No. 3489 of 1999 with direction  upon the writ respondent Nos.1 and 2-appellants to pay compensatory cost of  Tk. 10,000/- to the Detenue and to  release them forthwith.<br/> <br/>The appellants being aggrieved by the impugned judgments and orders of the High Court Division so far as those relate to orders for payment of monetary compensation or compensatory cost exercising jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution, preferred these appeals by leave of this Court.<br/> <br/>Leave was granted in all these appeals to consider the submissions of the learned Attorney General appearing for the appellants that a Court exercising jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution cannot pass an order for payment of compensation or compensatory cost as no such provision has been made in Article 102 of the Constitution and determination of such compensation is dependant  on evidence which is not taken in writ jurisdiction and that the High Court Division exercises writ jurisdiction only on application of  parties and the writ petitioners having not prayed for compensation or compensatory cost  in the writ petitions the High Court Division was wrong in granting the relief of monetary compensation or compensatory cost without such prayer.<br/> <br/>Mr. Murad Reza, the learned Additional Attorney General, in all these appeals made identical submissions to the effect that the High Court Division exercising jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution is not competent to pass an order for payment of compensation or compensatory cost as the constitution itself does not authorise the Court to grant such compensation or compensatory cost and there is no such provisions in Article 102 of the Constitution. He then submits that the awarding and determination of compensation being dependent upon taking evidence which is not taken in writ jurisdiction the High Court Division erred in law in awarding monetary compensation and as such the appeals are liable to be allowed. The learned Additional Attorney General finally submits that the High Court Division having exercised jurisdiction upon application of the parties and the said parties having not prayed for any cost or compensation the High Court Division erred in law awarding compensation.<br/> <br/>Mr. Moudud Ahmed, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondents in Civil Appeal Nos.90-93 of 2000 submits that the High Court Division passed the impugned judgments and orders in exercising jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution for passing orders of monetary compensations or compensatory costs and as such the appeals are liable to be dismissed. Mr. Moudud Ahmed then submits that since the detenues’ fundamental right to freedom  of assembly, right to protection of life and personal liberty as guaranteed by the Constitution have been invaded by the Detaining Authority  under the garb of Special Powers Act, 1974 and that the detention of the detenues is absolutely  illegal and without  lawful authority and that the detenues have been depicted as  leaders of the terrorists and instigators of the saboteurs and thereby caused irreparable damage to their reputation, honour and dignity and that they were deprived  of their normal avocation of life for several  days and that the detentions were malafide and made for political victimization and they have been forced to spend huge sum of money as litigation costs and as such the High Court Division rightly awarded the monetary compensations and compensatory costs to be paid by the appellants to the detenues  and the appeals are liable to be  dismissed.<br/> <br/>We have perused the leave petitions, impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court Division, leave granting order, concise statements filed by the appellants and other materials on record. The first question to decide is whether, the High Court Division in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution is empowered to award monetary compensation or compensatory cost to a victim in a case of the violation of fundamental rights. If the answer is in the affirmative then the next question to answer, is whether on the facts and in circumstances of the instant cases the writ petitioners have made out a case for demand of monetary compensation or compensatory cost. Finally, the question is whether the detenues are entitled to get such compensation or compensatory cost. Generally, the recognized principle of law is that the victims are entitled to get compensation enforced through the civil Court.   The victims can claim compensation in tort for the injury caused to their persons or property. But it takes long time for a victim to get a decree for damages or compensation through civil Courts. The Constitution of Bangladesh guarantees fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution providing remedies for enforcement of such rights. The preamble of the Constitution envisages the fundamental aim of the state for ensuring rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, through democratic process for all citizens. It means substantial degree of economic, political and social equality is to be ensured to the citizens. The Constitution, as stated in the preamble, contemplates a welfare state which has been further strengthened by the fundamental principles of State Policy set out in part II of the Constitution incorporating the economic, social and political objectives of the State which may be described as the conscience of the Constitution. These principles shall be fundamental to the governance of Bangladesh and a guide to the interpretation of the Constitution and other laws of Bangladesh but these shall not be judicially enforceable as contemplated in Article 8 of the Constitution. The right to move the High Court Division in accordance with clause (1) of Article 102 for enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III is guaranteed as per provisions of Article 44(1) of the Constitution.<br/> <br/>At this juncture we are required to expound the ambit and scope of the powers of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. In the case of Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque Vs Bangladesh and others reported in 49 DLR (AD)1 at page 13 Para 40 while interpreting the powers of the High Court Division under Article 102 and dimension of such powers this Court observed as under: ‘‘....................................................................................Article 102 of our Constitution is not an isolated island standing above or beyond the sea-level of the other provisions of the Constitution. It is a part of the over-all scheme, objectives and purposes of the Constitution. And its interpretation is inextricably linked with the (i) emergence of Bangladesh and framing of its Constitution. (ii) the Preamble and Article 7, (iii) Fundamental Principles of State Policy, (iv) Fundamental Rights and (v) the other provisions of the Constitution.’’<br/> <br/>While discussing on point (i) emergence of Bangladesh and framing of its Constitution, this Court in unequivocal terms opined that ‘‘It is the fruit of a historic war of independence, achieved with the lives and sacrifice of a telling number of people of a common cause making it a class part from other Constitutions of comparable description. It is a Constitution in which the people feature as the dominant actor. It was the people of Bangladesh who in exercise of their own self-proclaimed native power made a clean break from the past unshackling the bondage of a past statehood and adopted a Constitution of its own choosing. The Constitution, historically and in real terms, is a manifestation of what is called “the People’s power”. The People of Bangladesh, therefore, are central, as opposed to ornamental, to the framing of the Constitution.’’<br/> <br/>In discussing point (ii) the Preamble and Article 7 this Court observed ‘‘It is in our Constitution a real and positive declaration of pledges, adopted, enacted and given to themselves by the people not by way of a presentation from skilful draftsmen, but as reflecting the ethos of their historic war of independence. Among other pledges ............... .............................................. a pledge to secure for all citizens a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and  justice, political, economic and social and the affirmation of the sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend the Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh are salutary in indicating the course or path that the people wish to tread in the days to come. Article 7 of the Constitution bestows the powers of the Republic with the people and the exercise of the people’s power on behalf of the people shall be affected only under and by the authority of the Constitution. Article 7 does not contain empty phrases.<br/> <br/>It means that all the legislative, executive and judicial powers conferred on the Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary respectively are constitutionally the powers of the people themselves and the various functionaries and institutions created by the  Constitution exercise not their own indigenous and native powers but the powers of the people on terms expressed by the Constitution. The people, again, is the repository of all power under Article 7.”<br/> <br/>As regards point (III) fundamental principles of State policy this court observed that Article 8(2) of the Constitution envisages that the principles set out in Part II of the Constitution shall be a guide to the interpretation of the Constitution and the other laws of Bangladesh. While discussing point (iv) fundamental rights it has been observed that part III of the Constitution enumerates fundamental rights of citizens and other residents of Bangladesh.  On the application of any person aggrieved the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Consititution is empowered to give directions or orders as may be appropriate for the enforcement of fundamental right. The right to move the High Court Division in accordance with Article 102 (1) for the enforcement of fundamental rights is guaranteed as per provision of Article 44 (1). Article 102 (1) is, therefore, termed as mechanism for the enforcement of these rights and Article 102 (1) cannot be divorced from part III of the constitution. As regards point (v) the other provisions of the Constitution it has been observed that these may also come to play a role in interpreting Article 102. Having considered all these forgoing  points this court observed: ‘‘ Article 102 therefore is an instrumentality   and a mechanism, containing both substantive and procedural provisions, by means of which the people as a collective personality, and not merely as a conglomerate of individuals, have devised for themselves a method and manner to realise the objectives, purposes, policies, rights and duties which they have set out for themselves and which they have strewn over the fabric of the Constitution.”<br/> <br/>While discussing the ambit and scope of the powers of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution we have already pointed out that it is a part of the overall scheme, objective and purposes of the constitution and its interpretation is in inextricably linked with the emergence of Bangladesh and framing of the Constitution, the preamble and Article 7, fundamental principles of State policy, fundamental rights and other provisions of the Constitution. The emergence of Bangladesh is the fruit of a historic struggle for national liberation   achieved with the lives and sacrifices of millions of people starting from the Language Movement of 1952, Movement Against the Education Commission’s Report, 1962, Six-Points Movement of 1966 led by Bangabandhu, Eleven Points Movements of Students, 1969, Declaration of Independence on 26<sup>th</sup> March, 1971 followed by the National War of Independence, 1971. In our Constitution people feature as the dominant actor and it is the manifestation of the peoples power. In the preamble of the Constitution, real and positive declaration of pledges adopted and given to themselves by the people reflecting the ethos of the historic struggle for national liberation which is culminated in the national war of independence, 1971. Among other pledges a pledge to secure for all citizens a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social and the affirmation of the sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend the Constitution and to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh are salutary in indicting the cause that the people wish to tread in the days to come.  In the 8<sup>th</sup> Amendment Case 1989 BLD(Spl)1 at page 61 this Court while analysing Article 7 found that it declares the supremacy of the Constitution and that the Supreme Court has “plenary judicial power for maintenance of the Supremacy of the Constitution.” This clearly refers to the plenary power of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court under Article 102 of the Constitution for maintenance of the supremacy of the Constitution by judicial review. In Khandakar Delwar Hossain and others –Vs- Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd and others, 2010 BLD(Spl)1 at page 48 this Court observed that Article 7 is “the touch-stone in the Construction of the Constitution and provides for undoubted supremacy of the Constitution”. Article 7 bestows the power of a Republic with the people and the exercise of the people’s power on behalf of the people shall be exercised only under and by the authority of the Constitution. All the powers conferred on the three organs of the State are constitutionally the people’s power and the various functionaries and institutions created by the Constitution exercise the powers of the people on terms expressed by the Constitution only under and by the authority of the Constitution. Fundamental principles of State policy contained in part II of the Constitution shall be a guide to the interpretation of the Constitution. On the application of any person aggrieved under Article 102(1) of the Constitution the High Court Division is empowered to give directions or orders as may be appropriate for the enforcement of fundamental rights. The right to move the High Court Division in accordance with Article 102(1) for enforcement of fundamental rights is guaranteed as per provisions of Article 44(1) of the Constitution. The other provisions of the Constitution may also come to play a role in interpreting the Article 102 of the Constitution. The powers of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution to enforce fundamental rights as enshrined in Part III of the Constitution is very wide [Government of Bangladesh –Vs-  Ahmed Nazir 27 DLR (AD) 417] . As discussed above it may be termed as the plenary power of the High Court Division. Though the Constitution does not expressly state the nature of the relief which may be granted yet it has been left to the High Court Division to grant the relief according to the circumstances of a given case by exercising its plenary powers under Article 102 of the Constitution to give directions and orders as may be appropriate for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Because Article 102 is an instrumentality and a mechanism by means of which the people   have desired for themselves a method and a manner to realise the objectives, rights and duties which have been set out and strewn over the fabric of the Constitution. The power to grant compensation or compensatory cost is not barred by any provision of the Constitution or any law of the land. The Privy Council in the case of Mahraja -Vs- Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago (1978) 2 All ES 670 held that an order for monetary compensation by way of redress for contravention of the basic human rights and fundamental freedoms can be permitted even though it has not been expressly provided in Section 6 of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago. In this case Lord Diplock observed:- “ The jurisdiction  to make such an order is conferred on the High Court by Para (a) of Section 6(2), viz, jurisdiction to hear and determine any application made by any person in pursuance of Sub-section (1) of this Section.” His Lordship finally observed:  “The claim is not a claim in Private Law for damages for the tort of false imprisonment under which the damages recoverable are at large and would include damages for loss of reputation. It is a claim in Public Law for compensation for deprivation of liberty alone.”   <br/> <br/>Article 102(1) read with Article 44 (1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh and Article 32 of the Indian Constitution convey identical provisions in respect of power of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and the Supreme Court of India respectively for enforcement of the fundamental rights for awarding relief for breach of the fundamental rights committed by the government or any statutory authority. Articles 32 and 226 of the Indian Constitution contemplate the authority and power of the Supreme Court and the High Courts of India respectively to issue whatever direction, order or writs that may be appropriate in a given case for the enforcement of fundamental rights and further under Article 226 for any other purpose which will include the enforcement of public duties by public bodies. Under Article 32(1) of the Indian Constitution right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights is guaranteed which is itself a fundamental right and Article 32 (2) empowers the Supreme Court to issue orders, directions or writs including writs in the natural habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo-warrant, certiorari for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Indian Constitution. On a meticulous examination of the provisions of Article 102 read with Article 44 (1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh and along with the provisions of Article 32 of the Constitution of India it can be seen that Article 32 (1) provides for the right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights conferred by Part III is guaranteed which is identical with the provisions contained in Article 44 (1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh. The provisions of Article 32 (2) of the Constitution of India in effect convey in full the identical provisions of Article 102 of the Constitutions of Bangladesh so far as it relates to the enforcement of the fundamental rights as conferred by Part III of the Constitution of Bangladesh.<br/> <br/>We shall have to examine the case laws to find out whether this Court has affirmed the decisions of the High Court Division disposing of writ petitions by granting any award of monetary compensation or compensatory cost to a victim for violation of fundamental rights. In the case of Government of East Pakistan –Vs- Roushan Bijoya Shawkat Ali khan, 18 DLR (SC) 214 special leave was granted to consider the Constitutional questions raised subject to the conditions that all the costs of the respondents will be borne by the appellant-government and that the question of restoring the detention under the impugned order would be excluded altogether, whatever the result of the appeal. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the appeal would be dismissed and that the appellant would be required to pay the costs of the appeal as already provided for in the admitting order.<br/> <br/>In the case of Government of West Pakistan and others –Vs-Begum Agha Abdul Karim Sherish Kashmiri: 21 DLR (SC) 1 page 16 the Supreme Court observed :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“35. For the reasons, I have given, this appeal must in my view , be dismissed, but having regard to the fact that government has already undertaken to bear the expenses of the respondent for the hearing at Karachi, I would order that costs assessed at Rs. 2,000/00 only be allowed to the respondent in respect of this appeal.</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">36. A question was also raised as to validity of the order of the High Court directing the payment of Rs. 50,000/00 to the respondent for her expenses in this case. Since the transfer of the case to Karachi was at the request of the Government of West Pakistan and the Government had agreed to pay such expenses, I see no necessity of making any order in that behalf. The actual expenses, I have no doubt, will be worked out at the appropriate time on the basis of the relevant rules relating to the taxation of costs in the High Court and adjusted against the amounts, if any, advanced.”    </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>But it is difficult to find out any decision exactly to that point in our jurisdiction. However, any such question was raised for the first time before the Supreme Court of India in the case of Khatri –Vs- State of Bihar reported in (1981) 1 SCC 627 wherein Bhagwati, J, as he then was, observed “why should the court not be prepared to forge new tools and devise new remedies for the purpose of vindicating the most precious of the precious fundamental right to life and personal liberty ’’. In Saint Bir -Vs- State of Bihar (1982) 3 SCC 131 the question of granting compensation to the victim of the lawlessness of the State was left open. The Supreme Court of India in Veena Sethi –Vs- State of Bihar (1982) 2 SCC 583 echoed the same views holding that the question of compensation would still remain open. From the above discussions it can be said that the court had underlined the need for the protection of life and liberty against the violation of the right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution by the State but did not grant any compensation.<br/> <br/>The power of the Indian Supreme Court to pay compensation for infringement of fundamental rights was for the first time recognized in the case of Rudul Shah –Vs- State of Bihar AIR 1983 SC 1086 wherein monetary compensation was granted to a victim of State lawlessness on the part of the Government of Bihar for wrongfully detaining him   in custody for over 14 years after his acquittal from a conviction of murder. He filed a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court for his release from illegal detention<strong>. </strong>He further contended that he was entitled to be compensated for his illegal detention and that the Supreme Court ought to pass an appropriate order for the payment of compensation in the habeas corpus petition itself. The Supreme Court held that his detention in the prison after his acquittal was wholly unjustified and illegal and accordingly released him from detention. Having considered his prayer  for compensation for illegal detention  the Supreme Court further held that the state is liable to pay monetary compensation to the tune of Rs. 30,000/00 as an the interim measure in addition to the sum of Rs 5,000 already paid by it.  While passing the judgment of the Court Chandrachud, C.J. observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“The petitioner could have been relegated to the ordinary remedy of a suit if his claim to compensation was factually controversial, in the sense that a civil court may or may not have upheld his claim. But we have no doubt that if the petitioner files a suit to recover damages for his illegal detention, a decree for damages would have to be passed in that suit, though it is not possible to predicate in the absence of evidence, the precise amount which would be decreed in his favour. In these circumstances, the refusal of this Court to pass an order of compensation in favour of the petitioner will be doing mere lip-service to his fundamental right to liberty which the State Government has so grossly violated. Article 21 which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power of this Court were limited to passing orders of release from illegal detention. One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Article 21 secured, is to mulct its violators in the payment of monetary compensation. Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt. The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the State as a shield. If civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too well known to suffer mention, it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting that, respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy. Therefore, the State must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner’s rights. It may have recourse against those officers.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>While describing the compensation as in the nature of a palliative for giving a better meaning to the right to life under Article 21 Chandrachud C.J. observed in the following terms :-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘‘This order will not preclude the petitioner from bringing a suit to recover appropriate damages from the State and its erring officials. The order of compensation passed by us is, as we said above, in the nature of a palliative. We cannot leave the petitioner penniless until the end of his suit, the many appeals and the execution proceedings.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of M.C. Mehta and another -Vs- Union of India and others reported in AIR 1987 SC 1086 the Supreme Court of India held that under Article 32(1) it is free to devise any procedure appropriate for the particular purpose of the proceeding, namely, enforcement of a fundamental right and under Article 32(2) the court has the implicit power to issue whatever direction, order or writ is necessary in a given case i.e. apart from issuing direction it is empowered under Article 32 to forge new remedies and fashion new strategies designed to enforce the fundamental right. The Court further held that the power under Article 32 is not only confined to preventive measures to injunct infringement of fundamental rights but also includes remedial measures to  entertain  claims for damages for violation of fundamental rights to award compensation in appropriate cases.<br/> <br/>In this case while considering the ambit and scope of the power conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, Bhagwati, C.J. observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         ‘‘It may now be taken as well settled that Article 32 does not merely confer power on this Court to issue a direction, order or writ for enforcement of the fundamental rights but it also lays a constitutional obligation on this Court to protect the fundamental rights of the people and for that purpose this Court has all incidental and ancillary powers including the power to forge new remedies and fashion new strategies designed to enforce the fundamental rights. It is in realisation of this constitutional obligation that this Court has in the past innovated new methods and strategies for the purpose of securing enforcement of the fundamental rights.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Bhagwati, C.J. further observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         ‘‘We are also of the view that this Court under Article 32(1) is free to devise any procedure appropriate for the particular purpose of the proceeding, namely, enforcement of a fundamental right and under Article 32 (1) the Court has the implicit power to issue whatever direction, order or writ is necessary in a given case, including all incidental or ancillary power necessary to secure enforcement of the fundamental right. The power of the Court is not only injunctive  in ambit, that is, preventing the infringement of a fundamental right, but it is also remedial in scope and provides relief against a breach of the fundamental right already committed vide Bandhua Mukti Morcha’s Case, (AIR 1984 SC 802) (supra). If the Court were powerless to issue any direction, order or writ in cases where a fundamental right has already been violated Article 32 would be robbed of all its efficacy, because then the situation would be that if a fundamental right is threatened to be violated, the Court can injunct such violation but if the violator is quick enough to take action infringing the fundamental right, he would escape from the net of Article 32. That would, to a large extent emasculate the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 32 and render it impotent and futile.  We must therefore, hold that Article 32 is not powerless to assist a person when he finds that his fundamental right has been violated. He can in that event seek remedial assistance under Article 32. The power of the court to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases. We are deliberately using the words “in appropriate cases” because we must make it clear that it is not in every case where there is a breach of a fundamental right committed by the violator that compensation would be awarded by the Court in a petition under Article 32. The infringement of the fundamental right must be gross and patent, that is, incontrovertible and ex-facie glaring and either such infringement should be on a large scale affecting the fundamental right of a large number of persons or it should appear unjust or unduly harsh or oppressive on account of their poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position to require the person or persons affected by such infringement to initiate and pursue action in the Civil Courts.  Ordinarily, of course, a petition under Article 32 should not be used as a substitute for enforcement of the right to claim compensation for infringement of a fundamental right through the ordinary process of Civil Court. It is only in exceptional cases of the nature indicated by us above, that compensation may be awarded in a petition under Article 32. This is the principle on which this Court awarded compensation in Rudul Shah Vs. State of Bilhar, AIR 1983 SC 1086. So also, this Court awarded compensation to Bhim Singh, whose fundamental right to personal liberty was grossly violated by the State of Jammu and Kashmir. If we make a fact analysis of the cases where compensation has been awarded by this Court, we will find that in all the cases, the fact of infringement was patent and incontrovertible, the violation was gross and its magnitude was such as to shock the conscience of the Court and it would have been gravely unjust to the person whose fundamental right was violated to require him to go to the Civil Court for claiming compensation.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Article 32 of the Constitution of India lays a constitutional obligation on the Supreme Court to protect the fundamental rights of the people and for that purpose the Court has all incidental and ancillary powers including the power to forge new remedies and fashion new strategies designed to enforce the fundamental rights, especially in the case of the poor and the disadvantaged people who are deprived of their fundamental human rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning. There is no limitation in regard to the kind of proceedings envisaged in Article 32(1) except that the proceedings must be ‘appropriate’- not in terms of any particular form but appropriate with reference to the purpose of the proceedings viz. enforcement of fundamental rights. On a fair construction of Article 32(1), the expression ‘appropriate proceedings’ has reference to proceedings which may be appropriate having regard to the nature of the order, direction or writ which the petitioner seeks to obtain from the court.  Under Article 32 the court has power to award compensation in appropriate cases. However, it is only in exceptional cases of breach of a fundamental right that compensation may be awarded under Article 32. The Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 32 can pass an order for payment of money if such order is in the nature of compensation consequential upon the deprivation of a fundamental right. There is no express provision in the Constitution of India for grant of compensation for violation of a fundamental right. But the Supreme Court has judicially evolved a right to compensation in cases of established unconstitutional deprivation of  life or personal liberty in “appropriate cases” where infringement of the fundamental right is gross and patent, that is, incontrovertible  and  ex-facie glaring or unjust or unduly  harsh or oppressive and its  magnitude was such as to shock the conscience of the Court and  where it would have been gravely unjust to the person whose fundamental right was violated to require him to go to court for claiming compensation.<br/> <br/>Ireland has a written constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights without having any provision of remedy of compensation for the infringement of those rights. The Courts in Ireland  have adapted the same principle like  that of the Indian Courts in awarding monetary compensation against the State for its failure to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen thereby  the Courts of Ireland developed remedies including the award of damages, not only against individuals guilty of infringement, but also against the State itself. In the case of State Vs. Ryan (1965) IR 70 (122) the learned Chief Justice observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         ‘‘It was not the intention of the Constitution in guaranteeing the fundamental rights of the citizen that these rights should be set at naught or circumvented. The intention was that rights of substance were being assured to the individual and that the Courts were the custodians of those rights. As a necessary corollary, it follows that no one can with impunity set these rights at naught or circumvent them, and that the Court’s powers in this regard are as ample as the defence of the Constitution requires.’’  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In Byrne V. Ireland (1972) IR 241 at page to 64, Walsh, J. while speaking about the Constitution of Ireland in respect of the rights of the citizens observed in the following terms:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         ‘‘In several parts of the Constitution, duties to make certain provisions for the benefit of the citizens are imposed on the State in terms which bestow rights upon the citizens and, unless some contrary provision appears in the Constitution, the Constitution must be deemed to have created a remedy for the enforcement of these rights. It follows that, where the right is one guaranteed by the State, it is against the State that the remedy must be sought if there has been a failure to discharge the constitutional obligation imposed.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The Privy Council in the case of Maharaja Vs. Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago, (1978) 2 All ER 670 held that Section 6 of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago does not contain any express provision for payment of monetary compensation but it permitted an order for monetary compensation, by way of redress for contravention of the basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. Lord Diplock observed as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         “It was argued on behalf of the Attorney General that Section 6(2) does not permit of an order for monetary compensation despite the fact that this kind of redress was ordered in Jaundoo Vs. Attorney General of Guyana 1971 AC 972. Reliance was placed on the reference in the sub-section to ‘enforcing, or securing the enforcement of, any of the provisions of the said foregoing sections’ as the purpose for which orders etc. could be made. An order for payment of compensation, it was submitted, did not amount to the enforcement of the rights that had been contravened. In their Lordships’ view an order for payment of compensation when a right protected under Section I ‘has been contravened is clearly a form of redress’ which a person is entitled to claim under Section 6(1) and may well be the only practicable form of redress, as by now it is in the instant case. The jurisdiction to make such an order is conferred on the High Court by Para (a) of Section 6(2), viz. jurisdiction ‘to hear and determine any application made by any person in pursuance of sub-section (1) of this section’. The very wide powers to make orders, issue writs and give directions are ancillary to this.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Lord Diplock further observed:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         “Finally, their Lordships would say something about the measure of monetary compensation recoverable under Section 6 where the contravention of the claimant’s constitutional rights consists of deprivation of liberty otherwise than by due process of law. The claim is not a claim in private law for damages for the tort of false imprisonment, under which the damages recoverable are at large and would include damages for loss of reputation. It is a claim in public law for compensation for deprivation of liberty alone.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Simpson Vs Attorney General (Baigent’s Case) 1994 NZLR 667 the Court of Appeal of New-Zealand while dealing with the enforcement of rights and freedoms as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights for which  no specific remedy was provided, having considered a catena of authorities from different jurisdictions, observed that “the courts are not only to observe the Bill in the discharge of their own duties but are able to grant appropriate and effective remedies where rights have been infringed.” Hardie Boys, J, observed: “ I see no reason to think that this should depend on the terms of a written Constitution. Enjoyment of the basic human rights are the entitlement of every citizen, and their protection is the obligation of every civilized State. They are inherent in and essential to the structure of society. They do not depend on the legal or constitutional form in which they are declared. The reasoning that has led the Privy Council and the Courts of Ireland and India to the conclusions reached in the cases to which I have referred (and they are but a sample) is in my opinion equally valid to the New-Zealand Bill of Rights Act if it is to have life and meaning”.<br/> <br/>In the case of Nilabati Behera Vs. State of Orissa (1993)2 SCC 746 the Supreme Court of India held that its powers of enforcement of fundamental rights imposed a duty to “forge new tools,” of which compensation was an appropriate one where that was the only mode of redress available and this was a remedy in public law based on strict liability for the contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply. In this case damages were awarded by the Supreme Court of India against the State of Orissa to the mother of a victim beaten to death in police custody. The Supreme Court formed the opinion that in awarding a remedy in writ jurisdiction, the Court is required to consider not only the interests of the petitioner and the respondent but also those of the public as a whole with a view to ensuring that public bodies, officials or instrumentaties do not   violate law in discharging their public duty and do not commit any wrong in performing their public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens.  In this case the Supreme Court gave a caution to identify  the situation to which separate proceedings and public law principles apply but with certain amount of circumspection and self restraint, lest proceedings under Article 32 or 226 are misused as a disguised substitute for civil action in private law.<br/> <br/>The Court of Appeal, New Zealand having relied upon the judgments of the Irish Courts and the Privy Council, referred to the principle of law enunciated in Nilabati Behera –Vs- State of Orissa and unanimously held regarding the grant of pecuniary compensation to the victim for the contravention of his rights guaranteed under the Bill of rights Act although there was no express provision to that effect in the Bill of rights.<br/> <br/>From the foregoing discussions and findings it is well established that under Article 32 of the Constitution of India the Court has power to award compensation in appropriate cases. The expression ‘‘appropriate proceedings’’ contemplated in Article 32(1) means a proceeding which may be appropriate having regard to the nature of the order, direction or writ which the petitioner seeks to obtain from the Court. Article 32 envisages a constitutional obligation on the Supreme Court to protect the fundamental rights of the people and to that end in view the Court has all incidental and ancillary powers including the power to forge new remedies and fashion new strategies designed to enforce the fundamental rights, especially in the case of the poor and the disadvantaged people who are deprived of their basic human rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning. The power of the Supreme Court is not only injunctive in ambit, that is, preventing the infringement of a fundamental right, but is also remedial in scope and provides relief against a breach of the fundamental right already committed. The power of the Court to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases. Of course, the infringement of the fundamental rights must be gross and patent, that is, incontrovertible and ex-facie glaring and either such infringement should be on a large scale affecting the fundamental rights of a large number of person, or it should appear unjust or unduly harsh or oppressive on account of their poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position to require the person or persons affected by such infringement to initiate and pursue action in the civil Courts. Generally, a petition under Article 32 should not be used as a substitute for enforcement of the right to claim compensation for infringement of a fundamental right through the ordinary process of Civil Court. It is only in exceptional cases of the nature indicated above, that compensation may be awarded in a petition under Article 32. The Supreme Court has wider power under Article 32(2) to issue whatever direction, order or writ that may be appropriate in a given case for the purpose of enforcement of a fundamental right. There is no express provision in the Constitution of India for grant of compensation for violation of a fundamental right. However, the Supreme Court has judicially evolved a right to compensation in cases of established unconstitutional deprivation of life or personal liberty. The power of the Supreme Court of India under Article 32 and that on the High Courts under Article 226 are plenary powers and are not fettered by any legal constraints. The expressions used in Articles 32 and 226 of the  Constitution of India are very wide and the power of the Supreme court as well as of the High Courts in India extend to issuing   orders, writs, or directions including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, madamus, quo warranto, prohibition and certiorari as may be considered necessary for enforcement of the fundamental rights and further in the case of High Courts, for other purposes as well which means amongst others the enforcement of public duties by public bodies. Article 32 provides in some respects, for effective remedy than Article 226 but the scope of the remedy is clearly narrower because it is restricted solely to enforcement of fundamental right. In the case of Bandhua Mukti Morcha –Vs- U.O.I. reported in AIR 1984 SC. 412 the Supreme Court of India held that the interpretation of Article 32 should be guided not by any verbal or formalistic canons of construction but by the paramount object and purpose for which the article has been enacted and it should be interpreted in the light of the preamble, the fundamental rights  and the Directive Principles. Article 226 is framed/written in a wide language in order not to confine the power conferred by it on the High Courts only to the power to issue prerogative writs. The High Courts exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 can issue ‘directions, orders or writs’ so as to enable the High Courts to reach injustice wherever it is found and to grant the reliefs to meet the peculiar and complicated requirements of the country. The High Court’s power under Article 226 can be exercised when there is any act which is against any provision of law or violative of constitutional provisions and when recourse cannot be had to the  provisions of the Act for the appropriate relief.<br/> <br/>In view of foregoing observations and findings we are of the view that the provisions of Article 102 read with Article 44(1) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh are identical with those of the Article 32 of the Indian Constitution so far as those relate to the enforcement of fundamental rights.  We have already pointed out  that the interpretation of Article 102 should be guided by the paramount object and purpose for which the Article has been enacted and its interpretation is inextricably  linked with the (i)  emergence of Bangladesh and framing of its Constitution, (ii) the preamble and Article 7, (iii)  Fundamental Principles of State Policy, (iv) Fundamental rights and (v) the other provisions of the Constitution. In the Judgment delivered by this Court in the 8<sup>th</sup> Amendment Case,  Article 7  has been termed, as the Pole-Star  of our Constitution  which declares “the supremacy of the Constitution” because  the Supreme Court has been equipped  with plenary  judicial power for maintenance of the  supremacy of the Constitution. In the 5<sup>th</sup> Amendment case this Court has declared Article 7 as the “touch-stone in the construction of the Constitution” which provides for undoubted Supremacy of the Constitution.  Article 7 bestows all powers of the Republic with the people and the various functionaries and institutions including the High Court Division exercise the people’s power on their behalf. The power of the High Court Division under Article 102 is very wide and is not fettered by any legal constaints in the enforcement of the fundamental rights inasmuch as the High Court Division has powers to issue such directions and orders as may be appropriate for the enforcement of fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution. Moreover, Article 44(1) provides that right to move High Court Division under Article 102(1) for the enforcement of fundamental right is also a fundamental right. Therefore, it is the constitutional obligation of the High Court Division to give directions, orders as may be appropriate for the enforcement of fundamental right. The power of the High Court Division under Article 102(1) is not only injunctive in ambit but also remedial in scope to provide any relief against a breach of fundamental right already committed which may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases.  In this context we reiterate with approval the observation of the Supreme Court of India in the case reported in AIR 1987 SC 1086 to the following effect:  “ We are deliberately using   the words ‘in appropriate cases’ because we must make it clear that  it is not  in every case where there is a breach of a fundamental right committed by the violator that compensation would be  awarded by the Court in a petition under Article 32.” In awarding and determination of compensation the High Court Division, in an appropriate case if it deems necessary, may   take evidence to clear any disputed question of facts or pass any direction or orders to  hold an inquiry  by a District Judge for removing any controversy as  was done in the case reported in (1993) 2 SCC 746. Having considered the development of the law regarding compensatory jurisprudence with reference to the experience in India,  Ireland, Privy Council and the Court of  Appeal in New-Zealand, we have no hesitation in holding that  the paramount object and purpose for which Article 102 has been enacted and the relevant factor and provision on which the interpretation of the Article 102 has been linked, the High Court Division in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution, which is an instrumentality and a mechanism, containing both substantive and procedural provisions “ to realise the objectives, purposes, polices, rights and duties which [the people] have set out for themselves and which they have strewn over the fabric of the Constitution,” can award monetary compensation or compensatory cost mostly in appropriate cases for violation of fundamental rights which must be gross and patent i.e. incontrovertible and ex-facie glaring  or that violation should appear unjust, unduly harsh or oppressive on account of the victims disability or personal circumstance. Therefore, the High Court Division should bear in mind the social conditions and circumstances of the country where sometimes wild allegations are being made against the law enforcing agencies, for no fault of their own, alleging gross violation of fundamental rights but at the same time in certain cases excess committed by the law enforcing agencies thereby causing gross violation of fundamental rights cannot be ruled out. That is why the Court has to act firmly but with certain amount of circumspection and self-restraint, lest proceedings under Article 102 are misused as “appropriate cases” or “a disguised substitute for civil action in private law”. It is only in the exceptional cases of the nature indicated above that compensation or compensatory cost may be awarded to a victim in a petition properly drawn under Article 102 of the constitution. The violation must be gross and its magnitude must be such as “to shock the conscience of the Court” and it would be gravely unjust to the person whose fundamental right was violated to require him to go to the Civil Court for claiming compensation. As we have already found the answer to the question No. 1 is in the affirmative then the next question to answer is whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the instant cases, the detenues are entitled to get such compensations or compensatory costs as awarded by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/>On careful scrutiny of the impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court Division and other materials on record the following discrepancies and mistakes have been found:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Court’s observation on confidential report is wrong in facts and law. It appears that such observations of the Court is based on surmises and conjectures, which is not supported   by any evidence or materials on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> There was no allegation of inhuman physical and mental torture of the detenues in the writ petitions and the related affidavits. The High Court Division fully relied on the submissions of the learned Senior Advocate for the writ petitioners and as there was no such allegation the Respondent-Government had no opportunity to refute the same allegations of   physical and mental torture in jail custody. The writ petitioners neither in the writ petitions nor in the Supplementary Affidavits nor in the Affidavits-In-Reply made any specific statement regarding inhuman mental and physical torture on the detenues in jail custody with supporting materials and as such the High Court Division acted without lawful authority in taking such submissions into consideration in passing the impugned judgments and orders in the absence of such statements made by the writ petitioners.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There was no statement in the writ petitions, Supplementary–Affidavits and Affidavits-In-Reply to the effect that the detenues were not provided with minimum facilities according to their status in jail custody for several days. This allegation was for the first time made by the learned Senior Advocate for the writ petitioners in his submissions before the High Court Division. Moreover, the writ respondent-appellant had no opportunity to controvert those statements as the same was not made in the writ petitions and the related affidavits.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As no prayer was made regarding exemplary monetary costs or monetary compensations in the writ petitions and related affidavits, the High Court Division erred in law in fully relying on the submissions of the learned Senior Advocate for the writ petitioners in passing the orders for monetary compensation or compensatory costs and as such they said orders have been made without lawful authority and are liable to be set aside. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">On careful scrutiny of the writ petitions, impugned judgments, Affidavits-In-Opposition and other relevant documents on record it appears that there was no allegation of physical and mental torture. Apart from the vague and indefinite allegations without any supporting documents that the detenues were in inhuman condition in the Jail there was no other statement in the writ petitions. The submission of Mr. Moudud Ahmed before the High Court Division is bereft of any merit and without having any basis or statement to that effect in the writ petitions it raised disputed question of facts not being supported by any sworn affidavit or admitted facts or material evidence on record.  However, considering the facts and circumstance of the case, we are of the view that there was no malice on the part of the appellants as alleged by the writ petitioners in the writ petitions and the violation of fundamental right was not being gross and patent and ex-facie glaring or the violation was not unjust and unduly harsh or oppressive the High Court Division erred in law in awarding monetary compensation and compensatory cost which cannot be passed unless it is specifically proved and claimed in an appropriate case as stated above. The writ petitioner failed to make out an appropriate case and as such the impugned decision of the High Court Division in awarding a lump sum monitory compensation in each of these cases must be held to have been made without lawful authority. It is unfortunate to note with utter disgust that the learned Judges of the High Court Division have taken upon themselves the responsibility in purportedly making out a case of inhuman physical and mental torture without any basis. This kind of misadventure of the concerned Judges of the High Court Division while passing and making such orders with total non-application of mind is fully disapproved. In these cases the conduct of the learned Judges is highly disapproved. It is difficult to reconcile why the High Court Division has invented causes of compensations or compensatory costs in these cases where the writ petitioners had not made out such cases and even no such basis or statements and prayers were ever made in  all of the  writ petitions. It is expected that a court should not make any sweeping remark or irrelevant observation in a case and identify itself to the cause of any of the parties to a case on which it is adjudicating. In the writ petitions no statement was made on the issue of allegedly not providing minimum facilities to the detenues while in custody for several days. Such submissions of the learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners were not supported by any evidence and statement to that effect made in the writ petitions is nothing but after thought.<br/> <br/>In the case of Hefzur Rahman (Md) -Vs- Shamsun Nahar Begum and another reported in 51 DLR (AD) page 172, this Court observed as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         “The law requires that the relief must be specifically claimed either simply or in the alternative. It is true that general or other relief which the Court may think just may be granted although not specifically asked for. But the essential conditions are that, the averments in the plaint must justify such relief and the defendant must get an opportunity to contest such relief. In the name of granting general or other relief the Court cannot and would not mount any surprise on the defendant and make him liable for something which does not arise out of the plaint and, as such, he had no occasion to answer the same. This is merely an extension of the principle of natural justice.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the instant cases, it appears that neither in the writ petitions, nor in the Supplementary Affidavits nor in the Affidavits-In- Reply the writ petitioners made any statement regarding the so-called inhuman mental and physical torture of the detinues in the jail custody as alleged by Mr. Moudud Ahmed the learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners, in his submissions. The High Court Division acted without lawful authoring in taking into consideration such submissions in the absence of any basis or statements to that effect made by the petitioners in the writ petitions and connected affidavits. The High Court Division erred in law in making the observation that the learned State lawyer did not even dare to refute such allegations brought by Mr. Ahmed where there was no such case was made out and no such statements were ever made in the writ petitions. It is unfortunate to note that the High Court Division failed to take notice of the fact that the detenues were not the petitioners in those cases and that the learned Additional Attorney General appearing for the Government had no obligation to refute any allegation of fact disclosed in the submissions of the learned Senior Advocate for the writ petitioners unless the same was stated in the writ petitions, the Supplementary-Affidavits and the Affidavits-In-Reply with supporting materials. The High Court Division therefore acted without jurisdiction in relying on the submissions of Mr. Moudud Ahmed as the basis for awarding compensation. In the case of Bangladesh-Vs- Chairman, Court of Settlement and others reported in 51 DLR (AD) 87 at page 88 Para 2 this Division  approved the submission of the writ respondent to the following effect:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“In awarding cost, particularly, if it be a very heavy one like in the present case, the Court should give reasons otherwise it may appear to be an arbitrary or indiscreet exercise of discretion.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>In view of the  established principle of law that the Court should assign a reason in awarding cost or compensation otherwise it may appear to be arbitrary or indiscreet exercise of power or discretion with regard to realization of the same, the impugned order directing the defendant-Government mainly the respondent Nos. 1-2  to pay compensation or compensatory cost to the detenues in the writ petitions  for detaining them with the alleged ground of malafide intention is arbitrary or indiscreet exercise of power or discretion and as such the impugned orders have been passed without lawful authority. In the case of Bangladesh –Vs. Sheikh Hasina 60 DLR (AD) 90 at Para 44-46, this Court held that the relief must be specifically claimed but in the name of “general or other relief” the Court cannot and would not mount any surprise on the defendant and make  him liable for something which does not arise out of the plaint and, as such, he had no occasion to answer the same. On the facts and in the circumstances of these instant cases, neither the appellant Government nor the Government servants be specially made liable to pay compensations to the detenues.<br/><br/>We have already found that in these instant cases,  there was no foundation in the writ petitions or prayer for exemplary, monetory compensation and compensatory costs was ever made in the writ petitions  and connected  affidavits rather on the prayer of the learned Senior Advocate for the writ petitioners the  learned Judges of the High Court Division on mere surmises and conjectures wrongly observed “We being satisfied upon the material on record hold the view that it is a fit case where justice demand an exemplary monetary compensation for the detenue from the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2.” But the learned Judges of the High Court Division failed to refer to any such material on record because there was no such foundation in the writ petitions and connected affidavits and in fact no such material on record was found in the instant cases. It is well established that compensation or relief must be specifically prayed for in the writ petition but not in the name of general or other relief. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that the impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court Division have been made without any lawful authority.<br/><br/>Accordingly, we find merit in all these appeals.<br/><br/>In the result, all these appeals are allowed. The impugned Judgments and Orders passed by the High Court Division in the aforesaid writ petitions so far as those relate to the payment of lump sum monetary  compensation of Tk. 1,00,000/-(Taka One lakh only) to each of the detenues in writ petition Nos. 1960 to 1963 of 1997 to be paid by the Writ Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and compensatory cost of Tk.10,000/- (Taka ten thousand only) to the detenue in Writ Petition No. 3489 of 1999  to be paid by the Writ Respondent No. 2 are hereby set aside. <br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Rezaul Hasan, J. </u></strong><br/> <br/>This is an application under section 233 of the Companies Act, 1994 (the Act).<br/><br/>It appears from the statements made in the petition that the Company has been incorporated on 11.5.1997, vide Certificate of Incorporation dated 11.5.1997, under the Companies Act with 4 subscribers, subscribing for total 2000 numbers shares of Tk.100 each. These 4 subscribers each has subscribed for 5,000 shares equally. Article 14 and Article 26 of the Articles of Associations contains provisions to from quorum requiring presence of all 4 Members, for holding the General Meetings as well as for holding the meetings of the Board of Directors. It further appears that on 23.04.2012 a notice was issued by the Respondent No.2 (Chairman of the Respondent Company) convening an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) fixing 15.5.2012, to alter the provisions of article 14 and article 26 regarding the quorum for holding general meetings and board meetings. Hence this application, alleging that the respondent No. 2 and the respondent No.3, who were ex-colleagues in PWD, intends to bring the company under the control of an axis and that the resolution is likely to be passed, since the respondent No. 2 has a casting vote. It is also apprehended that, interest of the petitioner is likely to be prejudiced by discriminatory treatment to be done to him.<br/><br/>Learned Advocate Mr. A. K. M. Badrudduza, appearing for the petitioner, having placed the application, submits that the aforesaid notice was issued for calling an EGM although the Board of directors has not taken any decision to call any EGM for amendment of article 14 and Article 26 and as such the said notice was called without any lawful authority and with ulterior motive to grab 100% controlling power by the respondents. He next submits that the Respondent No.2 is trying to form exits of 2 directors and if they are allowed to form a quorum then the resolution to be passed is likely to discriminate the interest of the petitioner. He finally submits the proposed resolution is most likely to be adopted as because the Respondent No. 2 has casting vote. Therefore he has prayed that the notice dated 23.4.2012 convening the EGM on 15.5.2012 proposing to reduce the quorum required to hold the General Meetings and Board Meetings by altering Articles 14 and 16 of the Articles of Association is liable to be cancelled and that direction may be given upon Respondent No.2, 3 and 4 not to hold the EGM on 15.05.2012 or on any other date to amend the aforesaid articles in the manner as proposed.<br/><br/>The learned Advocate Mr. Rais Uddin Ahmed, appearing for the Respondent Nos. 2 and 5, on the other hand submits that the petitioner has not come in clean hands before this court. He further submits that the company will run into stalemate if the provisions regarding quorum is kept as it is, presently requiring the personal presence of all 4 members, in person, for holding the General Meetings as well as for holding the Board Meetings. The meeting was called in the interest of the Company and if the meeting decides to alter Article 14 and 26, as proposed, it will in no way prejudice the interest of the petitioner. He has accordingly prayed for dismissal of this matter.<br/>Heard the learned Advocates and perused the application, the affidavit-in-opposition along with the annexures.<br/><br/>It appears that the company is formed in the year 1997, vide the Certificate Incorporation No. C32898 (2019)/97 dated 11.05.1997, and that the petitioner was one of the 4 subscribers, each subscriber having subscribed for 5000 shares of Taka 100 each. The company has been formed with authorized capital of Tk. 1,00,00,000/- ( Taka one crore) divided into 1,00,000/- (Taka one lac) shares of Tk. 100 each. It further appears from article 14 and article 16 of the Article of Association (AOA) of the company that personal presence of all 4 members is required to hold any General Meeting as well as for holding the Board Meetings. Article 14 and 16 reads as follows: “১৪ সাধারণ সভায় কোম্পানীর সমস¹ কার্য বিবরণী ও প্রনালী গ্রহণ করতে ৪(চার) জন সদস্য উপসিহত থাকতে হবে সাধারণ সভায় কোন কার্যত্র্রম শুর্র হবার সময় সদস্যদের কোরাম না হইলে ঐ সাধারণ সভায় কোন কার্যত্র্রম গ্রহণ করা যাবে নাzঞ্জ ঞ্ছ২৬z পরিচালকমন্ডলীর সভায় কোম্পানীর সমস¹ কার্যবিবরনী ও প্রণালী গ্রহণ করতে ৪ জন পরিচালক উপসিহত থাকতে হবে এবং ৪ জন পরিচালক উপসিহত হলে কোরাম পূর্তি সংখ্যা হয়েছে ধরতে হবে ”.<br/><br/>It further appears from the record that the cause of action for filing the application has arisen following notice dated 10.5.2012 (Annexure-B), proposing to change the quorum required for holding the general meetings and the board meetings, by altering Article 14 and Article 26, respectively. The proposal was to reduce the presence of the members/directors from 4 to 2 for making the quorum. The petitioner apprehends that the resolution is likely to be adopted pursuant to the aforesaid notice dated 10.5.2012, particularly when the Respondent No.2 has a casting vote as per Article 15 of the AOA and that if resolution is allowed to be passed then his interest is likely to be discriminated, albeit he is one o the original subscribers.<br/><br/>I<strong>t is to be noted here that the jurisdiction</strong><strong> under section 233 of the Act is regulatory </strong><strong>and preventive in nature and this jurisdiction</strong><strong> is to be exercised to protect interest of the </strong><strong>minority shareholders from being prejudiced</strong><strong> by the majority shareholders as well as to prevent mismanagement as regards the affairs of the company, either by majority of the members or by the directors of the company. This jurisdiction, conferred by section 233 of the Act, thus practically negotiates the rule founded in Foss vs. Harbottle: (1843) 2 Hare 461.</strong> This rule, which has two strands, firstly, precludes a shareholder from bringing an action to pursue wrongs which has been done to the company. Secondly, where there are irregularities in the way the company is run, and also in many cases where directors are in breach of their duties, the majority shareholder in general meetings may, by ordinary resolution, ratify what has been done. In those circumstances the court will not allow a minority shareholder to bring an action perusing a matter which it is competent for the majority to approve on behalf of the company.<br/><br/>Existing Article 14 and 16 keeping provisions for 4 members to remain personally present to form the quorum for holding General Meetings and the Board Meetings, respectively, can also create stalemate in the business and functioning of the company. <strong>Even if the 4 members do adopt an unanimous resolution that can also be prejudicial to the interest of the company in its transaction of business with the 3<sup>rd</sup> parties or even in doing or ratifying an ultravires act. In such circumst-ances section 233 has invested this court with wide powers to pass appropriate orders as permitted by the clauses (a) (b) and (c) to sub-section (3) of section 233 of the Act</strong>.<br/><br/>In view of the deliberation recorded above this petition merits to be allowed in part with necessary direction.<br/><br/>In the result i) the impugned notice dated 23.04.2015 (Annexure-B), convening an EGM (fixing 15.5.2012) proposing to alter the provisions of Articles 14 and 16 regarding the quorum for holding the General Meetings and the Board Meetings, by reducing presence of 2 members instead of 4 members, is hereby cancelled, ii) the petitioner and other respondents, who are directors of the Company is hereby directed to call a board meeting for holding an EGM and to hold an EGM  accordingly to adopt a special resolution reducing presence of 4 members to 3 for constituting a quorum for holding the general meetings and the meetings of the board of directors and to alter the provisions of Article 14 and 16, respectively, of the Articles of Association of the respondent 5 company, by following proper procedure to be followed for effecting such alteration as per law. They shall also file copies of the resolution in the office of the Registrar of the Joint Stock Companies and Firms, as required by law. iii) The direction shall be complied with within 6 weeks from the date of the receipt of the copy of this order.<br/><br/>The petitioner and 3 other respondent i.e. all 4 directors should submit an affidavit of compliance within 1(one) week after effecting the alterations as per direction made above.<br/><br/>This court records its appreciation of the commendable assistance rendered by the learned advocates appearing for both sides.<br/><br/>         This matter shall stand disposed off upon receiving and accepting the affidavit of compliance as mentioned above.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Although it is pertinent to note that the Education Ministry, therefore the respondent No. 3 is time and again superseding the authority of the Education Board, Dhaka which was established under the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance (Ordinance No. 33 of 1961), 1961. The Ministry of the Education by passing such authority frequently issuing circulars and orders in total disregard to the constitutional mandate. If we look into the circular dated 04.01.2003, this circular was issued by a Senior Assistant Secretary at his own accord without mentioning under whose authority he has issued the circular direction, which is in total violation of the Constitutional provision embraced in Article 55(4) of the Constitution and apart from that Article 31 of the Constitution clearly emphasises the provision that a citizen’s right be protected in accordance with law and only in accordance with law. . . .(41)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>Dhaka Education Board was established in 1961 as an independent body to control and supervises its own affairs but in total disregard to an Act of Parliament, i.e. the Ordinance No. 33 of 1961, the Education Ministry, i.e. respondent No. 3, is supervising and controlling it and issued the grading system and the circular dated 04.01.2003, which is also in total disregard to the Ordinance No. 33 of 1961, therefore the circular dated 04.01.2003 is issued without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. . . .(42)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>The paramount contention in the instant writ petition is with regard to supplying of mark sheet elaborately specifying the marks obtained by an examinee subject wise, as was done previously before introduction of the present system.

The petitioner prayed to the Board for re-scrutiny of his result on payment of Tk.300 x 4 = 1200/- on 18.07.2010 through Teletalk Mobile Phone Services and was waiting eagerly for the response from the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka (Dhaka Board) but unfortunately till date the Dhaka Education Board has not given any response to the same.<br/><br/>Finding no way out, the father of the petitioner most humbly requested the respondent No. 2, the Controller of Examinations of Dhaka Board by an application dated 30.09.2010 praying to supply him the mark-sheet of his son assuring that he is ready to bear all expenses for supply of marks-sheet, and the said application dated 30.09.2010 was sent by registered post with acknowledgement due (annexure- C and C-1).<br/><br/>The respondent No. 2 by a letter under memo No. ৬৮৮/উঃমাঃপঃ ২০০১/৩৮৭ dated 30.11.2010, informed this petitioner that as per direction of the Ministry of Education contained in প্রজ্ঞাপন নং শিম/শাঃ১০/৭ পরীক্ষা২ (গ্রেডিং)/২০০২/৬১০, তারিখ ০৪/০১/২০০৩ the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are unable to supply marks sheet but the respondent No. 2 did not enclose that প্রজ্ঞাপন with his reply, as such, the petitioner remained in darkness about the contents of the প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003 in question (annexure– N).<br/><br/>The petitioner did not know the contents of the said প্রজ্ঞাপন নং- শিম/শাঃ ১০/৭ পরীক্ষা-২ (গ্রেডিং)/২০০২/৬১০ dated 04.01.2003. Thereafter father of the petitioner met with the Chairman of the Dhaka Board, respondent No. 1, and requested to provide a copy of the প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003. Accordingly, the respondent No. 1 provided him with a photostat copy of the said প্রজ্ঞাপন নং শিম/শাঃ ১০/৭ পরীক্ষা-২ (গ্রেডিং)২০০২/৬১০ dated 04.01.2003, which provides for the introduction of grading system in S.S.C., H.S.C. and Alim Examinations in Bangladesh, which is done violating the provisions of the Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, (E.P. Ordinance No. XXXIII of 1961), which is <em>ultra vires</em> to the said Ordinance; moreover, that প্রজ্ঞাপন is a mere circular of the শিক্ষা মলয়ন only, which has got no legal basis and that circular প্রজ্ঞাপন cannot be treated as a law of the country. The Education Ministry has not been authorized by any law to frame or issue any such circular and hence the said প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003 has got no legal enforceability, so the said প্রজ্ঞাপন is not binding upon this petitioner as an examinee under the Dhaka Board (annexure- M).<br/><br/>The said প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003 issued by the Ministry of Education did not prohibit the issuance of mark-sheet to the examinees. On the contrary, since time immemorial in our country full result of all broad based on examinations are expressed and given through mark-sheet and every examinee gets mark-sheet as an end result of such an examination is a customary right of the petitioner. The respondents have no reasonable excuse to refuse to give marks-sheet in as much as the result is prepared on the basis of marks-sheet.<br/><br/>The S.S.C., H.S.C. and Alim Examinations are recognized public examinations and records are prepared and made out of the examinations are all public records according to law. Therefore, the tabulation sheet is also a public record. All these are meant for public use and purposes, as such, if any citizen needs such record for his/her use, it is the duty of the public authority to provide the mark-sheet, which is a public record, to the person who asks for it. The তথ্য অধিকার আইন ২০০৯ has guaranteed right to an examinee to get his mark-sheet as per ones desire and demand it from the Dhaka Board and they have no right to refuse it.<br/><br/>The said প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003 shows that the Education Boards were directed to publish result of examination in terms of Grade Points (GP) but there is no bar in giving marks-sheet on demand. Father of the petitioner then wrote another letter to the respondent Nos.1 and 2 on 11.01.2011 stating that in said প্রজ্ঞাপন (notification) dated 04.01.2003 there is no bar in giving marks-sheet; and again the father of the petitioner requested to give marks-sheet of the petitioner and the letter was sent by registered post with acknowledgement (annexure- F and F-1). <br/><br/>The respondent No. 2 by letter dated 23.01.2011 advised father of the petitioner to apply for information asking for mark-sheet in the prescribed form under the তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ (annexure- G). The father of the petitioner then on 09.03.2011 submitted application in form L prescribed by the তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ to the respondent No. 2 for marks-sheet, sent under registered post with acknowledgement (annexure- H and H-1), however, that has remained unanswered. The father of the petitioner again on 23.04.2011, sent another application to the respondent No.1 in form “N” of the তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ asking for marks-sheet, which was also sent under registered post with acknowledgement. The relevant provision of the তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯, read as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><br/>(ক) ধারাঃ ৪ তথ্য অধিকার ২ অধ্যায়ঃ<br/>কর্তৃপ­ক্ষর নিকট হই­ত প্র­ত্যক নাগরি­কর তথ্য লা­ভর অধিকার থাকি­ব এবং কোন নাগরি­কর অনু­রা­ধর প্রেক্ষি­ত সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্তৃপক্ষ তাহা­ক তথ্য সরবরাহ করি­ত বাধ্য থাকি­ব<br/>(খ) ধারা- ৩ঃ তথ্য অধিকার আই­নর প্রাধান্যঃ<br/>ক) তথ্য প্রদান সং্রা বিধানাবলী এই আই­নর বিধানাবলী দ্বারা ক্ষুন্ন হই­ব না; এবং<br/>খ) তথ্য প্রদা­ন বাধা সং্রা বিধানাবলী এই আই­নর  বিধানাবলীর সহিত সাংঘর্ষিক হই­ল, এই আই­নর বিধানাবলী প্রাধান্য পাই­বz (annexure –J and J-1).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>The petitioner wants to go abroad for higher education and for such admission in any foreign educational institution mark-sheet of the petitioner in S.C.C. and H.S.C. examinations will be required in addition to GPA result. The respondents have no legal or moral right to refuse to give marks sheet to the petitioner as the same would deprive him from the benefits, which he is entitled to get on the basis of mark-sheet; ultimately the fundamental right of this petitioner effects seriously in all respect.<br/><br/>Thereafter a Notice Demanding Justice was sent by the father of the petitioner to the respondents demanding justice on 18.08.2011 by registered post through his lawyer, as yet, the respondents remained silent till date (annexure- K and K-1).<br/><br/>The petitioner filed Writ Petition No. 8836 of 2011, praying for a direction on the respondents to issue marks sheet to the petitioner. A Division Bench of this Court after hearing the said writ petition as a motion found it improper to issue Rule unless the প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003 is impugned and therefore the petitioner had to pray that he does not press the petitioner as it was framed.<br/><br/>The respondent, Dhaka Board has re-scrutinized around 107 candidates of the Higher Secondary Certificate (Science Group)- 2010 Examination result by way of correction and ultimately altered the result finally published on 15.07.2010 and re-issued their Academic Transcript afresh by putting fresh and new results. And out of that re-scrutinized result more than 42 of the candidates were given GPA-5.00 excepting this petitioner, which is discriminatory, <em>mala-fide</em> and is also repugnant to the equality of doctrine as enshrined in Article 27, 28 and 31 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>It is due to the wilful and deliberate negligence, in as much as, planned partiality of the respondents the petitioner’s prayer for re-scrutiny have been kept pending and overthrown till date without assigning any reasons on  the other hand the petitioner paid Tk.1200.00 (one thousand and two hundred) as re-scrutiny fees in time for four (04) subjects, i.e. (1) Bangla (2) English, (3) Chemistry and (4) Mathematics; ultimately the petitioner’s result kept hidden and in darkness till this date despite repeated prayer and persuasion.<br/><br/>These ill motives, as well as, manipulations of the respondents has deprived the petitioner from his legal and constitutional right to know the actual root where he is standing out of that Public Examinations like Higher Secondary Certificate Examination-2010 (Science Group) and non-consideration of the petitioner’s prayer for re-scrutiny has not been done with ulterior motive of the respondent, which just stands on the way of Higher Education of the petitioner and thus put a bar to the petitioner who intends to go abroad, which has already affected him seriously to his fundamental right as guaranteed under the Constitution, guaranteed in Articles 27, 31, 32 and 44.<br/><br/>Once a revised result by way of alternation is published subsequently by way of making re-scrutiny in that case this petitioner prayer should have to be taken into positive consideration without any question and taking any negative attitude, otherwise the entire re-scrutiny of 107 candidates should have to be cancelled without raising any lame excuses.<br/><br/>The claim of the petitioner is only 0.70 decimals of points to realize which less than just 1.00 decimals marks only. Therefore, the petitioner’s prayer cannot be thrown out of by careless mistakes of the respondents, which is a mere negligence and at this stage this mistakes deserves positive consideration by way of re-scrutiny/re-examination without any more delay.<br/><br/>More so, it is to be said that the respondent Dhaka Board did not apply their official power which seems to be arbitrary and that is why this petitioner’s case has been over thrown, as well as, deserted as yet today. The respondents remained silent without giving any reply to this petitioner’s all written representations and prayer and non-compliance of the Court’s order dated 14.11.2011 which is another conspiracy and colourful offence of the respondents and is a violation of petitioner’s right which is guaranteed by the Constitution.<br/><br/>The respondent Nos. 1 and 2 contested the Rule, contending <em>inter alia</em> that so far the date of result of the examination is concerned, it was published on 15.07.2010, which is correct and the statements to the effect that the petitioner got academic transcript without specific marks is misleading, misconstrued and misconceived, as such, his prayer for according him GPA 5.0 instead of 4.30 has been denied. It is very pertinent to note that according to the notification being No. শাঃ ১১/১০৯১৮/২০০১/২৬৭-শিক্ষা dated 12.03.2001 and subsequent amendment of the said notification being No. শিম/শাঃ ১০/৭ পরীক্ষা-২/(গ্রেডিং)/২০০২/৬১০ dated 04.01.2003, the respondent No.1 and 2 have no legal authority to issue marks sheet. The relevant portion of the notification dated 12.03.2001 embraces as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">সরকার মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক স¹­রর পাবলিক পরীক্ষার ফলাফল লেটার গ্রেডিং পদ্ধতির প্রকা­শর সিদ্ধা¿¹ গ্রহন ক­র­ছz এ ল­ক্ষ্য ২০০১ সা­ল অনুষ্ঠিতব্য মাধ্যমিক স্কুল সার্টিফি­কট পরীক্ষা এবং ২০০৩ সা­ল অনুষ্ঠিতব্য উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক সার্টিফি­কট পরীক্ষা থে­ক ফলাফথ লেটার গ্রেডিং পদ্ধতি­ত প্রকাশিত হ­বz এ বিষ­য় নি­ম্নাও্র সিদ্ধা¿¹ অনুসরন কর­ত  হ­বz<br/>(ক) পরীক্ষার উত্তী­র্ণর কোন বিভাগ উ­ল্লখ থাক­ব না শুধু প্রতি বিষ­য় প্রাপ্ত লেটার গ্রেড এবং সকল বিষ­য় প্রাপ্ত Grade Point (GP) এর ভিত্তি­ত পরীক্ষার্থীর Grade Point Average (GPA) উ­ল্লখিত থাক­বz লেটার মার্ক ও মার্ক প্রদান এবং মেধা তালিকা প্রনয়ন বা প্রকাশ ইত্যাদি প্রচলিত প্রথা থাক­ব না</div><div style="text-align: justify;">        <br/>Hence no specific marks could be supplied.<br/> <br/>It is stated that the statements made with regard to the petitioner’s application dated 11.01.2011 (annexure- F) and statement in that regard in the petition is a departure from the statements made in the said application as the relevant portion of the statements made in his application dated 11.01.2011, is as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>       স্মতর্ব্য, অতি সঙ্গতকার­ণই নিম্ন স্বাক্ষরকারী নম্বরপত্র (Mark Sheet) চে­য় আপনা­দর নিকট আ­বদন ক­র­ছ এবং নম্বরপ­ত্রর (Mark-sheet) খরচাদি বহন কর­ত রাজী হ­য়­ছz আপনা­দর নি­র্দশ পে­ল নম্বর প­ত্রর (Mark-sheet) সমস খরচাদি অগ্রীম আপনা­দর অফি­স জমা দেয়া হ­ব এ বিষ­য় নিম্ন স্বাক্ষীরকারী আপনা­দর নিকট প্রতিশ্রুতিবদ্ধ এবং বাধ্যz এখন প্রার্থনা হ­চ্ছ, হয় নম্বরপত্র GPA-5 দয়া ক­র ইস্যু করুন নতুবা এই পরীক্ষার্থী ০|৭০ নম্বর পুরন ক­র দি­য় রেজাঢ~ প্রদান করুনz এটাই আমার আরিক ও বিনীত নি­বদন আপনা­দর সক­লর প্রতি</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Since the board has no authority to increase the Grading Point, so his prayer could not be allowed. The board has no authority to give result by adding 0.70 marks over the existing result of 4.30 GPA number. The board cannot fulfil such demand at the sweet-will of the petitioner. And it is further stated that the petitioner was given reply through SMS earlier and his result are available in website of Dhaka Board.<br/><br/>The existing rules/regulation and system of the Dhaka Board are contrary to the petitioner’s claim and hence the request of the father of the petitioner could not be acceded to and it is stated in this connection that respondent No. 2 is responsible for ensuring and maintaining strict secrecy of all information regarding the examination of the Board as per Regulation 3(2)(iv) of the Schedule to the First Regulations of the Board provided in the Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961, as such, since the fË‘¡fe (Notification) being a limited public document is available everywhere, so the petitioner’s demand was to supply him mark sheet which could not be done under the existing system of the Board/Government and hence it was denied.<br/><br/>The claim to the effect that the said প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) dated 04.01.2003 introducing grading system in S.S.C., H.S.C. and Alim Examinations in Bangladesh violating the provisions of the Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance (E.P. Ordinance No. XXXIII of 1961) is <em>ultra-vires</em> to the said Ordinance is not correct. The প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) is a circular of the শিক্ষা ম¿»নালয়ন (Education Ministry) which has got no legal basis and that circular প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) cannot be treated as a law of the country is also misleading and misconceived as according to Article 152 of the Constitution প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) has been defined as law. The Education Ministry representing the Government has every authority to frame law and issue প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) and the Education Board is the instrument for implementation of those প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification). The তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ has not given the petitioner such right as to obtain for him the  subject wise marks instead of Grade Point.<br/><br/>The petitioner earlier filed Writ Petition No. 8830 of 2011 praying for direction on the respondents to issue mark sheet to the petitioner. A Division Bench of this Court after hearing the said writ petition as a motion found it improper to issue Rule unless the প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) dated 04.01.2003 is impugned and the petitioner did not press the petition. As per notification প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) dated 12.03.2001 and 04.03.2003 the Board, respondent Nos.1 and 2, has got no legal authority to supply/ give mark sheet to the petitioner, as the preamble of the notification dated 12.03.2001 provides, সরকার মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক স¹­রর পাবলিক পরীক্ষার ফলাফল ­লটার গ্রেডিং পদ্ধতি­ত প্রকা­শর সিদ্ধা গ্রহন ক­র­ছ এ ল­ক্ষ্য ২০০১ সা­ল অনুষ্টিতব্য উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক সার্টিফি­ক­ট পরীক্ষা এবং ২০০৩  সা­ল অনুষ্ঠিতব্য উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক সার্টিফি­কট পরীক্ষ্য থে­ক ফলাফল লেটার গ্রেডিং পদ্ধতি­ত প্রকাশিত হ­বz এ বিষ­য় নি­ম্নাও্র সমূহ অনুসরণ কর­ত হ­বz and clause ‘Ka’ of the said  notification provides, পরীক্ষার উত্তী­র্ণর কোন বিভাগ উ­ল্লখ থাক­ব নাz শুধু প্রতি বিষ­য় প্রাপ্ত লেটার গ্রেড এবং সকল বিষ­য় প্রাপ্ত Grade Point (GP) এর ভিত্তি­ত পরীক্ষার্থীর Grade Average (GPA) উ­ল্লখ থাক­বz লেটার মার্ক ও Öঢ~ার মার্ক প্রদান এবং মেধা তালিকা প্রনয়ন বা প্রকাশ ইত্যাদি প্রচলিত প্রথা থাক­ব নাz” and as the regulation 3(2) (IV) of the Schedule to the First Regulation of the Board under the Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961 provides that the respondent No. 2 as Controller of Examination, Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka shall be responsible for ensuring and maintaining strict secrecy of all information regarding the examination of the Board, the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 cannot be made responsible for gross negligence and alleged harassment made to the petitioner by not issuing mark sheet,  and sine they follows the notification, a provisions of law, so it did not caused harassment to the petitioner by not issuing mark sheet, and as such, nobody having violated any provision of law, and therefore is not subject to any disciplinary action. And in reply to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2, the petitioner stated that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 regarding publication of Examinations result dated 15.07.2010 and this petitioner got plain academic transcript without specific marks from the office of the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are correct, but the statements regarding specific marks, which has are not shown in the transcript is misleading, vexatious and<em> mala-fide.</em> Moreover প্রজ্ঞাপন নং শাঃ ১১/১০(১)/২০০১/ ২৬৭-শিক্ষা dated 12.03.2001 and subsequent amendment of the প্রজ্ঞাপন bearing number শিম/শাঃ ১৯/৭ পরীক্ষা-২ (গ্রেডিং)/২০০২/৬১০ dated 04.01.2003 are misleading, vexatious, <em>mala-fide</em> one. Nowhere of those two প্রজ্ঞাপন it is stated that the supply and distribution of marks-sheet are henceforth had been postponed and/ or cancelled.<br/><br/>The contention of the petitioner that no information was given by the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 by way of SMS from the website of Dhaka Education Board has been denied as it is very much stated that the Board has no authority to increase grading number and to give result by adding 0.70 marks over the existing 4.30 GPA Number are all misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the concerned statute.<br/><br/>The তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ and its ফরম ক is a statutory provision, a special law, and does not allow the petitioner to claim something that is not allowed to be disclosed or supplied in violation of the relevant statute, i.e. প্রজ্ঞাপন নং শাঃ ১১/১০(১)/২০০১/২৬৭-শিক্ষা dated 12.03.2001 and subsequent amendment of the প্রজ্ঞাপন bearing number শিম/শাঃ ১৯/৭ পরীক্ষা-২ (গ্রেডিং)/ ২০০২ /৬১০ dated 04.01.2003.<br/><br/>Mr. M. Qumrul Haque Siddique, with Mr. A.K.M. Salahuddin Khan, the learned Advocates appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner applied for re-scrutiny on 18.07.2010 on payment Taka 4 X 300= 1200.00 and the respondent Nos.1 and 2 received the money but they did not scrutinizes the matter or informed the petitioner of any action taken by them, which is a breach of the responsibility of a person performing functions of the local authority and as such the respondents are liable to be directed to discharge their obligations.<br/><br/>He further submitted that the petitioner appeared in the H.S.C. Examination on payment of Examination fees as prescribed and thereby the petitioner has acquired a right under the Rules and Regulations of the Dhaka Board to get the result of the examination in terms of the marks secured in different subjects but the respondents are most illegally depriving the petitioner from getting the marks he got in evolution of the answers scripts in different subjects.<br/><br/>He again submitted that প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003 made by the respondent No. 3 as assured against the demand of the petitioner does not by its letter or its spirit prevents the respondent No.1 and 2 from giving mark-sheet to the petitioner when the petitioner is ready and willing to bear costs.<br/><br/>Mr. Siddique, further submitted that the respondent No. 2 by letter dated 23.01.2011 advised father of the petitioner to apply in the form “N”  prescribed by তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ and thereby entered into an obligation to give mark-sheet but subsequently remained silent, and thereby the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have made it clear that they do not want to do but they are required under law to do, and as such, the respondents are liable to be directed to give mark sheets of the petitioner, since there are no legal bar.<br/><br/>He further contended that the mark sheet in question is a public record as per law; the authority is bound to issue mark sheet from public records made there from public examination like H.S.C. Examination, 2010 without any question and according to the demand of this petitioner on payment, if any is prescribed by law.<br/><br/>He referred to the observations made in University of Rajshahi, represented by the Vice Chancellor vs. Md. Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and others, that ‘the University acted against the petitioner resorting to all possible steps of delaying the matter of re- examination of the answer script in question. The totality of the matter shows wrath and biasness of the mind of the University to the writ petition.’<br/><br/>Mr. Siddique, further submitted that there is no bar in the প্রজ্ঞাপন dated 04.01.2003 (annexure- M) to supply transcript of the mark-sheet of the examination. By referring to Farah Tasnim Raisa vs. Bangladesh and others, 64 DLR 248, wherein it was observed <em>inter alia</em> that:<br/> <br/>A public and/or constitutional authority must act reasonably required to do within the ambit of the concerned law. The reasonableness and rationality can be read together in the instant case, wherein the Education Board is given the responsibility to act fairly, diligently and reasonable in applying the law. It never had the authority to override the metes and bounds of law, which it did. So a legitimate expectation cannot be defeated by a public/constitutional body, which is set by law to be followed by a public functionary.<br/> <br/>Mr. Mizanur Rahman, the learned Advocate appearing for the respondent No. 2 the Controller of Dhaka Education Board submitted that the date of result of the petitioner’s HSC examination was published on 15.07.2010, and thereafter he was issued with a academic transcript bearing Grade Points as per notification No. শাঃ ১১/১০৯১৮/ ২০০১/২৬৭-শিক্ষা dated 12.03.2001 and subsequent amendment of the notification bearing No. শিম/শাঃ ১০/৭ পরীক্ষা-২/(গ্রেডিং)/ ২০০২/ ৬১০ dated 04.01.2003. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 have no legal authority to issue marks sheet as the notification dated 12.03.2001 (ibid) does not any way either entitles the petitioner to get marks sheet or, authorises the respondents to issue marks- sheet.<br/><br/>He further submitted that the petitioner’s application dated 11.01.2011 (annexure- F) and statement in that regard in the petition is a departure from the statements made in the said application. In the application the petitioner asked for improving his GPA from 4.30 to 5.0 and also for supplying marks sheet. The board has no authority to increase grading number, as prayed by the petitioner, so his prayer was refused.<br/><br/>He again submitted that the প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) dated 04.01.2003 introducing grading system in S.S.C., H.S.C. and Alim Examinations in Bangladesh is in conformity with the provisions of the Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance (E.P. Ordinance No. XXXIII of 1961) and it is a law as per Article 152 of the Constitution. The Education Ministry representing the Government has every authority to frame law and issue প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) and the Education Board is the instrument for implementation of those প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification). The তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ has not given the petitioner such right as to obtain for him the  subject wise marks instead of Grade Point.<br/><br/>Mr. Rahman, further contended that as per notification প্রজ্ঞাপন (Notification) dated 12.03.2001 and 04.03.2003 the Board (respondent Nos.1 and 2) has no legal authority to give mark sheet to the petitioner as preamble of the notification dated 12.03.2001 provides (ibid) and as the regulation 3(2) (IV) of the Schedule to the First Regulation of the Board under the Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961 provides that the respondent No. 2 as Controller of Examination, Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka shall be responsible for ensuring and maintaining strict secrecy of all information regarding the examination of the Board, as such, a valid denial to supply marks sheet as per law cannot be termed as an act <em>ultra vires</em> to the Constitution offending a fundamental right of the petitioner.<br/><br/>He further agitated that the Board has no authority to increase grading number and to give result by adding 0.70 marks over the existing 4.30 GPA Number and therefore the present Rule obtained by the petitioner under the disguise asking for marks sheet is an unfair practice and therefore the Rule is liable to discharged.<br/><br/>On perusal of the submission of the learned Advocates of both the sides, the petition, affidavit-in-opposition and the annexed documents the crux of the issue crystallises to the point with regard to the supplying of transcript of the public examination held under the control and supervision of the Dhaka Board. Although it is pertinent to note that the Education Ministry, therefore the respondent No. 3 is time and again superseding the authority of the Education Board, Dhaka which was established under the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance (Ordinance No. 33 of 1961), 1961. The Ministry of the Education by passing such authority frequently issuing circulars and orders in total disregard to the constitutional mandate. If we look into the circular dated 04.01.2003, this circular was issued by a Senior Assistant Secretary at his own accord without mentioning under whose authority he has issued the circular direction, which is in total violation of the Constitutional provision embraced in Article 55(4) of the Constitution and apart from that Article 31 of the Constitution clearly emphasises the provision that a citizen’s right be protected in accordance with law and only in accordance with law.<br/><br/>In the instant writ petition we find that the Dhaka Education Board was established in 1961 as an independent body to control and supervises its own affairs but in total disregard to an Act of Parliament, i.e. the Ordinance No. 33 of 1961, the Education Ministry, i.e. respondent No. 3, is supervising and controlling it and issued the grading system and the circular dated 04.01.2003, which is also in total disregard to the Ordinance No. 33 of 1961, therefore the circular dated 04.01.2003 is issued without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/><br/>It is very pertinent to mention that a circular as per Article 152 of the Constitution is a law, as such, it has a force of law but the question as to the validity of the circular itself is pertinent. All the circulars with regard to shifting to grading system and so on in that regard is done in violation of the provisions of Ordinance No. 33 of 1961. However, since the Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, Dhaka has adopted the same and rendering their act would render all the acts and deeds done so far will paralyse the affairs of the Board.<br/><br/>The petitioner’s claim that result of an examinee is a public document and be supplied relates only to the examinee only, not to the others, unless authorised by law to have access to the same. The petitioner also claimed that the Dhaka Education Board ought to have supplied transcript of the petitioner’s H.S.C. result as a matter of right and under the provision of তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯z However, since the existing system of the Education Board did not allow issuance of mark sheet entailing detailed marks, it only has the provision of supplying transcript narrating Grade Points only, as such, denial of supplying mark sheet under the তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯ is quite justified. Any information which is not allowed by the basic statute, cannot be supplied or disclosed under the তথ্য অধিকার আইন, ২০০৯.<br/><br/>The contention of the respondents that the Ministry of Education has the authority to issue any circular, order etc. for the betterment and development of the overall education is not correct. The Ministry cannot override the authority of the Education Board bestowed upon it by virtue of the ordinance 33 of 1961, Article 31, clearly embraces that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">To enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being within Bangladesh, and in particular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>As such, the Ministry should keep itself within the ambit of constitutional and statutory provisions, i.e. it must not encroach upon the authority of Education Board that is specifically entrusted to them by the said statute, however, Ministry has the authority to do acts which are not engulfed within the said statute.<br/> <br/>It is sad to note that the petitioner has claimed raising of 0.70 points in his GPA, which he has calculated absolutely wrongly. The petitioner has secured GPA 4.30 and raising that to GPA 5.0 means giving him more 50 marks, is absolutely unjustified. However the paramount contention in the instant writ petition is with regard to supplying of mark sheet elaborately specifying the marks obtained by an examinee subject wise, as was done previously before introduction of the present system. There is no contention with regard to introduction of grading system but denying an examinee to know the marks he/she has obtained in S.S.C. and H.S.C. examination is opposed to his/her fundamental right, as such we find merit in the Rule.<br/> <br/>In the result, the Rule is made absolute. The Dhaka Education Board would formulated its system to supply transcript, if asked for by an examinee, of S.S.C. and H.S.C in future. And the present petitioner be supplied with his transcript, mark sheet, for his H.S.C. examination within 30(thirty) days from the date of receipt of this judgment and order, however, this order shall only have prospective effect.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

On transfer in the Court of learned Assistant Judge, Additional Court, Gazipur, the suit was renumbered as Title Suit no.152 of 2005. The petitioner herein as defendant No.1 contested the suit and filed an application on 04.01.2006 under 0rder 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejecting the plaint contending interalia that the suit is bad for hotchpotch, barred by limitation and the plaintiffs did not take any step for amendment of the plaint in light of the actual fact narrated in the written statement. Further contending that the plaintiffs have no manner of right, title and interest in the suit land; SA. and R.S. record of the suit land are not prepared in the name of plaintiffs or their predecessors and as such without challenging S. A and R. S. record and without praying for declaration of title and khas possession, instant suit for partition simplicitor is not maintainable and liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>The plaintiff-opposite party no.1 filed written objection against the application.<br/><br/>After hearing the parties and perusing the plaint, learned Senior Assistant Judge, Additional Court, Gazipur, rejected the application vide order dated 30.03.2006.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved, defendant no.1 as petitioner filed Civil Revision no.29 of 2006 in the Court of learned District Judge, Gazipur, under Section 115(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure. On transfer the Civil Revision was heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Gazipur, who after hearing the parties and perusing the record, dismissed the Civil Revision by his judgment and order dated 20.02.2007 and thereby affirmed the order passed by the learned Senior Assistant Judge.<br/><br/>Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order, the defendant no.1 as petitioner preferred this application under section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained leave and Rule and also an order of stay.<br/><br/>Mr. Abul Kalam Mainuddin, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that both the court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in not considering that instant suit for partition simplicitor without seeking declaration of title and khas possession in the suit land is not maintainable inasmuch as it is apparent on plain reading of the plaint that the plaintiffs or their predecessors have/had no manner of right, title and possession in the suit land which is also evident from S. A. and R. S. record which are not prepared in the name of plaintiffs or their predecessors. He also submits that both the court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in holding that plaint of the suit is not fall within the purview of 0rder 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and defendant-petitioner did not state in his application under what Sub-rule of 0rder 7 Rule 11 the plaint should be rejected though on plain reading of the plaint it is very much evident that the plaint is liable to be rejected under clause (d) of 0rder 7 Rule 11 i.e. barred by law. He next submits that learned Senior Assistant Judge rejected the application on the ground that the case is ready for final hearing and thereby committed an error of law inasmuch as court is competent to reject the plaint at any stage of the proceeding if it finds that condition under Order 7 Rule 11 exists. He further submits that from the averments and prayer of the plaint, ultimate result is clear as day light that the suit is not maintainable and therefore such a suit should be burried at its inception so that no further time is consumed in a fruitless litigation. In support of his submissions, learned Advocate referred to the case of  Abdul Jalil and others -Vs- Islamic Bank Bangladesh Ltd. and others, reported in 53 DLR (AD) 12; the case of Umesh Chandra Saxena and others-vs- Administrator General, U.P. Allahabad and others, reported in AIR 1999 (Allahabad)109; the case of Bangladesh Jatiya Samabaya Shilpa Samity Ltd.-Vs- Shan Hosiery, Proprietor Md. Abu Taleb and others, reported in 10 BLC(AD) 8 and the case of Rasheda Begum-Vs- M. M. Nurussafa and others, reported in 24 BLD(AD) 223.<br/><br/>No one appeared on behalf of the opposite parties.<br/><br/>At the very outset, it may be mentioned here that draft of the revisional application under Section 115(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure is not happy one inasmuch as the case of the parties are not narrated in the application, even it is not stated whether the opposite parties filed written statement or not. However, since leave granted and Rule issued, for disposal of the same I have gone through the plaint filed by the plaintiff-opposite parties. It appears from averments of the plaint that the suit land originally belonged to Dukhai Soyal. Plaintiff’s narrated genelogy of their predecessors who owned the suit land and claimed themselves as heirs of the owners of the suit land and also claimed that the suit land is not partitioned amongst the co-shaers who are in possession of the ejmali suit land. It is also stated that the plaintiffs and defendants are possessing the suit land as co-sharers and filed the suit for partition on refusal of partition of the suit land by the defendants.<br/><br/>Defendant No.1 of the suit filed application under 0rder 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure contending interalia that the suit is bad for hotchpotch, barred by limitation and the plaintiffs did not take any step for amendment of the plaint inspite of actual facts as narrated in the written statement. Further contending that the plaintiffs got their portion of the land long before and are in possession of the same and as such the suit is liable to be rejected.<br/><br/>Upon hearing the parties and perusing the plaint, learned Senior Assistant Judge rejected the application under 0rder 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure with a finding that the plaintiffs instituted the suit for partition claiming themselves as co-sharers of the suit land and filed documents in support of their claim, as such it requires evidence to determine title and possession of the plaintiffs in suit land. The learned Additional District Judge maintained order of the learned Senior Assistant Judge holding that “On perusal of the plaint of the original suit it appears that the plaint of the original suit is not fall within the purview of Sub-Rule (a),(b),(c),(d), of Rule 11 of 0rder 7. Plaintiff disclosed the cause of action; Plaint is not under valued; Plaintiff paid proper court fees and plaint is not barred by any law. Therefore the plaint of the original suit no.152 of 2005 is not liable to be rejected. The averments of the application for rejecting the plaint are a factual matter. It can not be decided at this stage of the suit.”<br/><br/>On perusal of the application under 0rder 7 Rule 11 it also appears that the defendant petitioner did not state under what Sub-rule of Rule 11 of Order 7 the plaint should be rejected.<br/>Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>11.</strong> The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases:-</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>where it does not disclose a cause of action;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Where the relief claimed is undervalued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court fails to do so;</em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so; and </em></li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.” </em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> On perusal of the plaint and application under Order 7 Rule 11 filed by the petitioner, primafacie it appears that the plaintiffs and defendants are heirs of the original owners of the suit land. Paragraph Nos. 3 and 4 from the application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code are quoted hereinunder:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৩) যেহেতু মোকদ্দমাটি পক্ষদোষ, তামাদিতে বারিতসহ মোকদ্দমার নালিশী সম্পত্তি বিষয়ে জবাবের প্রকৃত ঘটনায় মালিকানা সংত্র্রা ভুলসহ বিসরিত ভুলত্র্রটি উল্লেখ করা স্বত্তেও বাদীপক্ষ যথাযথভাবে আরজী সংশোধনসহ কোনরুপ পদক্ষেপ গ্রহণ করিতে পারে নাই এমনকি করার ইচ্ছাও প্রকাশ করে নাই, যাহার কারণে অত্র দরখাস¹ দাখিল করা হইল<br/>৪) যেহেতু বাদীপক্ষ তাহাদের প্রাপ্য অংশ বহু পূর্বেই বুঝিয়া নিয়া তাহাদের অংশে ভোগ দখলে আছে অথচ বাদীপক্ষের স্বত্ব ও দখল বিহীন অপরের সম্পত্তি নিজেদের সম্পত্তি দাবী করিয়া নালিশী সম্পত্তি হিসাবে মোকদ্দমার তপছিলভুক্ত করিয়া কোনরুপ কারণ বিহীন অত্র হয়রানীমুলক মোকদ্দমা দায়ের করিয়াছে যাহার আরজী নাকচ যোগ্য”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>No where in the application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code, it is denied that the plaintiffs are heirs of the original owners of the suit land, rather it is stated in paragraph No.4 of the application that the plaintiffs got their share long before and are in possession of the same. It also appears from the order of the learned Senior Assistant Judge that in support of their claim as co-sharers in the suit land, plaintiffs filed documents alongwith the plaint, as such both the courts below rightly held that it is matter of evidence whether the plaintiffs have title and possession in the suit land. The appellate court below correctly arrived at a finding that the statements of the application for rejecting the plaint are factual matter and cannot be decided at this stage of the suit.<br/> <br/>For the purpose of deciding an application under Clause (d) of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code, the averments in the plaint are the germane. The statement in the plaint without addition or subtraction must show that it is barred by any law to attract application of Order 7 Rule 11. This is not so in the present case.<br/><br/>I am inclined to concur with findings of the court below that the statements made in the application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not come within the purview of any of the sub-rules mentioned therein for rejecting the plaint.<br/><br/>In the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find any merit in the Rule.<br/><br/>The cases cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioner are not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged.<br/><br/>Order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated.<br/><br/>Learned Senior Assistant Judge, Additional Court, Gazipur, is directed to dispose of the Civil Suit no. 152 of 2005 expeditiously, preferably within 3(three) months from the date of receipt of this judgment.<br/> <br/>   Communicate a copy of this judgment to the Court concern at once.<br/><br/><strong>   Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

In the schedule to the plaint the mortgaged property included as schedule B. The said Artha Rin Suit was decreed on 17.1.2012. Thereafter for realization of the decretal amount the Respondent- Bank filed Artha Jari Case No. 69 of 2012. The mortgaged property was placed on auction under Section 33(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (“Ain”) fixing 08.01.2013. Three bidders participated in the auction, but the did was not accepted by the Adalat being found the price low.<br/><br/>Thereafter, the property again was placed on auction under Section 33(4) of the Ain fixing 24.02.2013. On the date fixed four bidders participated in the auction and amongst them the bid of one Md. Nasiruddin was accepted being found highest. On 18.4.2013 the Decree Holder Bank filed an application under Section 151 read with Section 153 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“Code”) for correction of the Schedule B of the property to the Execution Application, Plaint and Decree. The Court fixed 16.5.2013 for hearing of the application. On that date the Petitioner No.1 filed an application under Order XXI Rule 83 of the Code read with Section 57 of the Ain praying for selling the property by private negotiation. On the same day the auction purchaser also filed an application under Order XXI Rule 92 of the  Code for confirmation of auction sale. The Court heard both the applications and upon hearing rejected the Petitioners application and allowed the application of the auction purchaser and thereby passed Order confirming the sale. Subsequently, on 5.6.2013, application filed under Section 151 and 153 of the Code was heard and allowed by the Court and directed to correct the schedule of Execution Case and to prepare Bainanama and send it to the Registration Office for registration.  On 27.6.2013 the petitioner No.1 filed an application under OrderXXI Rule 90 of the Code for setting aside the sale which was registered as Miscellaneous Case No. 28 of 2013. The Artha Rin Adalat heard the Miscellaneous Case and rejected the same Vide Order No. 33 dated 3.7.2013.

On the       <br/>South: Land of Mr. Abdul Khalaeque Sarder.<br/>On the East: Land of Mr. Akrob Ali<br/>On the West: Read of District Board.<br/>Along with all structures and building constructed or to be constructed therein together with all rights, interests, title, easements etc. attached thereto or appurtenance to the property.  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>It is pointed out by the Petitioners that in the schedule above quoted no plot number has been mentioned. But in the auction notice published under Section 33(4) of the Ain in the daily “Inquilab” and “Bhorer Kagoj”  on 24.1.2013 description of the property given as follows:- জেলা- নারায়ণগঞ্জ, থানা- ফতুল্লা, সাব-রেজিষ্ট্রি অফিস- ফতুল্লা, ঢাকা কালেক্টরেটের অ¿¹র্ভূক্ত তৌজি নং- ১১৩২, জে, এল নং- ১৯২, মৌজা- ইসদাইর, সি, এস, খতিয়ানভূক্ত ১১২, এস, এ খতিয়ান নং- ৯৬, সি,এস ও এস, এ দাগ নং- ১২০, আর, এস দাগ নং ১৬০ এ জমির পরিমাণ- ১৪.৩৩ ডেসিমেল.<br/><br/>Asserting that the description of the property as quoted above is different from the description given in the schedule to the Plaint, Decree as well as in the Execution Application, the Petitioners submits that the Executing Court ought to have published the auction notice as per schedule contained in the Execution Application and Decree. The Petitioners now contend that the Court in violation of law published the auction notice and amended the schedule to the Execution Application on the prayer of the Decree Holder and as such the Impugned Order allowing correction of the schedule inserting Plot number is liable to be declared without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. It is further stated that the  rejection of the application  under Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code without allowing the Petitioner to adduce evidence and rejection of the application under Order XXI Rule 83 of the Code are also illegal and without lawful authority. The Decree Holder Bank is therefore submitted to have fraudulently published the auction notice, conducted auction sale and illegally amended the schedule of the Execution Application and as such the auction notice and subsequent sale of the property vitiates for the reason of illegality and fraud. At this juncture the Petitioners moved this Court against the Order of the Artha Rin Adalat by filing this application and obtained the present Rule and Order of stay.<br/><br/>The Respondent No.2, Bank Decree-Holder Bank and the Respondent No.3 auction purchaser contested the Rule by filing separate Affidavit-in-Oppositions.<br/><br/>The Respondent No.2 in its Affidavit-in-Opposition contended that the writ petition is not maintainable in its present form. The matter raised in this application is merely a technical and a procedural matter which required to be proved by adducing evidence which is not permissible under the writ jurisdiction. It is also stated that the property described in the schedule to the Plaint in suit was according to the Deed of Mortgage and Power of Attorney. Further it is stated that the property sold in auction is the property mortgaged by the mortgagor with the Bank and not the property other than the mortgaged property. Non-inclusion of plot in the Mortgage Deed and schedule to the plaint is merely an omission occurred due to inadvertence. The Khatian numbers, area of land and identification of the mortgaged property are not disputed by the Petitioners. It is also not disputed that the property sold in auction inserting plot number in the schedule of the Execution Application are the properties other than the mortgaged property. As such the Court committed no illegality in allowing the application inserting plot number in the schedule to the Execution Application. It is also stated that there was no illegality in holding auction sale by the Court below.<br/><br/>Respondent No.3, the auction purchaser contended that he is a bonafide purchaser of the property with value. He paid Tk=1,25,10,000.00 as consideration for the property and accordingly  got Sale Certificate registered and delivery of possession of the property. At this stage the present application is not at all maintainable. It is also stated that to get the auction sale set aside there is provisions in the Code which the Petitioners availed of by filing application under Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code that was rejected by the Court upon contested hearing. So, nothing left for the present Petitioners to agitate further about the validity and propriety   of the auction sale held.<br/><br/>Mr. Shah Munir Sharif, the learned Advocate appearing for the Petitioners submits that the Artha Rin Adalat committed illegality in accepting the bid of the auction purchaser by its Order No. 17 dated 24.2.2013 on the ground that the auction notice published in the daily news paper containing description of the property does not tally with the schedule of the property to the Execution Application. He further submits that the Executing Court cannot go beyond the decree. But in the instant case the Executing Court corrected the schedule of property in the Execution Application which is absent in the schedule to the Plaint as well as in the Decree. It is also argued that the application filed by the Petitioners under Order XXI Rule 90 of the Code was rejected by the Artha Rin Adalat without allowing the Petitioners to adduce evidence. As such the auction sale is illegal and without lawful authority.<br/><br/>Mr. M. Moksedul Islam, the learned Advocate appearing for the Respondent No.2 Bank submits that the Artha Rin Adalat in holding auction sale committed no illegality. The Court as per provision of law for the first time published auction notice under Section 33(1) of the Ain for sale of the property but the price quoted in the said auction found low. Consequently said bid was not accepted by the Court. Subsequently the Court below published auction notice under Section 33(4) of the Ain for the second time and in the said sale four bidders participated in the auction and amongst them Respondent No.3’s, quotation   being found highest was accepted by the Court upon compliance of the provisions of law. Regarding Order No. 17 dated 24.2.2013  Mr. Islam submits that in accepting the bid of the Respondent No.3, the Court in its Order  specifically mentioned that the  price quoted by the highest  bidder is the price more than the mouza rate of the  respective area determined by the Government. In these circumstances there was no illegality and irregularity in the auction held. He further submits that admittedly the property mortgaged with the Bank by the mortgagor-Petitioners was sold in auction and there is no dispute regarding identity, quantity and location of the mortgaged property. Mere omission to include the plot number in the schedule to the Mortgage Deed, Plaint in Suit and Execution Application  is not fatal and for such technical reason the sale cannot be termed to be illegal or vitiated by any illegality. Referring the  schedule of the property to the title deed of the mortgagors, Mr. Islam  submits that Touzi number, C.S. and S.A. Khatian and the area of land as well as the boundary of the property are same with the schedule to the Mortgage Deed, Plaint and Execution Application. The plot as contained in the title deed is plot number 120 was not included in the schedule to the Mortgage Deed through inadvertence. It is a minor irregularity and for said irregularity the process of auction sale cannot be said to be illegal or without lawful authority. It is also argued that the Court by correcting the schedule to the Execution Application and inserting a plot number has not gone beyond the decree, because of the fact that the identity of the property has not been disputed by the judgment-debtors. The said insertion of plot number was done not to cure any defect but for the purpose of registration of the sale certificate effectively with the Registration Office as required by them.<br/><br/>Mr. Harun-Or-Rashid, the learned Advocate appearing for the Respondent No.3, auction purchaser submits that after long lapse of time the Petitioners came before this Court challenging the said sale which has already been taken effect to. He also submits that  the Executing Court empowered in  law to correct any error or  omission under Sections 151 and 153 of the Code  and Section 57 of the Ain to secure ends of justice.  There was no illegality in allowing the application filed under sections 151 and 153 of the Code for correction of the schedule to the Execution Application. He also submits that the Rule was issued by this Court restraining the Respondent from taking over possession after effecting delivery of possession of the property to the auction purchaser. Therefore, the auction purchaser cannot be restrained from enjoyment of the property purchased in auction. <br/>Heard the learned Advocates for the parties, perused the Application, Affidavit-in-Oppositions and annexures annexed thereto.<br/><br/>The Petitioners in this application challenged as many as three Orders of the Artha Rin Adalat being Order No. 17 dated 24.2.2013, accepting the bid, Order No. 21 dated 16.5.2013 rejecting the Petitioners application under Order XXI Rule 83 CPC and confirming   the sale and Order No. 22 dated 5.6.2013 allowing amendment of the application of the Decree Holder under Sections 151 and 153 of the Code.<br/><br/>It appears that the argument of the Petitioners Counsel mainly centered to Order No. 22 dated 5.6.2013 by which the Artha Rin Adalat inserted plot number of the mortgaged property in the schedule to the Execution Application.  Mr. Shah Munir Sharif assailing the said Order submits that in the schedule to the Plaint and Decree no plot number was mentioned and in the Execution Application also plot number is absent. But in publishing auction notice the Court for the first time included plot number without amendment of the Plaint, Decree and the Execution Application. After confirmation of sale and before registration of the Sale Certificate the Artha Rin Adalat on an application filed by the Decree Holder under Sections 151 and 153 of the Code read with Section 57 of the Ain inserted plot number in the schedule to the Execution Application. But the Plaint and the Decree remained unamended. As such the executing Court gone beyond the decree  which  it cannot do according to law. To appreciate the submissions of the learned Counsel   for the Petitioners the schedule to the title deed of the mortgagors may be looked into which runs thus:- জিলা-ঢাকা, থানা-ফতুল্যা ও সাব রেজিষ্টারী নারায়নগঞ্জের অধিন ঢাকা কালেক্টরেটের ১১৩২ নং তৌজি ভূক্ত: সে: মে: ১৯২ নং মৌজা-ইসদাইর সিÛত: সি, এস, ১১২নং খতিয়ানের লিখিত এস, এ, ৯৬ নং খতিয়ান ভূক্ত: ১২০ একশত বিশ দাগের সাবেক নাল জমি হালে ভিটি ভূমি ১৪  (পনে পনের) শতাংশ সাফ বিত্র্রীত বটে z ইহার চৌহুদ্দী উত্তরে-মো: আজিম মিঞা দক্ষিণে-আব্দুল খালেক সরদার পূর্বে-আত্র্রব আলী পশ্চিমে-জেলা বোর্ডের রাস.<br/><br/>It appears that the above quoted schedule to the title deed of the mortgagors contains Touzi number, Khatian number, plot number, area and boundary. In the schedule to the Mortgage Deed, Power of Attorney, Plaint and Decree, the Touzi number, Khatian number, quantum of land and the boundaries are same, only plot number left out. It is true that the Petitioners did not deny the identity of the mortgaged property or claim that the property sold in auction are not the property mortgaged by the mortgagors. But only plea taken by the Petitioners is that there is no plot number in the Mortgage Deed, schedule to the Plaint and in the Decree. Subsequent insertion of Plot number by the Court upon an application of the Decree Holder is illegal and without lawful authority. It appears that the mortgaged property is covered by C.S. and S.A. plot No. 120. But the said plot was not mentioned in the Deed of Mortgage as well as in the Artha Rin Adalat proceedings.  This Court do not disagree with the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners on the point that the Executing Court cannot go beyond the decree but facts remain that the Petitioners did not deny or dispute the identity of the property and it is also not the case of the Petitioners that the Bank sold the property not mortgaged with the Bank as security by bringing an amendment in the schedule to the application.<br/><br/>The only question is whether the law is so helpless as to be unable to give effect to the decree passed by the court. The law is not helpless. This court finds that the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat construed the decree in the light of admitted fact that the property sold by auction, is, indeed, property actually mortgaged as security against loan. In this situation the Adalat in an appropriate case to ascertain the circumstances under which the decree was passed and ordered sale of the property by auction can consider the application for correction of the schedule maintaining true intent and purpose of the decree.<br/> <br/>In the case of Bhavan Vaja and others-Vs- Solauki Hanuji Khodaji Mansong and another, reported in AIR (1972) SC 1371 it has been held that;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“It is true that an executing court cannot go behind the decree under execution. But that does not mean that it has no duty to find out the true effect of that decree. For construing a decree it can and in appropriate cases it ought to take into consideration the pleadings as well as the proceedings leading upto the decree. In order to find out the meaning of the words employed in a decree, the court often has to ascertain the circumstances under which these words came to be used. That is the plain duty of the executing court and if that court fails to discharge that duty it would be deemed to have failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The underlying rationale for such revisitation of the decree by an executing Court was endorsed in Hemanta Kumar Ghosh Vs. Rajendra Mondal Case reported in 39 CWN, 1295, the Revision Court found jurisdiction to so amend a decree should it not correctly represent what was decided or intended to be decided. The only qualification to such amending authority is that it ought not to result in any injustice. Indeed, the Court in the Hemanta Kumar Ghosh Case referred to an earlier decision in Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd.-Vs-Abdul Jalil Mia, reported in 37 CWN 500 (1933) which, subscribing to the ratio in <em>Hatton -Vs- Harris </em>reported in 1892 A.C. 547, held that :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The Court has power to amend a decree in order to bring it into conformity with the judgment at any time even after the decree has been partly executed-the only limitation being that the Court may deem it inexpedient or inequitable to exercise its powers when third parties have acquired rights under the erroneous decree without a knowledge of the circumstances which would tend to show that the decree was erroneous.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Indeed was also held in the Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd. Case that:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Although an executing Court cannot go behind the decree where the executing Court and the Court which passed the decree are one and the same, the Court can amend the decree in the course of execution.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>This Court finds that the property in question covered by Touzi No. 192,  C.S. Khatian No. 112 , S.A. Khatian No. 96 butted and bounded  by definite boundary as  admitted by the parties to the litigation . In such a situation it was not necessary for the Decree Holder Bank to amend the schedule inserting plot number wherein specific boundary, Khatian number and quantum of land are same as in the title deed of the mortgagors. It is in this Court’s view that inclusion of plot number in the Execution Application was a mere surplusage, not calculated to mislead anybody. In the case of Shafiuddin Kazi  alias Safiruddin Vs. Moslem Ali Howlader and others reported in 12 D.L.R. (1960), 266. It was held that<em>, “boundaries as well as area both are mentioned in the document. In case of difference between the two, boundaries to prevail.”</em> In the case of Darap Ali Sadagar Vs. Najir Ahamed reported in 50 I.L.R. (1923) (Cal) 394 it was  held that;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“As soon as there is an adequate and sufficient definition, with convenient certainty, of what is intended to pass by a deed, any subsequent erroneous addition will not vitiate it.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the light of the observations made in the above quoted decisions we are of the view that insertion of Plot number was not at all necessary where specific boundary of the Mortgaged property given and the Executing Court committed no illegality by inserting Plot number in the schedule considering and construing the facts that the property sold by auction are the property Mortgaged to the Decree  Holder Bank.<br/> <br/>In other words, this amendment contributes nothing to this Court’s understanding of the subject matter in dispute. The correction as made in the application by inserting plot number in the schedule without inserting the same in the schedule to the Plaint and the Decree though it was prayed for by the Decree Holder, it could at best be treated as erroneous in law and consequently not liable to be reviewed by this Court in Writ Jurisdiction, where such inclusion of the plot has contributed nothing to the detriment of the present petitioners and caused any injustice to them. Moreover, the petitioners raised this technical question at a belated stage after delivery of possession of the property to the auction purchaser. It is also to be mentioned that the petitioners filed various applications to  forestall the execution process but failed. By filing this application also tried to achieve a goal indirectly on a technical point.<br/> <br/>Section 65 and Rules 82 to 103 of Order 21 of the Code deal with the auction sale of immovable property in an execution proceeding. To get the sale set aside the judgment debtor has two options under Rules 89 and 90 of Order 21 of the Code. Rule 89 gives a right to have the sale set aside on deposit of bid money with 5% interest thereon within 30 days of the sale held. Rule 90 of Order 21 on the other hand gives a right to file an application seeking set aside sale on the ground of irregularity or fraud in the process of auction sale. Rule 92(1) provides that where no application is made under Rules 89,90 or 91 and where such application is made and disallowed, the court shall make an order confirming the sale and thereupon the sale shall become absolute and the court shall grant a certificate specifying the property sold and the name of the person who at the time of sale was declared to be purchaser under Rule 94 and the immovable property sold in execution of a decree shall become absolute as per Section 65 of the Code and the property shall be deemed to have vested in the purchaser  from the time when it is sold and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute or the date of confirmation of  sale. In this instant case the petitioner exhausted the provision of Rule 90 of Order 21 of the Code. Subscribing  to the <em>ratio decidendi</em> in Pethaperumal -Vs- Chidambaram reported in AIR 1954 Mad. 760 this court holds that certain substantive consequences follow  on the issuance  of a sale certificate in law taking the form of (a) the purchaser’s title to the property becoming perfected and (b) his right to possession becoming unimpeachable. It is, therefore, held by this court resultantly that nothing detracts from any of these rights above enumerated at any point of time after the issuance of a sale certificate and delivery of possession. Armed with such a perfected title and an unimpeachable right to possess, it, therefore,   stands to reason, that no challenge to the auction sale or, in particular, the rights of the auction purchaser Respondent No.3 can be mounted with any hope of success as otherwise purported to have been done repeatedly at the behest of the judgment debtor petitioners by appealing to the various provisions of the Code and the Act.<br/> <br/>There is no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure which provides for the derailment of certain substantive consequences that necessarily ensue upon a confirmation of sale and invariably so in favour of an auction purchaser. It does not seem ever to have been doubted that once the sale is confirmed the judgment debtor is not entitled to get back the property even if he succeeds thereafter in having the decree against him reversed. As thus observed in the case of Janak Raj -Vs.- Gurdial Singh and another reported in AIR (1967)  SC 608 . Given, therefore, that once the auction is complete no relief is available against such auction sale but the mortgagor may proceed against the mortgagee bank for compensation if it is proved that there was illegality in the auction sale as observed by our apex court in the case of Sonali Bank, Shilpa Bhaban Corporate Branch, Dhaka Vs. Artha Rin Adalat, Narayanganj and others reported in 15 MLR (AD) 20, wherein it was held that;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“In view of the provision of law to the effect that once an auction sale is complete no relief is available against such auction sale but the mortgagor may proceed against the mortgagee bank for any compensation, if it is proved that there was illegality in the auction sale.”</em></div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Finally, the petitioners Counsel raised a point of  territorial jurisdiction of the  Court as the property situated in the District Narayangonj though in the instant application said question was not  raised and the Rule was not issued on that point. However, this Court examined the submissions made by the petitioners Counsel and the point raised. It appears that the matter involved in this case is not a matter in between the decree holder and the judgment debtor. Here the matter is involved with a third party i.e. the auction purchaser who acquired a legal right as auction purchaser for valuable consideration. Had it been a case in between the Decree-Holder and Judgment Debtor and a case of acquiring right of possession and enjoyment of the property by the Bank Decree Holder under Section 33(5) of the Ain or acquiring a certificate of title under Section 33(7) of the Ain, the situation would have been otherwise as observed in the case of Prem Chand Day-Vs-Mokhoda Desi reported in 17 ILR (1890) 699 referred by the petitioners counsel in support of his submission. This Court is of the view that if the claim of the judgment debtors is entertained at this stage it will tantamount to declare the title of the auction purchaser nugatory, thereby, extending and giving an unwarranted benevolence to the petitioners.<br/><br/>However, if the petitioners as judgment debtors feel aggrieved by the sale of the property in an unusual manner or irregularly, they can claim compensation against the Decree Holder Bank by filing a properly constituted suit for compensation if so advised.<br/> <br/>In the facts and circumstances and observations made hereinabove we do not find any merit in this Application and the Rule Nisi issued calling for interference by this Court.<br/><br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged, however, without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>The order of restrain granted at the time of issuance of the Rule is hereby recalled and stand vacated.<br/><br/>Communicate a copy of this Judgment and Order to the Court concerned at once.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Nazrul Islam Talukder, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>This Rule, at the instance of the accused-petitioners, was issued on an application under section 561A  of  the Code of Criminal Procedure calling upon the opposite-party to show cause as to why proceeding of G.R. Case No.163 of 2007 arising out of Hajaribagh Police Station Case No. 11 dated 13.9.2007 under sections 420/406/468/471/109 of the Penal Code, now pending in the Court of learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Dhaka should not be quashed and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.<br/> <br/>Facts relevant for the purpose of disposal of this Rule may be, briefly, stated as follows:<br/>        On 1.7.2007, one Md. Ain Uddin as complainant filed a petition of complaint before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka against the accused-petitioners and others alleging, inter-alia, that the father and uncle of the complainant were the original owners of 1.24 acres of land by way of purchase by a registered deed of sale and their names were recorded in S.A, R.S and Mahanagar Survey jointly. They also got their shares separated by way of mutation in respect of the said property. Subsequently, Water Development Board acquired .88 acre of land out of 1.24 acres of land. Accordingly, the father and uncle of the complainant remained the owners of the remaining .36 acre of land in equal share. The uncle of the complainant sold out .18 acre of land to different persons. The father of the complainant, thereafter, became owner of .18 acre of land and got his share separated in his name by Mutation Case No. 143 of 2002 in respect of .18 acre of land through the office of Assistant Commissioner (Land), Dhanmondi Circle, Dhaka. The father of the complainant, who allowed accused Nos. 1-3, 7 and 8 to run their business as a garage in one part of the said land, died later on 25.5.2004 leaving behind a wife, 6 sons and 2 daughters. Taking advantage of the death of the father of the complainant, accused-petitioner Nos. 1 to 3, in connivance with other accused, created a forged deed of sale dated 28.2.2002 in order to grab the land property of the complainant and other co-sharers. Subsequently, accused-petitioner Nos. 1 to 3 filed an application before the Assistant Commissioner (Land), Dhanmondi Circle, Dhaka for opening separate Mutation khatian in their names. The complainant then came to know about the aforesaid forged deed of sale. Subsequently, the complainant collected a copy of the deed of sale No. 832 from the office of District Registrar and came to know about a forged deed by which the accused-petitioners wanted to grab the property of the complainant and his co-sharers. The accused-petitioners, by doing the aforesaid act, committed offence of forgery in order to grab the property of the complainant and his co-sharers. Hence this First Information Report was lodged against the accused-petitioners under sections 420/406/467/ 471/108 of the Penal Code on 13.9.2007.<br/> <br/>On receiving the petition of complaint, the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka directed the police of Hajaribag Police Station to record the aforesaid petition of complaint as First Information Report and accordingly, the same was registered as Hajaribag police Station Case No. 11 dated 13.09.2007 under sections 420/406/467/468/ 471/109 of the Penal Code against the accused-petitioner and others.<br/> <br/>During investigation, the police went to the place of occurrence and recorded the statements of the witnesses   under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Having found <em>prima facie</em> case, the police submitted charge sheet No.129 dated 01.08.2008 under sections 420/406/467/468/471/109 of the Penal Code against the accused-petitioner and others.<br/> <br/>At the commencement of the trial on 09.04.2009, the learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka framed charge against the accused-petitioners under sections 420/406/467/468/471/109 of the Penal Code and the same was read over to the accused-petitioners who denied the charge and claimed to be innocent and prayed to face trial in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>It is to be noted here that on 08.4.2007, accused-petitioner Nos. 1-3 as the plaintiffs filed Title Suit No. 167 of 2007 before the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of learned Assistant Judge, Dhaka against one Abdul Baten and others for permanent injunction and the same is awaiting disposal.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned proceeding, the accused-petitioners approached this Court with this application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and obtained this Rule.<br/> <br/>At the very  outset, Mr. Syed Mahmudul Ahsan, learned Advocate  appearing on  behalf  of  the  accused-petitioners, submits that learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Dhaka took cognizance of the offence and framed charge against the accused-petitioners in violation of section 195(1)(C) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such, the impugned proceeding is liable to be quashed. He next submits that a civil suit is pending over a self-same matter and as such, the impugned proceeding is an abuse of the process of the court. He also submits that the allegations brought against the petitioners are of civil in nature and as such the criminal proceeding filed against the petitioner is abuse of the process of the Court. He further submits that in the First Information Report, there are no ingredients of sections 420/406/468/471/109 of the Penal Code against the accused-petitioners. He then submits that the instant criminal proceeding is so preposterous that no case stands against the petitioners and that the same has been filed only to harass and humiliate the petitioners. He lastly submits that the First Information Report does not disclose any criminal offence and as such, the initiation and continuation of the impugned proceedings against the accused-petitioners is an abuse of the process of the court and as such, the impugned proceeding is liable to be quashed. <br/> <br/>On the other hand, Mr. Kazi M. Ejarul Haque, learned Deputy Attorney-General along with Mr. Md. Shafquat Hussain, Assistant Attorney-General appearing for the State, submits that there are sufficient ingredients of the offences punishable under sections 420/406/468/471/109 of the Penal Code against the accused-petitioners. He next submits that the allegations brought against the accused-petitioners were found to be true during the investigation. He further submits that the allegations brought against the accused-petitioners are the factual matters which are required to be proved by evidence. He then submits that since charge has been framed against the petitioners and the witnesses, in the meantime, are to be examined, there is no ground to quash the proceeding at this stage. He lastly submits that there is no bar to filling of a criminal case inspite of the fact that a civil suit is pending over a self-same matter and as such, the Rule, in view of the above facts and circumstances of the case, should be discharged.<br/> <br/>We have gone through the application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the materials annexed thereto. <br/> <br/>Now, the question arises whether the impugned proceeding should be quashed or not. To decide this issue, it will be necessary to see the extent of power and scope in which High Court Division may invoke its power and authority under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.<br/> <br/><em>In the case of <strong>Abdul Quader Chowdhury Vs. The State, 28 DLR (AD) (1976) 38</strong>, it has been spelt out that to bring a case within the purview of section 561 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the purpose of quashing a proceeding one of the following conditions must be fulfilled:</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Interference even at an initial stage may be justified where the facts are so preposterous that even on admitted facts no case stands against the accused.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Where the institution and continuation of the proceeding amounts to an abuse of the process of the court.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Where there is a legal bar against the initiation or continuation of the proceeding.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In a case where the allegations in the F.I.R or the petition of complaint, even if taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the offence as alleged. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>The allegations against the accused although constitute an offence alleged but there is either no legal evidence adduced in support of the case or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> Similar view, on the principles and categories of cases for quashing the proceedings, was, subsequently, followed in the decision in the case of <strong>Ali Akkas Vs. Enayet Hossain and others, 17 BLD (AD) (1997) 44.</strong><br/> <br/>It is a settled principle of law that if the First Information Report or the petition of complaint discloses prima facie allegations against the accused, those allegations are the matters of facts which are required to be decided by the Trial Court on taking evidence. The aforesaid legal view finds support in the case of <strong>Mr. Moudud Ahmed Vs. The State, 16 BLD (AD)(1996) 27 </strong>wherein it has been held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“In exercising power under section 561A, the High Court Division is only to see if there are <em>prima-facie</em> allegations disclosing criminal offences. The admissibility, relevance, propriety or sufficiency of materials collected by the prosecution are matters for the trial court to decide on taking evidence as all these fall outside the ambit of section 242 and 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On a plain reading of the First Information Report, it appears that the present accused-petitioners, in connivance with the other accused, created and manufactured a deed of sale by forging signature of the father of the complainant. The First Information Report further discloses that in the alleged forged deed of sale, the father of the complainant was shown as a seller and accused-petitioner Nos.1-3 were shown as buyers but, in fact, the father of the complainant never sold out any land to accused-petitioner Nos.1 to 3. The aforesaid factual matters can only be decided by the learned Judge of the trial court on taking evidence. In this connection, we may refer to a decision in the case of <strong>Dr. M. Faruq Vs. The State and another, 16 BLD (AD)(1996) 51</strong> wherein it has been decided:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“In the face of clear allegations of conspiracy, forgery and abetment against the accused persons, collectively and individually, there is no scope to quash the proceedings against them under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The material question whether the accused-petitioners are bonafide purchasers for value or not, can be decided by the trial Court only on taking evidence and it cannot be made a ground for quashing the proceeding.<br/> <br/>Now we turn to another ground that has been stated in the application under section 561A that since the accused-petitioners have got a registered deed of sale executed and registered by the father of the complainant, that deed of sale cannot be said to be a forged one unless the same is set aside by a competent civil Court. It is also a settled principle of law that a criminal case can be filed for criminal liability and a civil suit may for civil liability. Both the criminal case and civil suit can run at the same time. In this connection, we may refer to a decision in the case of  <strong>Khandaker Abul Bashar Vs State and another, 63 DLR (AD) (2011) 79</strong> wherein it has been spelt out  :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“There is no legal impediment to file a criminal case even if a civil suit is pending on the self-same allegations provided the ingredients of the offence are present.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the instant case, it appears from the record of the case that accused-petitioner Nos.1 to 3 as the plaintiffs filed civil suit No.167 of 2007 before the learned Assistant Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka against the informant and others for permanent injunction. On a bare reading of the First Information Report, we find that there is a <em>prima facie </em>allegation of forgery against the accused-petitioners who allegedly manufactured the deed of sale by forging the signature of the father of the complainant. So, we find that there are <em>prima facie</em> ingredients of forgery in the instant case. It is very much evident from the above mentioned decision that there is no legal bar to filing of a criminal case for the criminal liability and a civil suit for the civil liability. If, for the sake of argument, we hold that a civil suit has been filed challenging the legality and genuineness of the deed, even then there is no bar to proceeding with the criminal case if the First Information Report or the petition of complaint discloses <em>prima-facie </em>allegations having ingredients of the offence of forgery against the accused-petitioners.<br/> <br/>On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and the decisions discussed above, we are of the view that the First Information Report and other prosecution materials <em>prima-facie</em> disclose the offence against the accused-petitioners punishable under sections 467/ 468/474/109 of the Penal Code and in that view of the matter, there is no legal impediment to proceed with the case in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>Having considered all aspects of the case, we do not find any merit in this Rule.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the Rule is discharged.<br/> <br/>The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule is, hereby, recalled and vacated.<br/> <br/>The learned Judge of the trial court is directed to proceed with the case in accordance with law.<br/> <br/>Communicate this Judgement to the Trial Court forthwith.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Section 4(7) of the Ain provides that if a Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat has temporarily been unable to perform his duty owing to leave, illness or any other reason then the District Judge may appoint a Joint District Judge under his jurisdiction and control to perform the functions and duties of a Judge of Artha Rin Adalat for the time being on full time basis or in addition to his own duties. . . . (12)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adatal Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 6(5) and 26</strong><br/><strong>Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Order I, Rule 10</strong><br/><strong>Section 26 provides that as regards execution</strong><strong> of decree passed under this Ain the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are applicable if these are not in conflict with the provisions of the Ain. In the instant case, the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code are not in conflict with those of the Ain, 2003 inasmuch as the former is very much  in conformity with the provisions of section 6(5) of the Ain and as such the former is applicable in the instant suit. . . . (12)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adatal Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4 and 4(7)</strong><br/><strong>From the scheme of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 and the provisions of Section 4 of the Ain it is clear that the only persons legally competent to be appointed to act as Judges of the Artha Rin Adalat are Joint District Judges.   In view of Section 4 (7) of the Ain even those who are performing the functions of Judges–in-Charge of the Artha Rin Adalat shall have to be appointed from </strong><strong>amongst the Joint District Judges. Therefore,</strong><strong> the High Court Division rightly set aside those orders which were passed by the learned Judge-in-Charge who was holding the rank of Additional District Judge but part of the impugned Order No. 1 dated 23.01.2008 relating to the registration of the suit was kept valid as that was an admini-</strong><strong>strative order. The learned Additional District</strong><strong> Judge has no jurisdiction to pass any judicial order in Artha Rin Suit in view of the provisions of Section 4 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. . . . (13)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adatal Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 4(4)(7)</strong><br/><strong>The learned Additional District Judge cannot be a Judge of Artha Rin Adalat as per provisions of Sub-Sections (4) and (7) of Section 4 of the said Ain, 2003. In view of the above observations and findings we are of the view that the impugned order of attachment before judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge acting as a Judge of Artha Rin Adalat without having any power and jurisdiction being Coram non judice has been passed without lawful authority and  jurisdiction. . . . (13)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Order I, Rule 10</strong><br/><strong>Who is a necessary party and a proper party and distinction between them—The established principle of law is that either a necessary party or a proper party may be added in the suit. A necessary party is one in whose absence no effective decree can be passed. Whereas a proper party is one whose presence is not necessary for passing an effective decree. The presence of proper party facilities more effectual and complete adjudication of all the disputes and avoid multiplicity of proceeding between the parties. A proper party is one who is legally interested in the suit. A legally interested party is one whose rights has been adversely affected by any order of a court.  It appears that order No.1 dated 23.01.2008 and order No. 13 dated 6.4.2008 of the Artha Rin Suit were passed for attachment of the property in question before judgment  and order No. 33 dated 11-09-2008 and  order No. 36 dated 18-09-2009 were passed restraining the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2012 by an order of temporary injunction from carrying on with any construction work on the property in question which have adversely affected the rights of the appellant as a developer. In that view of the  matters the appellant- developer being a proper party is entitled to be added as a party to the said Suit and as such Order No. 49 dated 19.1.2009 is illegal and without lawful authority for  not allowing it to be added as a party in the suit. . . . (14)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908)</strong><br/><strong>Order I, Rule 10</strong><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adatal Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Section 6(5)</strong><br/><strong>The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute upon setting aside the order No., 49 dated 19.05.2009 committed illegality by not allowing the appellant-developer to be added as a party in the suit under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure inasmuch as Section 6(5) of the Ain which provides guidelines as to how the defendants can be impleaded in the proceedings of Artha Rin Suit is in conformity with the provisions of the aforesaid Order. In that view of the matter the appellant-developer is entitled to be added as a party in the suit in the category of defendant. Therefore we find merit in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011....

Muzammel Hossain, CJ</strong>:<br/><br/>These appeals by leave are directed against the judgment and order dated 19.01.11 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition no. 1376 of 2009 making the Rule absolute and thereby setting aside Part of Order No. 1  dated 23-01-2008 except the registration  of the Title Suit No. 7 of 2008, Order Nos. 13 dated 06-04-2008 and 49 dated 19-01-2009  passed by the Artha Rin Adalat, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong in Artha  Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008.<br/><br/>The facts for disposal of these appeals, in short, are that the respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal No. 175 of 2011 and the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 as petitioner, filed Writ Petition No. 1376 of 2009 before the High Court Division challenging the above mentioned three orders passed by the Artha Rin Adalat in Artha Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008 on the ground that they were passed without lawful authority and jurisdiction. The writ petitioner being a private limited company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1994 deals with the business of property development. The Writ petitioner company proposed to develop the land at plot No. 8, Road No. 104, Gulshan Model Town, Dhaka by constructing multistoried building thereon. The land belonged to Writ respondent No. 4, Mohammad Yahya, who got the same from RAJUK in 1996 vide a deed of lease agreement dated 22.07.1996 for 99 years. The Writ respondent No. 4 informed the writ petitioner that the title deed of his land had been deposited with the Trust Bank, Gulshan Corporate Branch, Dhaka as equitable mortgage to secure credit facilities. By executing tripartite agreement between the Writ Petitioner, Writ respondent No. 4, Mohammad Yahya and the Trust Bank, the sale price of the land had been settled. As per such agreement the writ petitioner made payment of Tk. 6,00,000,00 (six crores) to the Trust Bank to make the land owner free from liability. The Writ petitioner also paid Tk. 14,00,000,00 (fourteen lacs) to the land owner. On receipt of the said amount the Trust Bank handed over the title deed of the land to the Writ petitioner. Subsequently, the land owner executed a General power of Attorney on 25.09.2007 in favour of the Writ petitioner in order to facilitate  the construction work of multistoried building over the said land and also for exercising  his right relating to that land. The Writ respondent No.3 appellant, One Bank Limited, on 23.01.2008, as plaintiff, filed Artha Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008 before the Artha Rin Adalat, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong against the Writ  respondent No. 4, Mohammad Yahya, claiming Tk. 9,00,000.00 (nine crores). On the same date the plaintiff- One Bank Limited, filed an application under Order, XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure for attachment before Judgment. On that application show cause notices were issued upon the defendants, and pending hearing, by an ad-interim order passed on the same date (order No. 1 dated 23.01.2008) the said land had been attached. In January, 2009 the Writ petitioner filed an application under Order 1, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure for addition of party in the Artha Rin Suit which was rejected by the Court vide Order No. 49 dated 19.01.2009 on the ground that the petitioner had no locus standi under section 6(5) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003.  The Writ petitioner Chaya Developer (Pvt.) Limited challenging the authority of the concerned Judge (respondent No.2) in passing the said orders filed the Writ petition and obtained the Rule. To oppose the Rule, the Writ respondent No. 3, One Bank Limited, filed  Affidavit-In-Opposition stating, inter-alia, that the petitioner has got no locus standi to file the Writ petition since the petitioner is no more the Attorney of the land owner as well as not yet acquired any title over the land.<br/> <br/>A Division Bench of the High Court Division after hearing both the parties by the Judgment and Order dated 19.0.2011 made the Rule absolute upon  setting aside the part of Order No. 1 dated  23.01.2008 except the registration of the suit, order No. 13 dated 06.04.2008 and Order No. 49 dated 19.01.2009 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Chittagong in Artha Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008 and further holding the view that part of Order No. 1 dated 23.01.2008 relating  to registration of the suit can remain valid as that was an administrative order.<br/> <br/>Being aggrieved by the impugned Judgment and Order passed by the High Court Division, the Writ respondent No. 3 preferred Civil Appeal No. 175 of 2011 and Writ petitioner preferred Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 by leave before this  Division.<br/> <br/>In respect of Civil Appeal No. 175 of 2011 leave was granted to consider the following grounds:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the High Court Division was in error in nullifying the proceeding conducted by the Additional District Judge, inasmuch as the law does not say that trial by an Additional District Judge who was entrusted with the trial of Artha Rin Suit would be invalid because of this lacuna;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the writ petition itself suffers from incurable defect, inasmuch as the writ petitioner impugned order Nos. 1, 13 and 49 passed by the Artha Rin Adalat, although at no point of time he was a party to the suit. After his application to be added as a party was rejected by order No. 49 he filed the writ petition and took the liberty of impugning all three orders, although the first two orders impugned were passed before the writ petitioner came into the scene; and whether the High Court Division erred in entertaining the writ petition inasmuch as the writ petitioner had no locus standi to file the same;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the High Court Division erred in setting aside Order No. 49 dated 19-01-2009 passed by the Joint District Judge, Artha Rin Adalat, as suffering from lack of jurisdiction;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the High Court Division acted illegally in setting aside the orders passed by the Artha Rin Adalat,  inasmuch as any bank, in order to recover a loan, would file an Artha Rin Suit, in the Artha Rin Adalat and the suit filed by a bank in the Artha Rin Adalat for recovery of loan does not impute any knowledge upon the bank as to whether the Artha Rin Adalat suffers from lack of jurisdiction.”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> In respect of Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 leave was granted to consider the following grounds:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the High Court Division committed illegality by not allowing the petitioner to be added as defendant under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the provision not being in conflict with provisions of Section 6(5) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the High Court Division and the Artha Rin Adalat committed illegality by not considering the  provision of section 6(5) of the Ain which is an enabling provision providing guidelines as to how the defendants can be impleaded in the proceedings of an Artha Rin Suit and there is no limitation regarding who may or may not be made parties in the Artha Rin proceedings; and whether the order of the High Court Division declaring order No. 49 dated 19-01-2009 to be illegal without directing the petitioner to be added in the category of defendant in the suit should be interfered by this Division;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the petitioner is entitled to be added as party in the suit in the  category of defendant since it acquired right, title, interest and possession by constructing a multi-storied building on the disputed land by operation of law by way of redemption of equitable mortgage in respect of debt of the respondent No. 4  with Trust Bank Limited by making payment to release the land owner from the bank’s liability long before filing of the suit and the order of attachment before judgment passed on 23-01-2008.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Kamal-Ul- Alam, the learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the appellant in the Civil Appeal No. 175 of 2011 submits that the High Court Division erred in law in nullifying the proceedings conducted by the learned Additional District Judge, inasmuch as the law does not say that trial by the learned Additional District Judge who was entrusted with the trial of Artha Rin Suit would be invalid because of this lacuna. Moreover, one of three impugned orders, namely, the Order No. 49 dated 19.o1.2009 was passed by the learned Joint District Judge acting as Judge, Artha Rin Adalat and therefore, his order does not suffer from lack of jurisdiction, and yet the High Court Division declared his order as corum non-judice. He further submits that the Writ petitioner had no locus standi to file the Writ petition challenging Order Nos. 1 and 13 when he was not a party to the suit. Finally, he submits that a bank’s only option for recovery of loan money is to move the Artha Rin Adalat, as provided by Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 but a bank ought not to be expected to be aware of whether an Artha Rin Adalat suffers from lack of jurisdiction and therefore, a bank should not be made to suffer because of any alleged lack of jurisdiction of the concerned Judge.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 175 of 2011 submit that under the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 the District Judge has neither any authority to appoint the Judge for Artha Rin Adalat nor any Judge either below or above the rank of Joint District Judge can ever be entitled to be appointed as a Judge of the said Court and that it is only the Government in consultation with the Supreme Court can appoint the Judge for the said Court from those Judges belonging to the rank of Joint District Judge. Mr. Islam contends that in absence of any Judge in the Artha Rin Adalat the District Judge may appoint a substitute Judge only from the rank of Joint District Judge to act as the presiding Judge in the said Adalat and that in the instant case the learned District Judge of Chittagong knew his limitation to this effect under law and thereby he appointed the said erstwhile Additional District Judge for the administrative work only of the said court and certainly not for performing any judicial function thereon, but in excess of that jurisdiction the said Judge entertained the suit and performed several judicial functions thereon including passing the Order Nos. 1-13 (23.01.2008-6.04.2008) and that subsequently though the matter was tried by the competent Judge of competent Court but as the matter suffers lack of jurisdiction (corum-non judice) since its inception hence the later proceedings are also nonest in law. Then he submits that the writ petitioner company has obtained the land for development and transfer in due course and thereafter, the same was transferred in the name of the Chairperson of the Company vide registered Sale Deed No. 8401 dated 27.10.2008 and the same was duly mutated in her name and the company has invested huge amount of money to construct a multi-storied building thereon and that the land was neither given mortgage nor committed to give mortgage against any loan as demanded by the bank. He finally submits that the impugned order of attachment before judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge being Judge-In-Charge of the Artha Rin Adalat is illegal and without lawful authority and the appellant’s submissions in respect of the said attachment order before judgment is incorrect and misconceived and as such the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>Mr. Mahmudul Islam, the learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 submits that the High Court Division committed illegality by not allowing the Writ petitioner to be added as a party in the Artha Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008 under Order No. 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure  which is not in conflict with the  provisions of Section 6(5) of Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 inasmuch as Section 6(1) of the said Ain  provides that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908  is made applicable to the Artha Rin proceedings if it is not in conflict with the provisions of the said Ain.   He then submits that the High Court Division  and the Artha Rin Adalat committed illegality without considering the provisions of Section 6(5) of the Ain which is an enabling provision providing guidelines as to how the defendants can be impleaded in the proceedings of an Artha Rin Suit and as such the Order No. 49 dated 19.01.2009  which was declared illegal by the High Court Division without passing any order as to the addition of party of the petitioner in the category of defendant in the said suit should be interfered with by this Division . He further submits that the principle of law is that either a necessary or a proper party may be added in a suit and that a proper party is one who is legally interested in the suit. He finally submits that the Order No. 1 dated 23.02.2008 and Order No. 13 dated 06.04.2008 of the Artha Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008 for attachment of the property of the appellant and the Order No. 33 dated 11.09.2008 read with Order No. 36 dated 18.09.2009 restraining the appellant from carrying on with any construction work have adversely affected  the rights of the appellant as a developer and in that view of the matter the Order No. 49 dated 19.01.2009 is illegal and without lawful authority and the appellant is entitled to be added as a proper party to the suit.<br/><br/>Mr. Kamal-Ul-Alam, the learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the respondent No. 3 in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 submits that there is no illegality in the impugned judgment and order dated 19.01.2011 passed by the High Court Division and as such no interference is called for by this court. He then submits that the Artha Rin Adalat Ain is a special law which takes priority over ordinary law, and section 6(5) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain clearly lays down that only three kinds of persons may be the defendants in an Artha Rin Suit, namely, principal debtor, third party mortgagor and third party guarantor but the appellant, not belonging to any of these three categories, cannot be added as a defendant. He finally submits that Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure lays down the general rule when a person may be added as a party; but for the purpose of recovery of loan liabilities by the financial institutions Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 was enacted which is a special law and which makes special provisions regarding parties in an Artha Rin suit: section 6(5) is unambiguous in its description of parties, and hence section 6(5) will prevail over Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil procedure which has no manner of application in an Artha Rin Suit and as such the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned Senior Advocates for both the parties and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High court Division, concise statements submitted on behalf of all the parties and also other materials available on record.<br/><br/>It appears that while deciding the case the High Court Division found that the impugned orders were passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Chittagong and by a portion of the Order No. 1 the suit was registered as an Artha Rin Suit and by another portion of the said order (an ad-interim order) the land in question was attached till hearing of the matter by the learned Additional District Judge who presided over the Sessions of the Artha Rin Adalat. The portion of the said order attaching the land was passed as the Judge-In-Charge of the Artha Rin Adalat which is not an administrative order rather it is a judicial order. Such judicial order cannot be passed by a Judge without having any lawful authority. The Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 is a special law providing for special measures to realize loans given by financial institutions. The preamble of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 declares that the Ain, 2003 has been enacted with a view to further consolidate and amend the existing law (Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 1990) for speedy recovery of loan of the financial institutions.  Section 4 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 provides for the establishment of Artha Rin Adalats.  Therefore, it is pertinent to discuss the relevant provisions of Section 4. Under section 4(3) of the Ain, where no Artha Rin Adalat has been established as such any suit for the recovery of dues owed to financial institutions has to be filed with the concerned Court of the Joint District Judge having territorial jurisdiction and it will be  deemed that the Court of the Joint District  Judge has been in fact established/declared as an Artha Rin Adalat under the provisions of  the Ain, 2003. Section 4(4) of the Ain provides that  for implementation of the objective of this section the Government shall by Notification  in the Official Gazette  declare a Court of  Joint District Judge  as the  Artha Rin Adalat  and after such declaration  the functions of the  said  Court of Joint District Judge would be closed or stayed and the learned District Judge shall by an order transfer all pending cases from this Court to any other Court of  Joint District Judge  under his jurisdiction.  Regarding the appointment of Judges of the Artha Rin Adalat, Section 4(5) of the Ain envisages that the Government shall in consultation with the Supreme Court, appoint   Judges of the Artha Rin Adalats from amongst the Joint District Judges and the Joint District Judges appointed in the aforesaid manner shall not be able to adjudicate any other civil or criminal cases except the Artha Rin Suit. Section 4(7) of the Ain provides that if a Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat has temporarily been unable to perform his duty owing to leave, illness or any other reason then the District Judge may appoint a Joint District Judge under his jurisdiction and control to perform the functions and duties of a Judge of Artha Rin Adalat for the time being on full time basis or in addition to his own duties. Section 5 (1) of the Ain contemplates that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law and subject to the provisions of Sub-Sections (5) and (6), a financial institution may institute a suit in connection with the realization of loan in the Artha Rin Adalat under the Ain. From the scheme of the Ain as contemplated in the different sections of the Ain more particularly sections 4,5,6,26,28 and 47 it can be construed that Artha Rin Adalat is not a full-fledged Civil Court with all the powers and jurisdiction of a Civil Court. Rather it is a Civil Court of a defined and limited jurisdiction as contemplated in different provisions of the Ain. In view of the provisions of section 6(1) of the Ain holding of trial and disposing of any suit filed in an Artha Rin Adalat the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are applicable if these are not in conflict with the provisions of the Ain, 2003. Moreover, Section 26 provides that as regards execution of decree passed under this Ain the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are applicable if these are not in conflict with the provisions of the Ain. In the instant case, we are of the view that the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code are not in conflict with those of the Ain, 2003 inasmuch as the former is very much  in conformity with the provisions of section 6(5) of the Ain and as such the former is applicable in the instant suit.<br/><br/>The High Court Division also found that the Order No. 13 dated 06.04.2008 and Order No. 49 dated 19.01.2009 are not related to the administration of the Court and these orders cannot be passed by the learned Judge-In-Charge having the rank of an Additional District Judge. From the scheme of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 and the provisions of Section 4 of the Ain it is clear that the only persons legally competent to be appointed to act as Judges of the Artha Rin Adalat are Joint District Judges.   In view of Section 4 (7) of the Ain even those who are performing the functions of Judges–in-Charge of the Artha Rin Adalat shall have to be appointed from amongst the Joint District Judges. Therefore, the High Court Division rightly set aside those orders which were passed by the learned Judge-in-Charge who was holding the rank of Additional District Judge but part of the impugned Order No. 1 dated 23.01.2008 relating to the registration of the suit was kept valid as that was an administrative order.  The learned Additional District Judge has no jurisdiction to pass any judicial order in Artha Rin Suit in view of the provisions of Section 4 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. There is no illegality in the order of the High Court Division in nullifying the proceedings presided over by the learned Additional District Judge in the Artha Rin suit. As per provisions of Section 5 of the Ain any suit for recovery loan of any financial institution shall be filed and tried by Artha Rin Adalat. Section 5(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other provisions of law and subject to the provisions of Sub-Sections (5) and (6), any suit for realization of any loan shall be filed in the Artha Rin Adalat established, created or deemed to have been created and the suit shall be disposed of in the said Adalat. We have already opined that the learned Additional District Judge cannot be a Judge of Artha Rin Adalat as per provisions of Sub-Sections (4) and (7) of Section 4 of the said Ain, 2003. In view of the above observations and findings we are of the view that the impugned order of attachment before judgment passed by the learned Additional District Judge acting as a Judge of Artha Rin Adalat without having any power and jurisdiction being Coram non judice has been passed without lawful authority and  jurisdiction. We are in full agreement with the views taken by the High Court Division to the extent that the learned Additional District Judge who is in charge of the Artha Rin Adalat cannot pass any judicial order in relation to Artha Rin Suit. Therefore, we do not find any merit in the Civil Appeal No. 175 of 2011 and as such the appeal is liable to be dismissed.<br/><br/>In Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 on perusal of the record we find that Order No. 49 dated 19.01.2009 was not issued by the learned Additional District Judge, Chittagong rather it was passed by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1 Chittagong, who in fact being a Joint District Judge has been appointed legally in accordance with the provisions of law. It is regrettable to note that the High Court Division lost sight of this fact in deciding the case. The established principle of law is that either a necessary party or a proper party may be added in the suit. A necessary party is one in whose absence no effective decree can be passed. Where as a proper party is one whose presence is not necessary for passing an effective decree. The presence of proper party facilities more effectual and complete adjudication of all the disputes and avoid multiplicity of proceeding between the parties. A proper party is one who is legally interested in the suit. A legally interested party is one whose rights has been adversely affected by any order of a court.  It appears that order No.1 dated 23.01.2008 and order No. 13 dated 6.4.2008 of the Artha Rin Suit were passed for attachment of the property in question before judgment  and order No. 33 dated 11-09-2008 and  order No. 36 dated 18-09-2009 were passed restraining the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2012 by an order of temporary injunction from carrying on with any construction work on the property in question which have adversely affected the rights of the appellant as a developer. In that view of the  matters the appellant- developer being a proper party is entitled to be added as a party to the said Suit and as such Order No. 49 dated 19.1.2009 is illegal and without lawful authority for  not allowing it to be added as a party in the suit. Moreover, it has been asserted by the appellant that the agreement dated 26.7.2007 between the appellant-developer and the respondent No. 4 along with the power of attorney dated 25.09.2007 were executed after receiving Tk.6,14,00,000/- as consideration money long before filing of the suit on 23.01.2008. The appellant-developer further asserted that the property was transferred to the Chairman of the appellant company by sale deed No. 8401 dated 27.10.2008 and in view of the order of the attachment before judgment the property in question of Schedule-A to the writ petition no longer belonged to the respondent No.4. The appellant further asserted that its rights has been affected by order Nos.1, 13 (attachment before judgment), 33 and 36 (temporary injunction) passed by the respondent No.2 in the said suit and as such the appellant is a proper party to the suit. The appellant further stated that it acquired right, title, interest and possession in the disputed land by operation of law by way of redemption of equitable mortgage in respect of debt of the respondent No. 4 with Trust Bank Limited by making payment of Tk.6(six) crones vide cheque No. 02100139 dated 25.07.2007, i.e. long before filing of the suit and  the appellant-developer was put into possession in the said property and that the appellant had been clothed with the status of subrogee, mortgagee in possession, acquiring all the rights and obligations of the subrogator Trust Bank Ltd. On the other hand, it has been asserted that for the payment of mortgage money and sale price of beneficial interest of the Respondent No. 4 in the property, charge has already been created infavour of the appellant-developer much earlier than passing the order of attachment before judgment on 23.01.2008 and as such the appellant-developer is a proper party in the suit. Therefore, Order No. 49 dated 19.01.2009 is not sustainable in law. The High Court Division while making the Rule absolute upon setting aside the order No., 49 dated 19.05.2009 committed illegality by not allowing the appellant-developer to be added as a party in the suit under Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure inasmuch as Section 6(5) of the Ain which provides guidelines as to how the defendants can be impleaded in the proceedings of Artha Rin Suit is in conformity with the provisions of the aforesaid Order. In that view of the matter the appellant-developer is entitled to be added as a party in the suit in the category of defendant. Therefore we find merit in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011.<br/><br/>It appears that the appellant-developer of the Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 has been adversely affected by the judgment and order dated 19-01-2011 passed by the High Court Division making the rule absolute so far as it relates to setting aside of the Order No. 49 dated 19-01-2009 passed by the respondent No. 2 in Artha Rin Suit No. 7 of 2008 without passing any necessary order for making it as an added party in the suit in the category of defendant.  There is no provision in the Artha  Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 which debars a person adversely affected by the decision in an Artha Rin Suit from being added as a party to the suit. We find substance in the arguments put forward by the learned Senior Advocate for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011.<br/><br/>In view of the above observations and findings Civil Appeal No. 175 of 2011 is dismissed and Civil Appeal No. 176 of 2011 is, however, allowed. There is no order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Thereafter, Syed Abdus Sattar while was in peaceful possession of the said property died on 25.03.1971 leaving behind his only nephew Md. Ehsanul Hoque as his heir and since then Md. Ehsanul Hoque was in peaceful possession of the property in question without any hindrance from any quarter. Thereafter, the petitioner’s vendor Md. Ehsanul Hoque sworn an affidavit before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Dhaka on 19.05.1979 to the effect that he is the only surviving heir of late Syed Abdus Sattar, the original allottee under the Muslim Personal Law and he also obtained a succession certificate on 14.04.1979 in Succession Certificate Case No. 241 of 1979 from the 3<sup>rd</sup> Court of Subordinate Judge, Dhaka for the purpose of recovering loan money left by Syed Abdus Sattar from one Mr. Md. Nazrul Islam amounting to Tk. 925.00 (Annexure-B1 to the writ petition). The writ petitioners also stated that on 25.05.1979 they purchased the said property being House No. 13/A/A, Mirpur 1<sup>st</sup> Coloney under police Station Mirpur, Dhaka by two registered sale deeds from Md. Ehsanul Hoque and since the date of purchase the petitioners are paying all rent, taxes, bill etc. to the Revenue Office, WASA, DESA and City Corporation and their names were duly recorded in the Government Revenue Office and in the recent land survey conducted by the Government and thereby possessing the said property peacefully; but, the Government most illegally enlisted the property in question in the abandon property ‘Ka’ list, published in the official Gazette at page 976 (ka). It has further been stated that on 22.11.1983 the section officer of the Ministry of Public Works served a notice upon the petitioners for showing the original deeds and also served similar notice on 08.04.1984. While the writ petitioners submitted his documents and was advised to file an application before the Court of Settlement and accordingly, the petitioners filed case No. 125/96 (Ka-4, first Coloney, (Mirpur), Dhaka and the same was ultimately heard and dismissed on 31.07.2000, with the findings that the writ petitioners failed to prove the facts that his vendor was the heir of the original allottee and also found that the property was rightly enlisted as abandoned property.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved with the judgment and order of the Court of Settlement, the petitioners filed the writ petition and obtained the Rule Nisi.<br/><br/>Respondent No. 1 contested the Rule by filing an affidavit-in-opposition and supported the judgment and order dated 31.07.2000 passed by the learned Judge of the 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Settlement, the respondent No. 2 on stating that the writ petitioners annexed some forged and manufactured papers in order to establish his alleged false ownership and the Government has legally and rightly enlisted the property as abandoned property and also stated that the writ petitioners failed to show the whereabouts of the original allottee, Syed Abdus Sattar after 28.02.1972.<br/><br/>During pendency of the Rule the petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 died and their heirs were duly substituted.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Afzal Hossain, the learned advocate for the petitioners takes us through the Writ Petition as well as the annexures thereto, the materials on record and submits that the original allottee Syed Abdus Sattar died on 25.03.1971 leaving behind his only nephew Md. Ehsanul Hoque as his only heir and accordingly, the said Md. Ehsanul Hoque while in possession of the property in question sworn an affidavit before the Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Dhaka on 19.05.1979 declaring that he was the sole heir of Syed Abdus Sattar (Annexure-B to the writ petition) and also referred the succession certificate dated 14.04.1979 (Annexure-B1 to the writ petition) showing that Md. Ehsanul Hoque obtained the succession certificate from the Subordinate Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka for the purpose of recovering a loan of Tk. 925.00 as heir of the original allottee Syed Abdus Sattar and while Md. Ehsanul Hoque was in possession sold the land in question to the writ petitioners by two registered sale deeds dated 25.05.1979; but, the Government most illegally enlisted the property in question in the abandon property ‘Ka’ list, published in the official Gazette at page 976 (ka). He also submits that the inclusion of the disputed property in the ‘ka’ list has been without any lawful authority as the petitioners were in possession, till illegally dispossessed by the lessees of the Government. He also submits that after purchase the writ petitioners paid taxes to the Dhaka Municipality Corporation and the bills of gas connection. He further submits that the Government by Memo dated 08.04.1984 (Annexure-F to the writ petition) admitted the vendor of original writ petitioner as owner of the land in question; but, the Court of Settlement without considering those documents most illegally dismissed the case by the impugned judgment and order dated 31.07.2000, which is liable to be set-aside and the disputed Plot No. 13/A/A, 1<sup>st</sup> Coloney, Mirpur, Dhaka is liable to be released from the ‘ka’ list of the abandoned building as published in the Bangladesh Gazettee Extra Ordinary, on 23.09.1986. Mr. Hossain further submits that, in view of petitioners’ possession in the disputed property the same cannot be enlisted in “ka” schedule of the abandoned property. The learned advocate for the petitioners by citing two decisions reported in 53 DLR (AD) 55 and 54 DLR (AD) 100 and submits that notice as contemplated under sections 5 &amp; 7 of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance, 1985 (hereinafter referred as the Ordinance) was not issued upon the petitioner and as such the inclusion of the disputed property in the list of abandoned property is without lawful authority. Mr. Hossain, the learned advocate also referred a decision reported in 45 DLR 416 and submits, it is a condition precedent that the physical possession of a building must have to be taken over by the Government before enlisting any property in ‘ka’ list of the abandoned property. On referring those decision and facts as stated above the learned advocate for the petitioners prays for making the Rule absolute.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the respondent No. 1 takes us through the affidavit-in-opposition and annexures thereto and submits that the petitioners failed to prove before the Court of Settlement that the original allottee or his legal heirs if any, were present in Bangladesh on or after 28.02.1972 and also submits that the writ petitioners in order to grab the land in question created some false and forged documents and the Court of Settlement rightly disbelieve the documents filed by the writ petitioners. The learned Deputy Attorney General also placed before us the relevant article 2(1) and 6 of the President Order 16 of 1972 and section 5(2) of the Ordinance and also cited some decisions reported in 48 DLR (AD) 10, 3 BLC (AD) 42, 61 DLR (AD) 15, 49 DLR (AD) 161 and 59 DLR (AD) 165 and submits that in view of these decisions of our Apex Court, Government has no obligation to prove the property as abandoned property and it is only the writ petitioners who have to prove that the property is not abandoned property and also submits that, it is immaterial whether the abandoned property listed in ‘Ka’ or ‘Kha’ list of the abandoned property list as published and as such, he prays for discharging the Rule.<br/><br/>We have heard the learned advocate for the petitioners as well as the learned Deputy Attorney General for the respondent No. 1 and perused the writ petition, affidavit-in-opposition and annexures thereto.<br/><br/>It appears from the order sheet of this Court that by order dated 20.01.2009 this Court directed the respondent No. 2 to transmit the case record of Case No. 125 of 1996 (ka-4) regarding the House No. 13/A/A of 1<sup>st</sup> Coloney, Mirpur, Dhaka and accordingly, the record has been transmitted to this Court.<br/><br/>We have carefully examined the record of the Court of Settlement, and found that the writ petitioners examined 2(two) witnesses in order to prove their case before the Court of Settlement, amongst them P.W. 1 is Mohammad Nazrul Islam, who is a witness of the sale deeds dated 25.05.1979 and P.W. 2 Mohammad Siraj-Ud-Dowla also a witness of the sale deeds dated 25.05.1979 and they were examined only in order to prove the execution of the registered sale deeds dated 25.05.1979 and also filed the affidavit dated 19.05.1979 and the succession certificate dated 14.04.1979 in order to prove that Md. Ehsanul Hoque was the only heir of Syed Abdus Sattar the original allottee along with some other papers.<br/><br/>The petitioners though stated in the writ petition that the original allottee had died on 25.03.1971 leaving behind his only nephew (sister’s son) Md. Ehsanul Hoque as his heir and in order to prove the said fact filed two documents, one is an affidavit which was sworn before the Court of Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Dhaka on 19.05.1979 (annexure-B to the writ petition) and the other is a succession certificate dated 14.04.1979 (annexure-B1 to the writ petition). From those documents it appears that Md. Ehsanul Hoque on 19.05.1979 sworn an affidavit before the Court of Magistrate, 1<sup>st</sup> Class, Dhaka declaring himself as the sole heir of Syed Abdus Sattar and it appears from the succession certificate dated 14.04.1979, the same was obtained for recovering a loan of Tk. 925.00 only, while said Md. Ehsanul Hoque transferred the case land in question by two registered sale deeds dated 25.05.1979. So, it appears to us that only for the purpose of creating sale deeds dated 25.05.1979, showing Md. Ehsanul Hoque as the heir of Syed Abdus Sattar, the succession certificate dated 14.04.1979 and affidavit dated 19.05.1979 were obtained. Moreover, the writ petitioners failed to produce any documentary or oral evidences before the Court of Settlement to prove the fact that the original owner Syed Abdus Sattar or his legal heir was present in Bangladesh and occupied, managed or supervised the disputed property when President’s Order 16 of 1972 came into operation.<br/> <br/>Now let us consider the decisions placed before us by the respective parties. The learned advocate for the petitioners relied upon the case of Bangladesh Vs. Amela Khatoon and others, reported in 53 DLR (AD) 55, wherein our Hon’ble Appellate Division held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“High Court Division further found that according to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 5 of the Abandoned Buildings (Supplementary Provisions) Ordinance 1985 an abandoned property in possession of a person can only be included in the “kha” list of abandoned buildings in respect of which notice for surrendering or taking possession has been issued. Though the learned Deputy Attorney General referred to notices dated 06.11.1976, 07.06.1977 and 06.03.1986 mentioned in the judgment of the Court of Settlement he could not satisfy us that the said notices were issued to surrender possession of the disputed property treating the same as abandoned property. On going through the judgment of the Court of Settlement we find that those notices were issued on the respondent Nos. 1-6 to produce their vendor Bibi Homaira when they had applied for mutating their names after their purchase from Bibi Homaira. Thus it appears that the Government petitioner did neither treat the disputed property as abandoned property nor took any step to take over possession of the same till publication of Gazette notification in question. Since no notice as contemplated under section 5(1)(b) of the said Ordinance was issued to the respondent Nos. 1-6 or any other person inclusion of the disputed property in the “kha” list of the abandoned buildings is without lawful authority. In that view of the matter we do not find any merit in this petition to interfere with the impugned judgment.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>And in the case of Government of Bangladesh and others Vs. Bibi Marium and other, reported in 54 DLR (AD) 100 wherein their Lordships held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>It is now settled principle of law on interpretation of section 5(1)(b) of the Abandoned Buildings (supplementary provision) Ordinance, 1985 in the case of Bangladesh vs Amela Khatun and other 53 DLR (AD) 55 that since no notice as contemplated under section 5(1)(b) of the Ordinance was issued to the respondent or any other person inclusion of disputed property in the kha’ list of the abandoned building is without lawful authority. In the facts and circumstances of the case as detailed above and found by the High Court Division and that the judgment of the Court of Settlement is coram non judice, the illegal inclusion of the building in the ‘kha’ list of the abandoned building and that no notice having been served to the petitioner or other predecessor, the said inclusion is without any lawful authority.</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>And in the case of Iqbal Ahmed Quraishi Vs. Bangladesh represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Works, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Dhaka, reported in 45 DLR 416, wherein a Division Bench of the High Court Division held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>Therefore, it is a condition precedent that the physical possession of building must have been taken over by the Government before it could be listed as an abandoned property under Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 5 of the Ordinance i.e. published in the official Gazette.</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On the other hand, it appears from the decisions cited by the learned Deputy Attorney General in the case of Government of Bangladesh Vs. Md. Jalil and others, reported in 48 DLR (AD)10, that their Lordships held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>The Government has no obligation either to deny the facts alleged by the claimant or to disclose the basis of treating the property as abandoned property merely because the same is disputed by the claimant.</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>And in the case of Hazerullah and another Vs. Chairman, 1<sup>st</sup> Court of settlement and another, reported in 3 BLC (AD) 42, their Lordships held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“This contention will stand only when the claimant can prove that the disputed building was not an abandoned property. In case before the Court of settlement, main question is, whether the disputed house answers the description of “abandoned property” as defined in article 2 (1) of <strong><u>Bangladesh Abandoned property (Control, managemnt4 and Disposal) Order, 1972(PO No. 16 of 1972), briefly, “the </u>Order”. Under clause (1) of Article 2 of the Order <u>‘abandoned Property, inter alia, means any property owned by any person who is not present in Bangladesh or whose whereabouts are not known or who has ceased to occupy, supervise or manage in person his property. </u></strong></em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Section 5(2) of the Ordinance provides that a list of the buildings published under sub-section (1) thereof, shall be conclusive evidence that the buildings included therein are abandoned property and have vested in the Government as such.</em><br/><em>……………………………………………….. </em><br/><em>Before the Court of Settlement the petitioner could not product any evidence that the said Abdur Rahim or his alleged heirs had been present in Bangladesh during after the war of liberation and that their whereabouts were known to the respondent Government or that the said Abdur Rahim had been occupying supervising and managing the disputed property as on 28-2-72. <strong>The said court on consideration of <u>the materials on record held that the original lessee Abdur </u>Rahim and his heirs at the relevant time were not traceable <u>in Bangladesh and that the appellants had unauthorisedly been occupying the property in question since 28-03-72. As such, it is immaterial, as far as the appellants are concerned whether the disputed property was published in the ‘Ka’ or </u>‘Kha’ list.” </strong></em><br/><em>(Bold, emphasis given) </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>And in the case of Golam Rabbani Vs. Chairman, Court of Settlement and others, reported in 61 DLR (AD) 15, their Lordships decided as under:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>In the case of Hazerullah vs Chairman, 1<sup>st</sup> Court of Settlement reported in 3 BLC (AD) 42 it was held that it is immaterial whether the disputed property was listed in the ‘ka’ or ‘kha’ list, it is the abandoned character of the property which is the main criteria for determining the whole matter.</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>And in the case of Government of Bangladesh Vs. Ashraf Ali @ Ashraf Ali and another, reported in 49 DLR (AD) 161, wherein their Lordships held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>It has been held by this Division in various decisions that the enlistment of a building under section 5(1) of the Ordinance 54 of 1985 raises a presumption in law that the property is an abandoned property under section 5(2) of the Ordinance. This presumption is, of course, a rebuttable presumption but respondent No. 1 failed to rebut this presumption. No rebuttable evidence could be adduced to show that original owner Yahiya was present in Bangladesh and he occupied, managed or supervised the disputed building when President’s Order 16 of 1972 came into operation. Hence, the listing of the property as an abandoned property in the Supplementary Provisions Ordinance, 1985 was lawful as it was an abandoned property by operation of law.</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>And lastly in the case of Rowshan Ara Begum Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Works and Urban Development, Government of Bangladesh and others, reported in 59 DLR (AD) 165, wherein their Lordships held that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>In the instant case the petitioner having not been able to establish before the Court of Settlement that the claimant of the property or for that matter her vendor Anwari Khatun were present in Bangladesh on 28.02.1972 and consequent thereupon the property having had assumed the character of abandoned property, the listing of the property in question, even if without service of notice as per provision of Ordinance No. 54 of 1985, is not material as the property because of non-service of notice for listing in the list of abandoned properties would not cease to be an abandoned property and consequent there upon the claim of title made by the petitioner in the property in question is not legally sustainable</em>”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On considering the facts and circumst-ances of the case we are of the view that the writ petitioners failed to prove that Syed Abdus Sattar or his legal heir ever occupied, managed or supervised in person the land in question on or after 28.02.1972. Only 2(two) witnesses were examined by the writ petitioners before the Court of Settlement to prove the execution of the alleged sale deeds of 1979 and no other oral or documentary evidences were produced before the Court of Settlement to prove the petitioner’s case. Moreover, the enlistment of the disputed property under the Ordinance raises a presumption in law that the property is an abandoned property under section 5(2) of the Ordinance. This presumption is, of course, a rebuttable presumption but the petitioners failed to rebut this presumption. No rebuttable evidence could be adduced to show that original owner Syed Abdus Sattar or his legal heir was present in Bangladesh and had occupied, managed or supervised the disputed building when President’s Order 16 of 1972 came into operation. Hence, the listing of the property as an abandoned property was lawful as it was an abandoned property by operation of law. Further, the petitioners having not been able to establish before the Court of Settlement that their vendor Syed Abdus Sattar was present in Bangladesh on or after 28.02.1972 and consequent thereupon the property having assumed the character of abandoned property, the listing of the property in question, even if without service of notice as per provision of Ordinance, is not material as the property because due to non-service of notice for listing the property in the list of abandoned property would not change the fact that the property is an abandoned property and consequent, there upon the claim of title made by the petitioners in the property in question is not legally sustainable. The Government has no obligation either to deny the facts alleged by the claimant or to disclose the basis of treating the property as abandoned property merely because the same is disputed by the petitioners<em>. </em>It is immaterial whether the disputed property was listed in the ‘ka’ or ‘kha’ list, it is the abandoned character of the property which is the main criteria for determining the whole matter.<br/> <br/>We as such, find that the writ petitioners failed to prove their case that their vendor Md. Ehsanul Hoque was the heir of the original allottee Syed Abdus Sattar and that Syed Abdus Sattar or his legal heir had occupied, managed or supervised the property in question on or after 28.02.1972 and the same was rightly listed as abandoned property. Therefore, the Court of Settlement rightly found that,</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>‘‘প্রার্থী পক্ষের দাখিলী কাগজাদি এবং সরকার পক্ষের দাখিলী সরকারী নথি পর্যালোচনা করিলাম। নালিশী সম্পত্তি সরকার জনৈক মোহাজের (Refugee) আবদুস সাত্তারের অনুকূলে কিছু শর্ত সম্বলিত অরেজিষ্ট্রিকৃত লিজ এগ্রিমেন্ট মূলে বিগত ২৪-৭-৫৩ইং তারিখ বরাদ্দ প্রদান করেন, ইহা সর্বস্বীকৃত। প্রার্থীগনের দাবী হইল লীজ গ্রহীতা আবদুস সাত্তার নিঃসমত্মান অবস্থায় বোনের ছেলেকে একমাত্র ওয়ারিশ রাখিয়া মারা গেলে এহসানুল হক লীজ গ্রহীতার উত্তরাধিকার সূত্রে মালিক হিসাবে নালিশী সম্পত্তি বিগত ২৫-২-৭৯ইং তারিখে প্রার্থীগনের অনুকূলে বিক্রয় করে এবং খরিদা সূত্রে প্রার্থীগন বর্তমানে নালিশী সম্পত্তি ভোগ দখল করিতেছে। সরকার পক্ষ প্রার্থী পক্ষের এই দাবী অস্বীকার করিয়া উল্লেক্ষ করেন যে, লীজ গ্রহীতা স্বাধীনতা যুদ্ধের সময়ে স্বপরিবারে এদেশ ত্যাগ করে এবং স্বাধীনতার পর হইতে এ যাবত তাহার অবস্থান অজ্ঞাত নিঃসমত্মান অবস্থায় এদেশে তাহার মৃত্যু এবং এহসানুল হক তাহার বোনের ছেলে ইহা প্রার্থীপক্ষের কাল্পনিক গল্পই বটে। তৎমর্মে কোন প্রকার স্বীকৃত কাগজাদি প্রার্থী পÿ দাখিল করে নাই। প্রার্থী পক্ষের ১নং সাক্ষী জনাব নুরুল ইসলাম জেরাতে বলেন তিনি প্রার্থীগনের খরিদা দলিলে স্বাক্ষী আছেন। কিন্তু এই সাক্ষী দলিলে কি লিখা আছে বা কত টাকা লেনদেন হইয়াছে তৎমর্মে কিছুই বলিতে পারেন না। এই স্বাক্ষী ১৯৭৬ সাল হইতে ১৯৭৯ ইং সাল পর্যমত্ম এই বাড়িতে এহসানুল হকের ভাড়াটিয়া ছিল বলিলেও এহসানুল হক কি সূত্রে বাড়ির মালিক চিল কিছুই বলিতে পারেন না। এই সাক্ষী আরোও স্বীকার করেন যে, ১৯৭৬ সালের পূর্বে নালিশী সম্পত্তি পরিত্যক্ত অবস্থায় ছিল। ২ নং স্বাক্ষী জনাব সিরাজউদ্দৌলা জেরাতে এহসানুল হক কিভাবে নালিশী সম্পত্তির মালিক হইয়াছেন সেই সম্পর্কে কিছুই বলিতে পারেন নাই। এই ক্ষেত্রে নালিশী সম্পত্তির লীজ গ্রহীতার একমাত্র ওয়ারিশ সূত্রে এহসানুল হক নালিশী সম্পত্তির মালিক বা দখলকার ছিলেন ইহা প্রমান করিতে পারেন নাই। মূল মালিকের মৃত্যু ও তাহার ওয়ারিশ সম্পর্কে স্বীকৃত প্রমান প্রার্থীপক্ষ যেহেতু দাখিল করিতে ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন, সেইহেতু প্রার্থীপক্ষ তাহাদের মোকদ্দমার প্রার্থীত প্রতিকার পাইতে পারেন না। সেইহেতু তাহাদের মোকদ্দমা খারিজযোগ্য।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Accordingly, we do not find substance in the arguments of the learned advocate for the petitioners and find substance in the arguments of the learned Deputy Attorney General for the respondent No. 1.<br/>In the result, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs.<br/><br/>Send down the record of the Court of Settlement.<br/><br/>Communicate the judgment to respondent No. 1 at once.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

(15)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102(2) </strong><br/><strong>There is a fundamental difference between an action taken or the decision made by the </strong><strong>government or any Constitutional or statutory</strong><strong> body and the proceedings initiated or trial commenced by the said bodies; meaning that when any proceeding is pending before any judicial or quasi-judicial body, this Court is usually reluctant to interfere with the said proceedings save in a rare of the rarest case as this Court adheres to the long established age old principle that “<em>a person cannot pursue two parallel remedies in respect of the same matter at the same time</em>” inasmuch as it is the common law policy that when there is an availability of alternative remedy, the jurisdiction of the High Court Division should not be invoked directly, which has been enshrined in Article 102(2)(a) of our Constitution in the following words: “If satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy provided by law.”...(16)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102(2) </strong><br/><strong>Subject to the ‘satisfaction’ of this Court, a writ petition may be entertained. It appears from the words employed in the said Article that ‘if satisfied’ strongly suggests that this ‘Special original jurisdiction’ of the High Court Division may be invoked only upon the <u>satisfaction</u> of the High Court Division as to the non-availability of the ‘other equally efficacious remedy’ (underlined for emphasize). In our view, the scrutiny as to the competency of invoking this ‘Special original jurisdiction’ is required to be made by this Court <u>before</u> issuance of any Rule, not <u>by issuing</u> of any Rule in view of the clear and unambiguous words of our Constitution ‘if satisfied.’. . . (19)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102(2) </strong><br/><strong>There are classifications in the alternative </strong><strong>forum. Some forums are administrative appellate</strong><strong> forum created by the ordinary statutory provisions and some forums are created under the mandate of the Constitution such as the Election Commission. The bottom line is that the High Court Division has always been reluctant to interfere with the functions of any Constitutional body unless the said Constitutional body transgresses its power and acts beyond its jurisdiction. ...(20)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Representation of People Order </strong><br/><strong>(P.O.

Thus, in view of the fact that the Election Commission</strong><strong> has already initiated a proceeding, be it within the scope of RPO or under the misconception of any provisions of the said law, and since the petitioners already have explained their position before them and, further, before issuance of this writ petitions the Election Commission was in seisin of the matter, this Court is of the opinion that the Election Commission is in a convenient position to adjudicate upon the allegation brought against the petitioners. Accordingly, we are led to hold that these writ petitions are pre-nature as the impugned notices are being awaited to be disposed of by an </strong><strong>apparently competent quasi-judicial body upon</strong> <strong>the hearing of the parties.  However, in carrying</strong><strong> out the above exercise, this Court would not delve into deciding the issue as to whether the actions of the Election Commission was legal or illegal and if we inadvertently fail to </strong><strong>resist our temptation of expressing our views,</strong><strong> it should be ignored. . . .

At the phase of scrutiny on 13.12.2013, since there was no other contesting candidate, the Returning Officer under his seal and signature declared Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin as the Returned Candidate for the said constituency no. 85, Jessore-1 by a public notice under article 19(1) of the Representation of the People Order, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as RPO) when the copy of the same was supplied to Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin by the Returning Officer and, that is how, Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin was elected as an MP and he was merely waiting to get his name published in the Gazette Notification. On 01.01.2014 one Md. Shahin-Ul-Kabir, the election agent of a candidate against the Awami League nominated candidate for another seat namely constituency no. 86 of Jessore-2 lodged a complaint to the Election Commission alleging that Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin has committed offences under the RPO as he conspired with the workers and supporters of the Awami League uttering that he shall ensure the victory of Mr. Monirul Islam (petitioner in writ petition No. 329 of 2014) by any means by engaging at least 100 workers in various polling stations to cast as much vote as required for the victory of the said Awami League candidate Mr. Monirul Islam, which was published in the several news papers of the country. Pursuant to lodging the aforesaid complaint, the Election Commission formed an Electoral Inquiry Committee who, upon carrying out the inquiry, found the allegation to be true. After holding the National Election on 05.01.2014 in whole of the country the Election Commission, on 07.01.2014, issued a notice upon Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin directing him to show cause as to why his candidature shall not be cancelled for the allegation brought against him by the said Mr. Shahin-Ul-Kabir. On 15.01.2014 Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin replied to the show cause notice denying the charges and explaining his position contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was declared a Returned Candidate by the Returning Officer on 13.12.2013 as an uncontested candidate and as a worker of Awami League he had been to Jessore-2 constituency to lend political support to Mr. Monirul Islam,  the candidate of Awami League for the said constituency, but he never did anything which comes within the purview of election offence or corrupt practice or vote rigging and, in fact, on 05.01.2014 on the date of election there was no vote rigging or corrupt practice and no election offence took place therein or there was no other allegation in the election of Jessore-2 constituency. It was stated that out of enmity with Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin, the opposition candidate against Mr. Monirul Islam with an ill motive created a fake C.D in the name of Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin. It is further stated that the Electoral Enquiry Committee did not hold any enquiry in presence or within the knowledge of Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin and he was not given any opportunity to defend himself. Thereafter, when on 08.01.2014 the Election Commission published the result of the 10<sup>th</sup> National Parliamentary Election held on 05.01.2014 in the official Gazette, the name of Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin was not included in the said official Gazette dated 08.01.2014. In the aforestated premises, Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin being aggrieved by the said action of the Election Commission approached this Court as a petitioner and obtained the instant Rule.<br/> <br/>In writ petition no. 329 of 2014 the stated facts of the case, briefly, are that the petitioner (Mr. Monirul Islam), having been nominated by the Bangladesh Awami League as a candidate in the 10<sup>th</sup> National Parliamentary Election, submitted his nomination paper for constituency no. 86 of Jessore-2 and, at the stage of scrutiny, his nomination paper was found to be valid and after the withdrawal of the nomination papers of other 2 contesting candidates, there were only 2 contesting candidates namely, Mr. Monirul Islam (the petitioner) and Mr. Rafiqul Islam (the added respondent no. 2). On 05.01.2014 polling took place at all the 72 polling centers and, after free, fair and peaceful and uncorrupted casting of votes in all the pooling centers, counting of the votes was completed peacefully by the Presiding Officers of all the polling centers and upon signing their respective result sheets they handed over the same to the Returning Officer and after receiving all the result sheets of all the polling centers the Returning Officer consolidated the result and having found Mr. Monirul Islam with the highest number of votes, on 06.01.2014 the former under his seal and signature declared the latter as a Returned Candidate by a public notice under Article 39(1) of the RPO. Meanwhile, one Mr. Shahin-Ul-Kabir, an election agent of respondent no. 2 (opposition candidate against him), lodged complaint on 01.01.2014 alleging that on 30.12.2013 Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin made a promise to the Bangladesh Awami League supporters and workers that he shall do everything for the victory of Mr. Monirul Islam by engaging 100 workers at different polling stations, which was published in the several news papers of the country. On an enquiry the Electoral Enquiry Committee found the allegation to be true. Thereafter, on 07.01.2014 the Election Commission issued the impugned notice upon Mr. Monirul Islam directing him to show cause as to why his candidature shall not be declared illegal for the allegation brought against him by one Md. Shahin-Ul-Kabir. Pursuant to the said show cause notice Mr. Monirul Islam replied on 15.02.2014 denying the charges against him and explained his position. He stated in the said reply that Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin visited his constituency as a leader of the Awami League to lend support to him but he never got involved in any corrupt practice and, most importantly, no offence of vote rigging or any corrupt practice took place on the date of national election in this constituency. The allegation brought against him and Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin is nothing but a sheer conspiracy against them. The Election Commission, then, on 08.01.2014 published the result of the 10<sup>th</sup> National Parliamentary Election held on 05.01.2014 vide publication of the Gazette Notification when the name of Mr. Monirul Islam was not included in the said Official Gazette and having not found his name in the official Gazette Mr. Monirul Islam approached this Court as the petitioner and obtained this Rule.<br/> <br/>In both the writ petitions the Election Commission (respondent no.1) and Mr. Rafiqul Islam (added respondent no. 2) who is the contesting candidate against Mr. Monirul Islam entered their appearances by filing separate sets of affidavits-in-opposition. In the affidavit-in-opposition filed by respondent no. 1, it is stated that when respondent no. 1 declared the schedule of the 10<sup>th</sup> Parliamentary Election in all parliamentary constituencies of the country as per the provisions of RPO, it appointed the Returning Officers and the Assistant Returning Officers for the said election throughout the country. In writ petition no. 328 of 2014 Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin was found to be the sole candidate in the constituency no. 85 of Jessore-1and since there was no other candidate in the said constituency the relevant Returning Officer after his scrutiny on 13.12.2013 declared him as the ‘Returned Candidate’ for the said constituency vide public notice dated 13.12.2013. When one Md. Shahin-Ul-Kabir lodged a complaint to respondent no. 1 on 01.01.2014 bringing some allegation against Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin that he has committed offence under RPO as he openly declared that the victory of Mr. Monirul Islam shall be ensured by hook or crook engaging 100 workers at the different polling stations, the said allegations was enquired into by the Electoral Enquiry Committee who submitted its report on 03.01.2014 confirming the veracity of the said election and found violation of the Code of Conduct by Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin. Then, respondent no. 1 issued a show cause notice upon both the writ petitioners Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin and Mr. Monirul Islam on 07.01.2014 asking them to show cause as to why their candidatures shall not be cancelled and both of them on 15.01.2014 replied to the said show cause notices. Respondent no. 1 after receiving the said replies from both the writ petitioners decided to afford personal hearing to both of them and issued letters to them on 21.01.2014 fixing 27.01.2014 as the date for personal hearing. While the matter was pending before respondent no. 1 who was about to dispose of the same, both the writ petitioners filed the present writ petitions seeking a direction upon respondent no. 1 to publish their respective results of the Parliamentary Election in the Official Gazette. Respondent no.1, on 27.01.2014, under the compelling circumstances decided to postpone the personal hearing of both the writ petitioners as the High Court Division was in seisin of the matters.<br/> <br/>Respondent no. 2 by filing a separate affidavit-in-opposition stated that both the writ petitions have been filed by suppressing some relevant facts necessary for disposal of this writ petitions; such as, both the writ petitioners appeared before the Electoral Enquiry Committee and made their respective representations therein but in their writ petitions they have totally denied the aforesaid facts. It is stated that after registering the complaint by respondent no. 2 with respondent no. 1, steps were taken to enquire into the matter and Election Enquiry Committee was formed to adjudicate upon the complaint but due to seeking adjournment by both the petitioners, there was no final resolution before the election held on 05.01.2014. It is stated that both the writ petitioners are, in fact, attempting to bypass the consequence of the offence committed by them by filing these writ petitions. The rest of the statements made by this respondent are mere repetition of the statements made by the respondent no. 1 in its affidavit-in-opposition.<br/> <br/>Mr. Rafique-ul-Haque, along with Mr. M. Kamrul Haque Siddique, the learned advocates, appeared for both the writ petitioners. However, Mr. Haque inspired Mr. Siddique to take the lead role in making submissions before this Court. At the very outset of placing the petitioners’ cases, Mr. Siddique refers to annexure-A to both the writ petition and submits that these are public notices published by the Returning Officers and these public notices can be published only by the Returning Officers, as per the provisions of RPO, not by the Election Commission or any other authority. Mr. Siddique submits that the Returning Officers for Parliamentary Election are appointed by respondent no. 1 but in performing their functions and exercising their power, they are independent entity and respondent no. 1 cannot dictate them to refrain from publishing the said public notice once the election is held peacefully without any allegation of vote rigging or other corrupt practice and, more importantly, after publication of the aforesaid public notice by the Returning Officer, respondent no. 1 does not have any authority to withhold publication of the Gazette Notification as  per the provisions of article 19(1), 19(2) and 19(3) of the RPO as the aforesaid law contemplate that after the election is held uncontested the result is to be declared by the Returning Officer and after the declaration of the result by the Returning Officer, respondent no. 1 has no option but to publish the Gazette Notification. By placing the provisions of article 39(1), 39(2), 39(3) and 39(4) of the RPO Mr. Siddique submits that respondent no. 1 after the Returning Officer’s declaration under article 39(1) of the RPO must complete the formality of the publication of the Gazette Notification as quickly as possible without making any delay; otherwise their failure may result in rendering the spirit of our Constitution and scheme of the RPO nugatory. In an endeavour to substantiate his arguments he submits that respondent no. 1 is duty bound to take next step as envisaged in articles 19 (3) and 39(3) after completion of the tasks under articles 19(1) &amp; 19(2) and articles 39(1) &amp; 39(2) as respondent no. 1 being a Constitutional body cannot behave like a natural person as per its whims and wishes, rather it is obliged to act in accordance with the provisions of the law as enshrined in the RPO and the Rules framed thereunder. In a bid to augment his deliberation on this point Mr. Siddique refers to the celebrated case of Marbury Vs. Madison reported in 2 Law Edition USSCR 135 and submits that once the Returning Officer has declared the result by publication of public notice, the publication of Gazette Notification by respondent no. 1 remains to be observed as a mere formality. He places Article 72(2) and 148 of the Constitution and submits that the above Constitutional provisions have been made nugatory by not publishing the names of the petitioners in the Gazette Notification within thirty days from 08.01.2014 when the names of all other candidates having been declared Returned under articles 19(1)&amp;39(1) were published in the Gazette Notification.  Then, he refers to annexure-B to the writ petition and questions the jurisdiction and power of respondent no. 1 in proceeding with the complaints as he claims that the petitioners are the Returned Candidates in the eye of law and the 10<sup>th</sup> Parliamentary Election having been completed Election Tribunal has already been set up and, thus, the matter should be dealt with and adjudicated upon by the Election Tribunal only. In support of his submission on this point he refers to the cases of AFM Shah Alam Vs Mujibull Huq 41 DLR (AD) 68, Mahmudul Haque (Md.) Vs Md Hedayetullah and others 48 DLR (AD) 128, AKM Mayeedul Islam Vs Bangadesh Election Commission and others 16 BLD (AD) 204 and DR. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir Vs Bangladesh 62 DLR (AD) 425. He further submits that interpretation of several articles of the RPO is required for fair disposal of the allegations brought against the petitioners and, therefore, this Court being the only competent authority to interpret the law, the matters are beyond the jurisdiction of the Election Commission. He finally submits that the petitioners are happy and willing to face the proceedings pending before respondent no. 1 having been arisen out of the complaint lodged by respondent no. 2 but respondent no.1 cannot withhold the publication of Gazette Notification on the plea of pendency of that proceeding inasmuch as they are now elected MPs of the 10<sup>th</sup> Parliament and, thus, if the outcome of the proceedings pending before respondent no. 1 goes against the petitioners towards acquiring a disqualification to remain as an MP under Article 66 of our Constitution, it may be notified to the Hon’ble Speaker who will then proceed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution and other relevant law. By making the aforerecorded submissions the learned advocate for the petitioners prays for making the Rule absolute.<br/> <br/>Per contra, Mr. M.K. Rahman, the learned advocate, appearing for respondent no. 1, submits that that the Election Commission having been constituted under Article 118 of the Constitution is responsible to undertake the election related functions of the country as have been enumerated in Article 119. Mr. Rahman takes us through articles 12, 17, 81(1)(F), 91(A), 91(B), 91D, 91(E) &amp; 92 of the RPO, Rule 8 &amp; 27 of the নির্বাচন পরিচালনা বিধিমালা, ২০০৮ (hereinafter referred to as বিধিমালা, ২০০৮) and Code no. 2(6) of the নির্বাচনে রাজনৈতিক দল ও প্রার্থীর আচরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০৮ (hereinafter referred to as Code of Conducts, 2008) and submits that Election Commission is amply empowered to take any steps for ensuring free, fair and just election including conducting investigation as to any allegation of corrupt practice, violation of the Code of Conducts brought by any candidate, agent or anyone during the poll time and passing an order or direction for re-poll. By referring to annexure-B to the writ petition he submits that the Election Commission has rightly issued the notices as after carrying out the enquiry by the competent authority i.e. Electoral Enquiry Committee, which had found the allegations brought against the petitioners to be true, it was revealed that the conducts of both the writ petitioners do fall within the ambit of the provisions of article 81(1)(f) of the RPO and, thus, the Election Commission being duty bound under article 91E of the RPO to proceed further with the complaint, has issued the impugned notices to the petitioners. He emphasizes on the fact that when the petitioners replied to the said show cause notices they ought to have waited for the decision of the Election Commission and, as such, Mr. Rahman terms the action of the petitioners in filing these writ petitions to be pre-mature. He places the definition of ‘নির্বাচন পূর্ব সময়’ as provided in Code no. 2(6) of the Code of Conducts, 2008 and submits that the election time includes from the date of declaration of the schedule till publication of the Gazette Notification and the Election Commission, having not published the Gazette Notification for these two constituencies, is empowered to take any step including making enquiry into any allegation under article 91E of the RPO and, thereafter, ordering for re-poll therein under article 17 of the RPO in necessary. He submits that Rules 8 and 27 of the Rule, 2008 contemplate that the Returning Officer cannot make any declaration or issue public notice under article 19(1) or under 39(1) of the RPO without having written approval from the Election Commission. He finally submits that Section 21of the General Clauses Act, 1897 empowers the Election Commission to amend, vary or even rescind those public notices inasmuch as no vested right has been accrued by the petitioners before the election results of the petitioners reach to its finality by publication of the Gazette Notification. <br/> <br/>Mr. Sharder Abul Hossain, the learned advocate appearing for respondent no. 2, in addition to adopting the submissions advanced by the learned advocate for respondent no. 1, adds that the Election Commission should be allowed to proceed with the proceedings pending before it having been culminated from the inquiry of the Electoral Enquiry Committee which had found the veracity of the allegation brought by this respondent and the said proceedings would succumb to unnatural death if this Court interferes with it at this juncture. In corroboration of his submissions he refers to the cases of Altaf Hossain Vs Abul Kashem 45 DLR (AD) 53 and Afzal Hossain VS Chief Election Commissioner 45 DLR 255 and submits that the Election Commission has the plenary power to act under Article 119 which is the reservoir of power for it to ensure fair election. By making the aforerecorded submissions, the learned advocate for the respondents pray for discharging both the Rules with costs. <br/> <br/>We have heard the learned advocates for both the sides, perused the writ petitions as well as affidavits-in-opposition together with the annexures appended thereto and the relevant laws and decisions placed before us and we have considered them very carefully.<br/> <br/>The moot questions for consideration by this Court are whether the Election Commission has the power and jurisdiction to issue the impugned notices. In other words, this Court is to examine as to whether the impugned notices have been issued in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution and the RPO. Further, to examine as to whether the present writ petitions are pre-mature having the consequence thereto of being not maintainable when the Election Commission was in seisin of the matter.<br/> <br/>Since the issue of maintainability of the writ petition on the ground of being pre-mature has been raised, the same may be taken up first for consideration and adjudication. It is an admitted position that Election Commission is in seisin of the matters. When the Election Commission issued annexure-B to both the writ petitioners asking them to show cause as to why their respective candidatures of 10<sup>th</sup> Parliamentary Election shall not be cancelled under Article 91E of the RPO accusing the petitioners for committing offences under article 81(1)(f) of the RPO within 10 days from the date of receiving of their respective notices and, in compliance thereto, both the writ petitioners vide annexure-C to the writ petitions furnished their explanations in details within the stipulated time with the following prayers:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“পরিশেষে আমার সবিনয় নিবেদন এই যে, মিথ্যা অভিযোগের দায় থেকে অব্যহতি দিয়ে আমাকে বাধিত করবেনz এই জবাবে লিখিত বক্তব্য এবং ঘটনা সম্পর্কিত অামার বক্তব্য সমূহের সমর্থনে আমি নিজে ব্যক্তিগত শুনানী করতে চাই এবং আইনের ব্যাখ্যা বিশ্লেষন সংশ্লিষ্ট বিষয়ে আইনজীবির মাধ্যমে শুনানীর সুযোগ দেওয়ার জন্য আবেদন করছি”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>After receiving the said replies from the petitioners, the Election Commission fixed 27.01.2014 as the date for hearing of the complaints towards disposal of the same as per the requests made in the writ petitioners’ reply to give an opportunity for personal hearing. However, on the above day of hearing, the Election Commission suo-muto stayed the proceedings pending before them by the order appended as annexure-4 to the affidavit-in-opposition which may be quoted here under-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“দেখিলাম অদ্য যশোর-১ আসনের ও যশোর-২ আসনের প্রার্থীদ্বয়ের বিরুদ্ধে নির্বাচনী আচরণ বিধি ভঙ্গের অভিযোগে তাহাদের ব্যক্তিগত শুনানির জন্য ধার্য্য রহিয়াছেz ইতিমধ্যে উভয় প্রার্থী মাননীয় সুপ্রীম কোর্টের হাইকোর্ট বিভাগে দুইটি রীট পিটিশন করিলে মাননীয় হাইকোর্ট হইতে রুল ইস্যু করা সম্বলিত নোটিশ পাওয়া গিয়াছেz এমতাবসÛায় শুনানির বিষয়টি মাননীয় উচ্চ আদালতে বিচারাধীন বিধায় ব্যক্তিগত শুনানির কার্য্যত্র্ম সÛগিত করা হইল মাননীয় উচ্চ আদালতের আদেশ সাপেক্ষে পরবর্তী ব্যবসগ্রহণ করা হইবে ”  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a close reading of the aforegoing order dated 27.01.2014 passed by the Election Commission, it appears that due to pendency of these writ petitions, the Election Commission decided to suo-muto stay the proceedings arisen out of annexure-B to both the writ petitions until they receive any direction from this Court.<br/> <br/>From the chronology of events of these cases it transpires that annexure-B to the writ petitions were issued on 07.01.2014 and the petitioners of both this writ petitions replied thereto on 15.01.2014 and the instant writ petitions were filed on 10.02.2014. Thus, it is evident that both these writ petitions were filed after the petitioners submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Election Commission. Mr. Kamrul Haque Siddique put his best effort to cover-up this point by referring to the last line of paragraph no. 5 of the replies to the show cause notices (annexure-C to both the writ petitions) which runs as follows: “আমি গেজেট বিজ্ঞপ্তি প্রকাশের দাবিতে অতি সত্তর মাননীয় হাইকোর্ট বিভাগে রীট মামলা দায়ের করার পরামর্শ প্রাপ্ত হয়েছি”. In his bid to justify the filings of these writ petitions before this Court he submits that the petitioners, by replying to the show cause notices, had merely complied with the directions given by the Election Commission in annexure-B but they had informed the Election Commission that they are in the process of invoking writ jurisdiction against the actions of the Election Commission for non-inclusion of their names in the Gazette Notification dated 08.01.2014, which published for the purpose of according official recognition to all of the ‘Returned Candidates’ as Member of Parliaments of the 10<sup>th</sup> National Parliament. The above submissions advanced by the learned advocate Mr. Siddique could hardly persuade this Court inasmuch as from the prayer portion of the annexure-4 to the affidavit-in-opposition submitted by respondent no. 1 any one with ordinary prudence would come to a conclusion that the petitioners have totally surrendered themselves to the jurisdiction of the Election Commission for the disposal of the complaints.<br/> <br/>The main ground for filing these writ petitions, as advanced <em>in extensio </em>by the learned advocate for the petitioner, is that since the Election Commission lacks jurisdiction to issue the impugned notices (annexure-B to both the writ petitions) there is a long line of decisions of our Apex Court that the High Court Division is well empowered to entertain writ petitions. True that the High Court Division in the fit and proper cases, for example, where an action taken or order passed by a Government or any statutory body or even any Constitutional body is exfacie illegal, malafide, or the same suffers from malice-in-law or quorum non-judice in carrying out its functions within administrative capacity, entertains writ petitions inspite of the existence of alternative forums. But the High Court Division does not usually interfere with an action or order of the said bodies when they act within judicial or quasi-judicial capacity and unless the said issues have been dealt with and adjudicated upon by the said judicial or quasi-judicial bodies themselves. Here, these cases have been filed against the actions taken by a quasi-judicial body performing its duty under article 91D of the RPO, which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 91D </strong>(1) The Commission, while making an enquiry under any provision of this Order, shall have, for the purposes of such enquiry, all the powers of a civil Court trying a suit under the <u>Code of Civil Procedure</u>, 1908 (Act V of 1908), in respect of the following matters, namely:-<br/>(a)   summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath;<br/>(b)  requiring the discovery and production of any document or other material object producible as evidence;<br/>(c)  receiving evidence on affidavit;<br/>(d)  requisitioning any public record or any copy thereof from any Court or office;<br/>(e)  issuing commission for examination of witnesses or documents.<br/>(2) Any proceeding before the Commission shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 and 228 of the <u>Penal Code</u> (XLV) of 1860).<br/>(3) The Commission shall be deemed to be a civil Court within the meaning of sections 476, 480, and 482 of the <u>Code of Criminal Procedure</u>, 1898 (V of 1898). <br/>(4) The Commission shall have the power to regulate its own procedure.<br/>(5) Any person holding an enquiry under any provision of this Order, under the authority or direction of the Commission shall have the same powers as are vested in the Commission under these Articles.]<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, when judicial or quasi-judicial body makes a decision upon hearing the parties, the High Court Division is competent to examine the legality or propriety of the said decision in the capacity of entertaining a writ of <em>certiorari</em>. So, there is a fundamental difference between an action taken or the decision made by the government or any Constitutional or statutory body and the proceedings initiated or trial commenced by the said bodies; meaning that when any proceeding is pending before any judicial or quasi-judicial body, this Court is usually reluctant to interfere with the said proceedings save in a rare of the rarest case as this Court adheres to the long established age old principle that “<em>a person cannot pursue two parallel remedies in respect of the same matter at the same time</em>” inasmuch as it is the common law policy that when there is an availability of alternative remedy, the jurisdiction of the High Court Division should not be ivoked directly, which has been enshrined in Article 102(2)(a) of our Constitution in the following words: “If satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy provided by law”. Some celebrated cases may be referred to augment our foregoing view.<br/> <br/>In the case of Kunda S Kadam vs K K Soman AIR (1980) SC 881, an in-service employee of Bombay Municipal Corporation applied for the post of Corporation with the recommendation of the Public-Service Commission. While the name was under consideration by the Bombay Municipal Corporation for appointment a writ petition was filed by respondent nos. 1 and 2 challenging the recommendation itself on the ground that the applicant did not fulfill the required statutory qualifications. Bombay High Court took the view that the applicant did not possess one of the qualifications required for appointment and quashed the recommendation. Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court”. In the case of Srivastava KK vs Bhupendra Kumar Jain, (1977) 2 SCC 494, validity of the election of Madhya Pradesh Bar Council was challenged before the Election Tribunal. During pendency of the trial the petitioner approached the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution and obtained an order. Supreme Court set aside the decision with the observation, inter alia, that when election petition covering the same subject-matter was actually pending, the High Court should not have entertained the petition. The Supreme Court described the interference as miss-exercise of the power of judicial review. In the case of Sree Ramdas Motor Transport Ltd. vs Tadi Adhinarayana, (1997) 5 SCC 446, a petition under sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement of the company affairs was filed in the Company Law Board. During pendency of the application a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was filed seeking direction to the Central Government to investigate into the allegations against management by the CBI. High Court issued direction as prayed for. Supreme Court set aside the direction and observed that where statutory remedies were available and the matter was pending the High Court ought not to have passed the order. In the State of Punjab vs Punjab Fibres Ltd. (2005) 1 SCC 604, an assessee challenged the assessment before the Sales Tax Tribunal and the appeal was pending. During pendency of the appeal the assessee filed petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. Supreme Court held that the petition would not lie.<br/> <br/>In our jurisdiction as well, in a series of decisions our Apex disapproved invocation of writ jurisdiction by circumventing the alternative forum. In a recent case, ACC Vs Enayetur Rahman, 64 DLR (AD) 14, when the ACC filed charge-sheet against the petitioner he invoked the writ jurisdiction for quashing the criminal proceedings and the High Court Division quashed the proceeding but the Appellate Division set aside the verdict on the ground that the High Court Division should not have entertained the writ petition when there is an alternative forum.<br/> <br/>It appears that the petitioner has invoked the ‘Special Original Jurisdiction’ of this Court, apparently, under Article 102(2)(a)(ii) of our Constitution. Jurisdiction under Article 102(2), as a whole, is known as an extraordinary jurisdiction and the same is to be availed of only when there is ‘no other equally efficacious remedy’ available.  The framers of the Constitution have intended that the people, at first, must search for and approach an appropriate legal forum other than the Constitutional Court. It is only then the Constitutional Court should be availed of when the citizen will find that the state has not created any legal forum for them for vindication of their right and get the aspired remedy. Thereafter, subject to the ‘satisfaction’ of this Court, a writ petition may be entertained. Article 102(2) of our Constitution may be quoted in this context. ‘The High Court Division <u>may</u>, if <u>satisfied</u> that no other equally efficacious remedy is provided in law......’. It appears from the words employed in the said Article that ‘if satisfied’ strongly suggests that this ‘Special original jurisdiction’ of the High Court Division may be invoked only upon the <u>satisfaction</u> of the High Court Division as to the non-availability of the ‘other equally efficacious remedy’ (underlined for emphasize). In our view, the scrutiny as to the competency of invoking this ‘Special original jurisdiction’ is required to be made by this Court <u>before</u> issuance of any Rule, not <u>by issuing</u> of any Rule in view of the clear and unambiguous words of our Constitution ‘if satisfied’.<br/> <br/>On top of it, there are classifications in the alternative forum. Some forums are administrative appellate forum created by the ordinary statutory provisions and some forums are created under the mandatory of the Constitution such as the Election Commission.  The bottom line is that the High Court Division has always been reluctant to interfere with the functions of any Constitutional body unless the said Constitutional body transgresses its power and acts beyond its jurisdiction. In these cases at hand, the Election Commission being a Constitutional body has issued the impugned notices under the power entrusted upon it by article 91E, which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 91E </strong><sup>205</sup>[91E. (1) <u>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Order or rules</u>, if it appears to the Commission on receiving an information from any source or written report that, any contesting candidate or his agent or any other person on his behalf, by his order or under his direct or indirect consent, engages or attempts to engage in any serious illegal activity or violates or attempts to violate any provision of this Order or rules or Code of Conduct for which he may be disqualified to be elected as a member <u>the Commission may pass an order for an investigation</u> of the matter giving the contesting candidate a reasonable opportunity of being heard.<br/>(2) <u>After receiving the investigation report under clause (1),</u> if the Commission is satisfied that, the report was true, <u>the Commission may, by a written order, cancel the candidature of such candidate</u> and in that event the election shall be held among the other contesting candidates of the concerned constituency; and <u>where only one person remains as a contesting candidate because of cancellation of candidature of the other contesting candidate, election shall be held under Article 17 for that constituency.</u><br/>(3) Any order made under clause (2) shall be sent to the concerned candidate or his election agent by hand or by fax or by e-mail or by courier service or by any other possible means.<br/>(4) The order made under clause (2) shall immediately be sent to the Returning Officer, Presiding Officer and other contesting candidates and the political party that has nominated such candidate.<br/>(5) The order made under clause (2) shall be notified in the Official Gazette and in any other manner which the commission thinks fit.]<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">From a plain reading of article 91E it appears that the above provisions ousts the previous statements of the different provisions of the RPO as it ushers with the words “<em>notwithstanding contained in this Order or rules</em>”. Thus, one may take and interpret this article to be a special power of the Election Commission.<br/> <br/>Thus, the Election Commission apparently has invoked the power given to it by article 91E and if there is a wrong assumption of power by the Election Commission, it also may be agitated by the petitioners before the Election Commission.<br/> <br/>When this Court issues any show cause notice/Rule, be it wrongly, it is the usual practice of our Appellate Division not to interfere with it but to give direction upon the High Court Division to dispose of the same and, thus, Election Commission as a Constitutional body when performs its function within its quasi-judicial jurisdiction under article 91D of the RPO and issues any notice, the correctness or wrongness of issuance of the same may also be adjudicated upon by it. The submissions of Mr. Siddique as to incompetency of the Election Commission to interpret some provisions of the RPO appear to us to be irrelevant given that the Election Commission is not required to interprete any provisions of the RPO, rather the said body in performing its functions in the capacity of a quasi-judicial body would seek to apply the relevant provisions of the RPO construing the ordinary meaning thereof and, thereafter, to relate those provisions to the facts of these cases.<br/> <br/>From our concurrent reading of Article 119 of our Constitution in tandem with articles 12(1)(D), 17, 19, 39, 81, 91A, 91B, 91D, 91E of RPO and Rule 2(6) of নির্বাচন কমিশন আচরণ বিধিমালা, ২০০৮ it appears that the Election Commission is amply empowered to take cognizance of any allegation brought by any person, including a candidate, an agent and the persons who are employed for conducting the election, and, thereby, take necessary action against any candidate during the time of election, including ordering for repoll. The Constitution contemplates a free and fair election and vests comprehensive responsibilities of superintendence, direction and control of the conduct of elections in the Election Commission. This responsibility may cover powers, duties and functions of many sorts, administrative or other depending on the circumstances.<br/> <br/>Thus, in view of the fact that the Election Commission has already initiated a proceeding, be it within the scope of RPO or under the misconception of any provisions of the said law, and since the petitioners already have explained their position before them and, further, before issuance of this writ petitions the Election Commission was in seisin of the matter, this Court is of the opinion that the Election Commission is in a convenient position to adjudicate upon the allegation brought against the petitioners. Accordingly, we are led to hold that these writ petitions are pre-nature as the impugned notices are being awaited to be disposed of by an apparently competent quasi-judicial body upon the hearing of the parties. <br/> <br/>Should, now, this Court take up the other issues, including the legality of the impugned notices, for examination as it has already held that the writ petitions are pre-mature.<br/> <br/>Usually, this Court does not fancy to embark upon dealing with factual issues of a case, where the question of maintainability is an issue for adjudication as in the event of discharging the Rule on the count of maintainability, the examination of other points or factual issues become redundant. However, for the sake of expeditious disposal of the matters pending before the Election Commission and for the convenience of the parties of these cases, we wish to discuss the annexures-A, B &amp; C to both the writ petitions alongside the powers given to the Election Commission for publication of the result or withholding the same in tandem with its power to arrest the persons accused for committing offences under the RPO or the Code of Conducts, 2008 during poll time and also the powers to inquire into the allegations brought against any candidate or any other person and thereafter penalize the culprits by carrying out the scrutiny of the actions of the Election Commission, Returning Officer and the Electoral Enquiry Committee. However, in carrying out the above exercise, this Court would not delve into deciding the issue as to whether the actions of the Election Commission was legal or illegal and if we inadvertently fail to resist our temptation of expressing our views, it should be ignored.  <br/> <br/>We may first take up the public notices circulated by the Returning Officers on 13.12.12 for Mr. Sheik Afiluddin and on 06.01.2014 for Mr. Monirul Islam under articles 19(1) &amp; 39(1) of the RPO respectively (annexure-A to both the writ petitions). From the chronology of events and facts, as stated in the writ petition no. 328 of 2014, it appears that Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin was declared to be the Returned Candidate on 13.12.2013 by the Returning Officer vide circulation of the public notice under his seal and signature under article 19(1) of the RPO as there was no contesting candidate for the said constituency. Thereafter, the Returning Officer also performed his duty under article 19(2) by sending the ‘return’ of the election for Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin’s constituency and while, as per the provisions of article 19(3) of the RPO, respondent no. 1, though was supposed to publish the Gazette Notification, it decided not to publish his name and, instead, initiated proceedings against him which prompted Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin to approach this Court. We may profitably relate the above facts by looking at the provisions of article 19 of the RPO, which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 19 </strong>(1) Where, after scrutiny under Article 14, only one person remains as a validly nominated candidate for election as a member from a constituency or where after withdrawal under Article 16 only one person is left as a contesting candidate, the Returning Officer shall, by public notice, declare such candidate to be elected to the seat:<br/>provided that if after scrutiny any candidate indicates that he intends to make an appeal under clause (5) of Article 14 against the rejection of his nomination paper, no person shall be declared elected uncontested until the period prescribed for filling such appeal has expired and no such appeal has been filed or, where an appeal is filed, until the disposal of such appeal.<br/>(2) The Returning Officer shall submit to the Commission a return of the election in respect of which he has made a declaration under clause(1).<br/>(3) The Commission shall publish in the official Gazette the name of the returned candidate.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">From a plain reading of article 19(1) in tandem with 19(2) &amp; 19(3), it appears that the law is silent about the time period for publication of the Gazette Notification of a candidate who has been declared elected as an uncontested candidate. It is the understanding of this Court from a concurrent reading of the clauses 1, 2 &amp; 3 of article 19 of the RPO that the Election Commission after receiving return of the election from the Returning Officers under article 19(2) of the RPO should publish the Gazette Notification of the Returned Candidates at its earliest convenience given that taking the advantage of absence of the provisions in between clauses 1, 2 &amp; 3 of article 19 as to any time period for publication of the Gazette Notification of the Returned Candidates, respondent no. 1 cannot make unreasonable delay in publication of the Gazette Notification. However, it would not be an unreasonable delay if the names of the uncontested candidates are published in the Gazette Notification together with all other candidates, be contested or uncontested candidates, at one time after holding the National Election in view of the fact that the said practice has been followed by the Election Commission of our country since its inception. It is not the case of Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin (the petitioner in writ petition no. 328 of 2014) that before holding the Parliamentary Election on 05.01.2014 the name of another uncontested candidate of other constituency, after being declared as Returned Candidate by the Returning Officer, was published in the Gazette Notification but his name was not published. So, had his name been published with the names of other candidates on 08.02.2014 in the Gazette Notification there would have been no unreasonable delay or violation of any provisions of the RPO or discrimination against Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin by the Election Commission. As the Election Commission refrained from publication of Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin’s name in the Gazette Notification, he is now before this Court with a complaint of violation of article 19(3) of the RPO against the Election Commission. We now resist ourselves from expressing our mind as to whether there has been any violation of the provisions laid down in article 19(3) of the RPO by the Election Commission by not publication of the Gazette Notification for Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin.<br/> <br/>On the other hand, from the stated facts of writ petition no. 329 of 2014, it appears that Mr. Monirul Islam was declared as the Returned Candidate for the constituency no. 86, Jessore-2 by the Returning Officer on 06.01.2014 under article 39(1) of the RPO after the election was contested with respondent no. 2 and there was no allegation of vote rigging, corrupt practice or capturing any polling station or polling booth on the poll date on 05.01.2014. The alleged offence of connivance or conspiracy to have been committed by Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin was taken place on  30.12.2014 and, thus, not on the poll date on 05.01.2014 and, further, the said allegation is not against Mr. Monirul Islam and the Electoral Enquiry Committee also did not find anything against Mr. Monirul Islam. So, given the above scenario it is to see whether respondent no. 1 was empowered to withhold the publication of Mr. Monirul Islam’s name in the Gazette Notification. In order to deal with the scenario, let us look at the provisions of article 39 of the RPO, which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 39 </strong>(1) The Returning Officer shall, after obtaining the result of the count under Article 37 or of the drawal of the lot under Article 38, declare by public notice the contesting candidate who has or is deemed to have received the highest number of votes to be elected.<br/>(2) The public notice shall contain the name of, and the total number of votes received by, each contesting candidate as a result of consolidation under Article 37 or drawal of lot under Article 38.<br/>(3) The Returning Officer shall, immediately after publication of the notice under clause (1), submit to the Commission a return of the election in the prescribed form together with a copy of the consolidated statement.<br/>(4) The Commission shall publish in the official Gazette the name of the returned candidate.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">From the perusal of clauses 1-4 of article 39 and clauses 1-3 of article 19 of the RPO, it is the understanding of this Court that, in the absence of any negative findings against Mr. Monirul Islam by the Electoral Enquiry Committee, as soon as the General Election was held and the Returning Officer declared his name as the Returned Candidate by circulation of the public notice on 06.01.2014 under article 39(1) of the RPO, the Election Commission was duty bound to publish his name in the Gazette Notification dated 08.01.2014 along with the names of other Returned Candidates throughout the country both under article 39(1) and under article 19(1) of the RPO. However, the above observation is not to be taken as this Court’s conclusionary view on the interpretation of the articles 19 &amp; 39 of the RPO as we refrain from taking any views on the action of respondent no. 1 for now.<br/> <br/>Let us now deal with annexure-B to both the writ petitions by which the Election Commission brought accusations of committing offence under article 81(1)(f) of the RPO against both the petitioners and, thereby, initiated proceedings against them under article 91E of the RPO aiming at cancellation of the polls under article 12(1)(D) of the RPO consequenting a repoll under Article 17 of the RPO. Let us look at the provisions of the above mentioned article 81(1)(f) of the RPO, which is as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">“Except as provided in clause (2) <u>a person is guilty of an offence</u> punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall not be less than three years, and also with fine, <u>if he-</u><br/>(a)................................<br/>(b).................................<br/>(c).................................<br/>(d)................................<br/>(e)................................<br/>(f) In the furtherance of the prospect of the election of a contesting candidate or to subvert election, <u>captures</u>, or <u>abets or connives at, the capturing of, a polling station </u>or polling booth-” (underlined by us)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a plain reading of the said article it appears that if any one commits the offence of capturing, or abetting or conniving of capturing the polling station or polling booth either to favour any of the candidates or undermines the election, the said person may be imprisoned for a term of 7 (seven) years and the minimum period of which may be 3(three) years. Then, the next question becomes pertinent to examine as to whether the petitioners have already been found ‘guilty of the aforesaid offence’, the words employed in article 81(1) (f). Here, the purpose of the use of the word “guilty” is to be minutely examined as the legislature consciously avoided the use of the word “accused”.<br/> <br/>In order to carry out the said scrutiny, let us look at the provisions of Articles 12(1)(d), 17, 91D &amp; 91E. Among the said articles, 91E has already been quoted hereinbefore and from the concurrent reading of the clauses 1-5 of this article, it appears that the said clauses, as a whole, seek to provide us an understanding that the provisions of this article is meant and, thereby, applicable for pre-election offences or occurrences. Now, the question is whether the alleged offence of conniving to capture the polling station with the aid of 100 workers by Mr. Sheikh Afiluddin took place during pre-election period or post election period. If it is taken that the election of Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin has been completed on 13.12.2013 and his result ought to have been published in Gazette Notification before 30.12.2013, no question would have arisen for the Election Commission to issue annexure-B towards cancellation of his ‘candidature’, rather the Election Commission’s proceedings would have been aimed at making him disqualified to remain as an MP as the occurrence would have been treated to be one acquiring a disqualification after becoming an MP. Given the above scenario of the writ petition no. 328 of 2014, we find a two-fold situation for the said writ petitioner Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin; the first situation is, since by operation of rule 2(6) of the Code of Conduct of 2008 Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin’s activities during pre-poll period are regulated by the provisions of the said Code and the said ‘pre-poll period’ being the time period from the date of announcement of the schedule till publication of the Gazette Notification under article 39(4) and his name being not published in the Gazette Notification on 08.01.2014, therefore, the alleged connivance for capturing the polling stations by employing 100 workers might attrack the provisions of article 81(1)(f) of the RPO. The second situation is; since Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin’s result was declared by the Returning Officer under article 19(1) and the Election Commission was duty bound to publish the result under article 19(3) where the word “shall” has been used, therefore, provisions laid down in a delegated legislation such as Code of Conduct, 2008, which has been framed under the authority of the RPO, cannot override the provisions of the RPO so as to catch the petitioner’s all activities took place after 13.12.3013 until publication of the Gazette Notification as the conducts of <strong>নির্বাচন পূর্ববর্তী সময়</strong> as defined in Code no. 2(6) of the Code of Conducts, 2008. On the other hand, to level accusation against Mr. Monirul Islam that he is guilty of the offence under 81(1)(f), the Election Commission have to show his involvement or abatement in capturing the polling station, which apparently is not available in the findings of the Electoral Enquiry Committee’s report.<br/> <br/>Let us now look at the provisions of article 17 of the RPO, which is as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 17 </strong>(1) If a validly nominated candidate who has not withdrawn his candidature dies, <sup>61</sup> [or <u>if his candidature is cancelled under clause (2) of Article 91E,]</u> the Returning officer shall, by public notice, terminate the proceedings relating to that election.<br/>(2) Where proceedings relating to an election have been terminated under clause (1), fresh proceedings shall be commenced in accordance with the provisions of this Order as if for a new election <sup>62</sup> [:Provided that it shall not be necessary for the other contesting candidates to file fresh nomination papers or make a further deposit under Article 13.]</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Article 17 read with article 91E (2) of the RPO contemplate provisions for either to conduct election with at least 2 candidates or after cancellation of the candidature of an accused under article 81(1)(f) of the RPO to postpone the election where only one candidate remains in the aforesaid process. It has not been made clear to this Court by the learned advocate of the Election Commission as to why it did not decide to withhold the election of constituency no. 86 Jessor-2 when the Electoral Enquiry Committee found the veracity of the offence of connivance to capture the poll centres inasmuch as upon carrying out the investigation at that stage if the candidature of Mr. Monirul Islam would have been cancelled, there would have been a new schedule for the election of the Jessore-2 Constituency and, on the other hand, if he would have been found not guilty’ without any consequence to his candidature, the Election Commission could have proceed for election with Mr. Monirul Islam and respondent no. 2 within a few days of the disposal of the complaint. However, article 17 hardly comes into play for the case of Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin as his election, apparently, had been completed well before the occurrence under article 81(1)(f) of the RPO. <br/> <br/>Let us look at the provisions of article 12(1)(d) of the RPO, which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 12(1) </strong>Any elector of a constituency may propose or second for election to that constituency, the name of any person qualified to be a member under clause (1) of Article 66 of the Constitution:<br/><u>Provided that a person shall be disqualified for election as or for being, a member, if he-</u><br/>(a)..................<br/>(b)..................<br/>(c) .................<br/>(d) <u>is a person who is convicted of an offence</u> punishable <u>under Article</u> 73, 74, 78, 79, 80, <u>81</u>, 82, 83, 84 and 86 and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years, unless a period of five years has elapsed since the date of his release; (underlined by us)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Our lucid understanding of the reading of article 12 is that unless a person is convicted he shall not be disqualified to (i) be elected as a MP or (ii) to continue as a MP. Now, the question comes up for consideration that if the Election Commission decides to cancel the candidatures of the petitioners, whether they are required to be tried first by the First Class Magistrate under article 89A of the RPO, which runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><strong>Article 89A </strong><u>Notwithstanding anything contained in the</u> <u>Code of Criminal Procedure, </u>1898 (V of 1898), <u>any person</u> for the time being performing any duty in connection with an election, excluding any member of a law enforcing agency, may, <u>if authorized by the Commission</u>, by general or special order, in this behalf-</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><u>exercise the powers of a Magistrate of the first</u> class under the said Code in respect of the offences punishable under <sup>176</sup>[ Article 73(2B), 74(2A), (3), (4), (5), (6),], Article 78, Article 79, Article 80, Article 81(1) and Article 82; and</li><li style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;"><u>take cognizance of any such offence</u> under any of the clauses of sub-section (a) of section 190 of the said Code,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">and <u>shall try any such offence</u> in a summary manner in accordance with the provisions of the said Code relating to summary trials.]</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>From a reading of the above article 89A it appears that, except the members of the law enforcing agency, the officers responsible for conducting the election may be authorized by the Election Commission to take cognizance of the offence alleged in these writ petition and, thereby, conduct the trial of the said offence. Now, the question is whether the cognizance has already been taken and, secondly, whether the election Commission vide the pending proceeding will commence the trial of the offence.     <br/> <br/>Now, the crucial question falls for consideration is that after holding the 10<sup>th</sup> parliamentary election on 05.01.2014 and after the Returning Officer’s declaration under articles 19(1)&amp;39(1), whether Election Commission ought to have published the petitioners’ name in Gazette Notification and, side by side, continue with the proceedings and, in the event that if they are convicted, then the Election Commission would invoke article 66 of the Constitution. Here, the Election Commission opted for not publishing their names in order to cover their actions under Code no. 2(6) of the Code of Conducts, 2008, which is as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘নির্বাচনি-পূর্ব সময়’’ অর্থ জাতীয় সংসদের সাধারণ নির্বাচন কিংবা কোন শূন্য আসনে নির্বাচনের ক্ষেত্রে কমিশন কর্তৃক নির্বাচনি তফসিল ঘোষণার দিন হইতে নির্বাচনের ফলাফল সরকারি গেজেটে প্রকাশের তারিখ পর্যন্ত সময়কাল;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Now, let us look at the enquiry report of the Electoral Enquiry Committee dated 03.01.2014 (annexure B1 to both the writ petitions).<br/> <br/>It is evident from the Column 4 of the said report that the complaint was lodged against Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin, not against Mr. Monirul Islam and Column 5 of the report contains the allegation and the Column 6 in the decision of the Electoral Enquiry Committee, which records in the following comments “আনীত অভিযোগ আকারে আচরণ বিধি লঙ্গনের সত্যতা পাওয়া গেছে’’ and in Column 7 the recommendation of the Committee goes to say as follows; সুপারিশ: শার্সা উপজেলার সীমানা সংলগ্ন জিকরগাছা ও চৌগাছা উপজেলার ভোট কেন্দ্রগুলিতে প্রশাসন ও পুলিশের এতদবিষয়ে নিবীড় পর্যবেক্ষণ ও তদারকি প্রয়োজন।<br/> <br/>In order to relate the above facts with the relevant provisions of RPO, we may look at article 91A of the RPO, which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify;

6c it appears that the Electoral Enquiry Committee is empowered to inquire into any offence under the RPO and upon carrying out the inquiry it can only make recommendation for Election Commission but the Committee does not possess any power to impose any fine or penalise any one. The Election Commission, then, can ask any person to implement the Committee’s recommendation.<br/> <br/>Here, in these cases the Committee’s recommendation for Election Commission was to remain alert on the poll date on 05.01.2014 so that any pre-poll irregularity may be prevented and it is the admitted position that no occurrence took place on the said poll date. From the Electoral Enquiry Committee’s report another two fold situation surfaces. First, there is nothing against Mr. Monirul Islam in the report and, thus, whether the matter should be taken to have already been disposed of with the peaceful completion of the poll in all the centres of Jessore-2 constituency. The second scenario is whether Mr. Sheikh Afil-Uddin’s offence should be tried independent of his own election matter given that he did not commit any offence in connection with the election of Jessore-1 constituency i.e. his own seat’s election. In other words, committing an offence by him may be seen or considered as if it has been committed by a person with the name of Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin, who does not have any nexus with the election of Jessore-1 constituency after 13.12.2013, and if the offence of Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin is considered to have been committed by one ordinary person such as Mr. Sheigh Afil Uddin or X or Y, then the consequence is that he will be imprisoned for 3 years to 7 years without affecting the election result of the said constituency no. Jessore-1 given that the offence is not connected with the election of constituency no. Jessore-1. However, Mr. Sheikh Afil Uddin or X or Y, due to his post-election conviction, may be disqualified to continue to function as an MP.<br/> <br/>Now, a pertinent question comes up for consideration as to whether the power of investigation invested in the Election Commission under article 91E of the RPO can be exercised by the Election Commission after the Electoral Enquiry Committee conducted its inquiry under article 91A of the RPO having adjudicated upon the pre-poll irregularity by making the recommendation recorded hereinbefore. We, again, refrain from examining the said issue of these cases as we have decided not to make any observations or order as to the actions taken or decisions made by the Election Commission in these cases except commenting that incorporation of the definition of ‘<strong>নির্বাচন পূর্ব-সময়</strong>’ in the RPO could strengthen the position of the Election Commission in dealing with these types of incidents.<br/> <br/>Before parting with the judgment, our task may remain incomplete if we do not deal with the submissions made by Mr. Siddique that there is a Constitutional obligation under Article 72(2) and 148 of our Constitution for the petitioners to sit in the parliament within 30 (thirty days) from 08.01.2014. Having heard his submissions with rapt attention and, thereafter, perusing the said Constitutional Provisions, we find it difficult to comprehend his submissions inasmuch as 3 (three) day time limitation for taking oath comes in operation only when the name of an MP is published in the Gazette Notification and, thus, the issue of sitting in the parliament within thirty days appears to be completely irrelevant for these petitioners.<br/> <br/>Since our above exercise was aimed at briefly analyzing the relevant provisions of the Constitution and RPO, which are apparently applicable in disposal of the complaints pending before the Election Commission, therefore, if the Election Commission finds the discussions of the facts alongside the relevant provisions of the RPO as made hereinbefore to be conducive for the disposal of the complaints pending before them, they are at liberty to take the benefits of the discussions and observations made by this Court here in this judgment.<br/> <br/>So, from the above threadbare discussions this Court is left with no option but to hold that the Rules are liable to be disposed of with a direction upon the Election Commission (respondent no. 1) to adjudicate upon the said complaints brought against the petitioners, which are now pending before Election Commission, at its earliest convenience.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, we direct the Election Commission (respondent no. 1) to dispose of the complaints filed by respondent no. 2 with regard to the elections of the constituencies of Jessore-1 and Jessore-2 within 2 (two) weeks from the date of receiving this judgment without fail.<br/> <br/>With the aforesaid observations and directions these Rules are disposed of without any order as to costs.<br/><br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
