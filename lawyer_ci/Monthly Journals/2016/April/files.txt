The writ-petitioner entered into an agreement with the respondent No. 8 Gas Transmission Company Limited, Bangladesh, (GTCL) on 21.10.2011 and by the said contract the respondent No. 8 employed the writ-petitioner as contractor for design, build, plant, installation, construction, testing, commissioning, start up, operation, and maintenance together with ancillary facilities of Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Compressor at Ashugonj in Brahmanbaria and at Elenga in Tangail. The said contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 provides that the plant mandatory spare parts commissioning and operational spare parts special tours, consumable and design are to be imported from the principal office of the writ-petitioner situated in Korea and some other foreign countries by opening letter of credit (LC). The price of those tools equipments and materials are fixed in foreign currencies and for sale and supply of these materials the writ-petitioner company shall receive the payment in Korea in foreign currency. The respondent No. 8 as employer shall paid all duties VAT, Custom Charges, Clearing Charges and all taxes livable on those tools equipments and materials at import stage as a principal in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      It has been further asserted in the writ petition that the writ-petitioner company does not have any permanent ‘establishment in Bangladesh’ within the meaning of Article-5 of the Convention between the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of Korea for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and as such the writ-petitioner company is exempted to be taxed in Bangladesh for its income, profit and earning generated outside territory in Bangladesh therefore in Korea. On its export and supply of tools equipments and materials to the respondent No. 8 for which the writ-petitioner  is liable and is paying taxes as applicable in Korea which includes the corporate tax for its off-shore total income for supplying materials to BCSC project in Bangladesh. The writ-petitioner is an income tax payer in Bangladesh under its TIN 699-200-0165/Circle-222 against its income in Bangladesh and the writ-petitioner is paying Advance Income Tax (AIT) at source @ 5% for the payment receipt for rendering services in Bangladesh from the contract price portion involved the income generated in Bangladesh and accordingly the writ-petitioner has submitted its income tax return for the assessment year 2013-2014. But the writ-petitioner is exempted from paying any money as taxed in Bangladesh under the convention dated 3.10.1984 on the off-shore portion of bill <em>i.e.</em> on the income generated in Korea. But the employer respondent No. 3 GTCL most illegally started deducting Advance Income Tax (AIT) @ 5% at source on the entire bill both on the off-shore income and on shore portion of bills against the constructed works and the respondent No. 8 by four installments on 26.1.2013, 30,4,2013, 31.7.2013 and on 8.10.2013 deducted money as Advance Income Tax (AIT) amounting to Tk. 19,51,56,447.59 from the off-shore portion of bills of the writ-petitioner <em>i.e.</em> income generated from the outside taxable territory of Bangladesh. Prior to such deduction by the respondent No. 8 the writ-petitioner company on 7.1.2013 filed the representation before the respondent No. 2 upon having sank of illegal deduction from their bill prayed for a direction upon the respondent No. 8 GTCL paid a clarification from the National Board of Revenue for non-deduction of Advance Income Tax (AIT) from the bill of the imported materials from the portion of payment involved the importation. But without any response.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      It has been further asserted that there is a convention between the government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the government of Republic of Korea executed and signed on 10.5.1983 which has been notified in the Bangladesh gazette on 3.10.1984 with the object against avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. This convention was made pursuant to the power conferred under the provision of section 144(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and the Government of Bangladesh has given effect to the said convention in Bangladesh and the same is in force in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      It has been asserted further that the said contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 (Annexure-B) is a composite contract but the payment of contract price are divided into two portion <em>i.e.</em> (I) in foreign currency portion for sale and supply of equipments and materials and (II) in local currency portion <em>i.e.</em> in BDT for installation, co and aim services in Bangladesh. It has been asserted that the writ-petitioner has no objection if the respondent No. 8 the employer deducts money @ 5% as Advance Income Tax (AIT) at source for the payments receipt for services rendered/done in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      Having been failed to get any favorable relief from the respondents the writ-petitioner upon service of a notice demanding justice  preferred the instant writ petition and obtained the rule Nisi as aforementioned.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      Upon service of notice of the rule, the respondent No. 6 second secretary (Income Tax Law and Rules National Board of Revenue) entered appearance through the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir and filed affidavit-in-opposition wherein it has been stated that the writ-petitioner is not entitled to get the benefit of taxes exemption as per Convention dated 10.5.1983 executed between the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Peoples Republic of Korea since the writ-petitioner  runs his business in Bangladesh as a permanent establishment. The writ-petitioner is to pay tax as per the income tax law and rules of the Income Tax Rules 1984. The payment of tax by the writ-petitioner in Korea by way of corporate tax or any other tax has no relevance with regard to getting any benefit as per the income tax law and rules 1984 and the double taxation avoidance agreement with Korea. Although the writ-petitioner has filed a representation on 7.1.2013 but as the tax is deductable at source from the bills of the writ-petitioner to be paid by the employer no response to the said letter is required to be made. The importer the Gas Transmission Company Limited Bangladesh (GTCL) Dhaka is bound to deduct tax at source Advance Income Tax (AIT) @ 5% at the time of payment of bill under section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984 for execution of contract work and accordingly the GTCL has deducted tax at source in four installments amounting to Tk. 19,51,56,447.59 both for op-shore and on shore portion of bills against the execution of contract work as per the agreement of the provision of section 62 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984. Therefore, all the actions as have been taken by the GTCL is within the permitted parameter of the income tax law and accordingly the rule nisi as has been issued by this court is required to be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      The respondent No. 8 Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) entered appearance by the learned Advocate Mr. Abu Nashar Azad and filed affidavit-in-opposition on behalf of the respondent No. 8 wherein it has been stated that the respondent No. 8 Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) has entered into a contract with the writ-petitioner (HECL) on 21.10.2011 for the design bill and turnkey supply, installation, construction, testing, commissioning and operation and maintenance of natural gas transmission pipeline compressor station at Ashugonj and Elenga which provides that plant, mandatory spare parts, commissioning and operational spare parts, special tools, consumables etc. are to be imported from the principal office of the writ-petitioner company situated in Korea and some other foreign countries by opening letter of credit and the said parts and permanent materials were imported by means of import permit and not by way of opening letters of credit and the same were imported from approved vendors/manufacturer from Asian Development Bank from allegeable countries as stipulated in the appendix No. 5 of the said contract through the writ-petitioners company.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      It has been further stated that the respondent No. 8 denies that the writ-petitioner company has no temporary or permanent business establishment in Bangladesh and also denies that the Board of Investment (BOI) gave the writ-petitioner company “<em>limited permission……to carry out only the contracted works at Ashugonj in Brahmanbaria and Elenga in Tangail”.</em><br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    As per the Clause No.1 of the Board of Investment (BOI) permission dated 15.3.2012 the writ-petitioner company was permitted to carry on consultancy on engineering procurement and construction service for Ashugonj and Elenga Natural Gas Pipeline and 150MW-CCP Project which covers all the works contracted for under the contract dated 21.10.2011 and therefore the said permission issued by the Board of Investment is not limited by any means.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    The Article No. 5 of the Convention between the Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of Bangladesh dated 10.5.1983 clearly states that the permanent establishment includes a Branch office given that the writ-petitioner company Branch office in Bangladesh which opened with the effect from 29.2.2012 and is still operational in addition to other officers as assembly project side therefore the writ-petitioner company has a permanent establishment in Bangladesh. The writ-petitioner did not file any proof as to their payment of corporate tax to the National Tax service in Republic of Korea for any part of its income under the contract dated 21.10.2011. The Advance Income Tax (AIT) is being deducted from the writ-petitioner companies bill for all works under the contract dated 21.10.2011 in accordance with the provision of section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 read with rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984. Although the respondent No. 8 Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) has paid all customs and import duties VAT and other taxes livid in Bangladesh for the plant of machinery supplied by the writ-petitioner company but the same remained the liability of the writ-petitioner company to be deducted from the bill to be paid to the writ-petitioner at an appropriate period. The materials which have been imported from abroad do not go to the possession of GTCL but remained under the custody of the writ-petitioner company in Bangladesh until all of its obligation under the aforesaid contracts are discharged. All payment either op-shore or on shore made to the writ-petitioner company under the provision of contract dated 21.10.2011 are liable to be subjected to deduct of Advance Income Tax under section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984 and as such the deduction as made are lawful act on the part of the employer GTCL.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    It has been categorically denied in the affidavit-in-opposition that the GTCL imported plant and other parts by means of import permit and not by way of opening letter of credit, the four letter of credit mentioned in paragraph No. 14 of the writ petition were opened by the GTCL for effecting payment to be made to the writ-petitioner company for the works to be rendered under the contract. The notice demanding justice as served by the writ-petitioner does not call for any response as the point which has been raised in the said demanding justice notice is not lawful. The GTCL deducted 5% Advance Income Tax and deposited to the same to the Government ex-chaquer from every payment it made to the writ-petitioner company for works done by the writ-petitioner company under the contract dated 21.10.2011 including the payment for supply of plants tools etc. pursuant to the provision of section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984 which was agreed by the writ-petitioner company in the contract.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>    During the progress of hearing of the rule nisi a number of pleading have been exchanged by the parties by way of supplementary affidavit and replied to the supplementary affidavit wherein the facts that have been asserted in the writ petition and the affidavit-in-opposition has been reiterated.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam along with the learned Advocate Mr. Bakir Uddin Bhuiyan appeared on behalf of the writ-petitioner while the learned senior counsel Mr. F. Hasan Arif along with the learned Advocate Mr. Abu Nashar Azad appeared on behalf of the respondent No. 8 and while the learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir argued on behalf of the National Board of Revenue at the time of hearing of the rule.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamalu-ul-Alam, appearing on behalf of the writ-petitioner at the very outset has taken this court through the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 and the gazette  notification of the convention between the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and People’s Republic of Korea for the avoidance of Double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income as annexed with the writ-petition and strenuously argued that the writ-petitioner and the respondent No. 8 Gas Transmission of Company Limited (GTCL) entered into an agreement for the design build, installation, construction, testing, commissioning and operation and maintenance of natural gas transmission pipeline compressors station at Ashugonj and Elenga and although the said contract is a composite contract and the writ-petitioner company would supply the plant, equipments and the contracted materials along with the installation, operation and maintenance in Bangladesh of the said gas compressor  station in two places in Bangladesh yet the two parts of the contract are distinct and devisable and one part is not dependable on the other and as such the supply of materials has nothing to do with the rendering of the installation operation and maintenance service to Gas Transmission and Company Limited (GTCL).<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong>    In elaborating his argument the learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam referred the particular portion of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 <em>i.e.</em> 2.2 and 2.1 and further strenuously argued that the terms of payment categorically established the fact that the agreement for supply of permanent equipments has got distinct identity from the job of installation, operation &amp; maintenance  and commissioning of the said permanent equipments at two gas stations in Bangladesh. The writ-petitioner company herein acted in two aspects one being the supplier/seller of the tools equipments and materials to the respondent No. 8 and on other hand acting as a employee under the employer GTCL so far the installation, operation &amp; maintenance and commissioning of the said equipments are concerned.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam vigorously argued that the tools, equipments and materials have been imported by the employer GTCL respondent No. 8 on their own instance by opening Letters of Credit from the writ-petitioner company in Korea and also from different countries through the writ-petitioner company pursuant to the provision of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 and upon releasing the said tools, equipments and materials the employer GTCL paid the all required taxes and duties at the Chittagong Port including Advance Income Tax (AIT) @ 5%. That being their responsibility in their shoulder under the provision of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 the same cannot be transferred to the shoulder of the writ-petitioner company by way of deducting the same from the bills to be paid to the writ-petitioner company for the job done apart the job involving the installation, commissioning of the gas compressors station at Ashugonj and at Elenga.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    The leaned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam further argued that the Clause 14 of the General Conditions of Contract deals with the provisions of payment of Taxes and Duties under the contract and in Clause 14.3 it has been stipulated that if any tax deduction, reductions, allowances and privileges may be available to the Contractor in the country where the site is located, the Employer shall use its best endeavors to enable the Contractor to benefit from any such tax savings to the maximum allowable extent which indicates that the petitioner is exempted to pay AIT @5% on its foreign portion of bills under the provision of the Convention between the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of Korea for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income dated 10.5.1983 circulated vide Notification dated 02.10.1984 published by the Internal Resources Division of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in the Bangladesh Gazette on 03.10.1984 (Annexure-D) to the writ petition)<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam emphasized on the point that the writ-petitioner being the supplier and seller of the materials, equipments and tools in Korea earned the income therein as it received the consideration money for those materials tools and equipments in Korea and their responsibility ended so far the supply is concerned subject to the provision of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011  up to the delivery of those equipments tools and materials on board in Korea Ocean Port. But although different other tools, equipments and materials were imported from different countries other than the Korea the same has been imported on the liability and responsibility of the employer company GTCL.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam by referring in Clause No. 14.1 of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 drawn the attention of this court to the fact that the liability of the taxes and duties on the import of permanent materials/goods has been imposed on the shoulder of the employer company GTCL the respondent No. 8 and any payment of tax including the Advance Income Tax (AIT) shall be borne by the GTCL which they have already borne while releasing the permanent materials/goods from the Chittagong Port and the liability of which cannot be transferred to the shoulder of the writ-petitioner company as the same has not permitted in Clause No. 14.1 of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam further drawn the attention of this court to the fact that the GTCL while paying the bill to the writ-petitioner company illegally deducted Advance Income Tax (AIT) @ 5% as appears from Annexure-J series which not being a lawful act on the part of the employer company GTCL the respondent No. 8 is required to be refunded to the writ-petitioner company.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam while taken this court through the provision of the Convention between the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and People’s Republic in Korea for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income Annexure-G vigorously argued that the writ-petitioner company has no permanent establishment in Bangladesh and upon obtaining a permission from the Board of Investment (BOI) the writ-petitioner has opened a branch office in Bangladesh only to gather information and to onward supply the same to its Korean Head Office only to the installation and commissioning of the gas compressors station in Ashugonj and in Elenga with a categorical permission not to enter into any other business in Bangladesh and accordingly the branch office in Bangladesh is performing its duty pursuant to the permission accorded by the Board of Investment (BOI) which comes under the purview of the provision of Article-8 of the Convention wherein a branch office with such nature has been defined as not to be a permanent establishment.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam further argued that under the Convention Article-7 the income of the writ-petitioner company accrued in Korea cannot be taxed in Bangladesh since the writ-petitioner company will be taxes in Korea and actually have been taxed therein as appears from the certificate issued by the National Tax Service as annexed with the writ petition and therefore the deduction of 5% from the payment of the foreign currency portion is a palpable illegality committed by the employer GTCL, the respondent No. 8.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam categorically argued that the statement made in the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No. 6 as to liability of the GTCL the respondent No. 8 to deduct the Advance Income Tax (AIT) under the provision of section 52 from the bills of the writ-petitioner company not being made in accordance with law the same is required to be adjudicated by this court by making the rule absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    The learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam referred the case of Dhaka Power House &amp; another-Vs-Assistant Collector of Customs and others reported in 11 BLD (AD) 327, in the case of Bangladesh Telecom (Pvt) Ltd.-Vs- Bangladesh Telegraph &amp; Telephone Board and other reported in 48 DLR(AD)20, in the case of Hyundai Corporation -Vs- Deputy Commissioner of Taxes and another reported in 51 DLR 333, in the case India Thermit Corporation Limited-Vs-The Commissioner of Taxes reported in 6 BLC 536, in the case of M/S. Commitment International and others-Vs-Government of Bangladesh and others reported in 1 CLR 65 and judgment passed on 10.1.2013 in the case of Standard Chartered Bank -Vs- The Commissioner of Taxes (unreported).<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong>    On the other hand the learned senior counsel Mr. F. Hasan Arif appearing on behalf of the writ-petitioner Gas Transmission Company Limited Bangladesh (GTCL) at the very outset drawn the attention of this court to the fact that the GTCL being the employer entered into an agreement with the writ-petitioner company Hyundai Engineering Company Limited (HECL) for the purpose of design bill and turnkey supply, installation, construction, testing, commissioning and operation and maintenance of natural gas transmission pipeline compressor station at Ashugonj and at Elenga and the said agreement is a composite agreement meaning thereby not to be devisable into parts as have been claimed by the writ-petitioner the entire responsibility of commissioning of the said gas compressor station and to maintain the same for 730 (seven hundred thirty) days lies on the shoulder of the writ-petitioner company and as such the imports of the permanent materials by the employer GTCL the respondent No. 8 cannot be treated as a responsibility lies on the shoulder of the employer GTCL since the entire work being on turnkey basis shall be performed by the writ-petitioner company and as a matter of convenience the GTCL has landed its co-operation in importing those machineries, tools and equipments which after release from the Chittagong Port now remaining the custody of the writ-petitioner company which clearly shows that the entire installation has to be performed under a turnkey basis.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong>    The learned senior counsel Mr. F. Hasan Arif while taken this court through the provision of Clause No. 14.1 of the Special Condition of Contract (SCC) drawn the attention of this court to the provision of that the employer shall deduct the taxes including withholding tax and VAT from the total contract price (all currencies) as per the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) rules and prescribed rates imposed by National Board of Revenue (NBR) from time to time and shall deposit the same to the GOB in the credit of the contractor. Accordingly the employer GTCL has although paid the AIT @ 5% at the time of releasing the permanent materials but the same always remained as the liability of the contractor the writ-petitioner company which is required to be deducted from the bill to be paid to the writ-petitioner company and accordingly the employer GTCL the respondent No. 8 has deducted the said 5% AIT amount from the bill of the writ-petitioner company.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong>    The learned senior counsel Mr. F. Hasan Arif argued that the GTCL has acted as a collecting authority under the provision of section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984 as the law has imposed the liability upon the GTCL as the GTCL is required to pay the bill to the writ-petitioner company and the law has not divided any payment as to the foreign part or as to the local part rather any bill to be paid to the contractor a amount of 5% AIT is to be deducted from the said bill and in order to discharge the liability under the statute the GTCL has deducted the same from the bill to be paid to the writ-petitioner company.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong>    The learned senior counsel Mr. F. Hasan Arif argued that the payment made under the aforesaid contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 cannot be classified as op-shore and on shore payment as all the works done under the contracts are all collected to and dependent upon one another making the contract one true composite contract with one obligation at union of meaning.   <br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong>    The learned senior counsel Mr. F. Hasan Arif raised a very serious question as to the maintainability of this writ petition company on the ground that the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 contends a Clause for Arbitration of dispute and since the writ-petitioner company has raised the dispute under the provision of contract the same is required to be referred to the Arbitrator instead of filing a writ petition before this court as a long light of decision has established the fact when the contract agreement contends a clause for Arbitration and as such the the writ-petitioner company filed by the instant writ petition is not maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>31.    </strong>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir, appearing on behalf of the National Board of Revenue while adopting all the argument as has been advanced by the learned senior counsel Mr. F. Hasan Arif argued that the statutory provision as has been embodied in section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984 requires the employer GTCL the respondent No. 8 to deduct 5% Advance Income Tax (AIT) from the bill to be paid to the contractor and the law has not made any distinction in between any payment for the purpose of importing any materials from out side or to installation , commissioning of that material within the periphery of Bangladesh rather the employer will be liable to penalty for the default in not  deducting the Advance Income Tax (AIT) from the bill to be paid to the contractor.<br/> <br/><strong>32.    </strong>The learned Deputy Attorney General Mr. S. Rashed Jahangir further argued that the GTCL the respondent No. 8 being the employer is liable to perform the duties as has been imposed by the provision of section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 read with rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984 to deduct 5% AIT from the bill to be paid to the writ-petitioner company for the job to be done in respect of installation and commissioning of the Gas Compressors Station at two places in Bangladesh and since they have acted in accordance with the law and paid the deducted taxes to the ex-chequer the same cannot be challenged under this writ petition as a illegal and unlawful act of the employer GTCL the respondent No. 8 and therefore the instant rule nisi is required to be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong>    In reply to the argument as to the maintainability of this writ petition the learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam strenuously argued that the question of deduction of 5% AIT being a question of law cannot be considered disposed off by way of Arbitration and that being connected with the provision of constitution a Arbitrator will be unable to dispose off the dispute as has been raised in the instant writ petition as to the liability of deduction of 5% AIT from the writ-petitioner company which not being a resident company and being under the provision of the convention for avoidance of tax evasion and double taxation and therefore the instant writ petition is squarely maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong>    We have heard the learned Advocates and perused the materials on record, especially the Annexure as to the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 the convention for the avoidance of tax evasion and the double taxation executed in between the Government of Bangladesh and the Republic of Korea and other connected materials as have been appended to the different pleadings filed before this court, we have also considered the valuable arguments as advanced by the learned counsels of the parties.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong>    Admittedly, the writ-petitioner company is a Korean company and admitted the respondent No. 8 Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) entered into a contract agreement on 21.10.2011 for the design built and turnkey supply, installation, construction, testing, commissioning and operation and maintenance of natural gas transmission pipeline compressors stations at Ashugonj and at Elenga.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong>    Admittedly, the writ-petitioner company has a Branch office in Bangladesh the dispute has arisen in between the parties are related to deduction of 5% Advance Income Tax (AIT) from the bill. That has been paid to the writ-petitioner company against which the writ-petitioner company obtained the rule nisi which called on the respondent to show cause as to why the deduction of money @ 5% as Advance Income Tax (AIT) at source from the contract price/bill of the writ-petitioner company against the contract agreement No. GTCL/ CSP/ EPC/002 dated 21.10.2011 (Annexure-B) so per it relates to the transaction took place outside the taxable territory of Bangladesh <em>i.e.</em> in Korea for selling and supplying of the plant mandatory spare parts equipments and other materials to respondent No. 8 in Bangladesh shall not been declared to be without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect meaning thereby that the writ-petitioner company has only challenged the legality and propriety of the deduction of 5% Advance Income Tax (AIT) from the payment as has been made by the employer company GTCL the respondent No. 8 in respect of purchasing and importing the permanent materials/goods imported from outside the employers country for permanent installation.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong>    It appears from Annexure-J series that the employer of GTCL the respondent No. 8 has deducted 5% Advance Income Tax (AIT) from the bills connected to importation of the tools, equipment and materials from abroad which has been admitted in the Annexure-17 in the supplementary affidavit filed by the respondent No. 8 for a better appreciation (Annexure-17) is reproduced below;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Installation of Compressor Station at Ashugonj and Elenga Project.</em><br/><em><u>Statement of adjustment of Tax and VAT deductible from Foreign Currency Payment FY:2011-2012</u></em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>39.</strong>    Being aggrieved with the such deduction of 5% Advance Income Tax (AIT) from the foreign currency part of the payment the writ-petitioner company submitted a representation before the respondent No. 2 Member (Tax Policy National Board of Revenue) on 7.1.2013 in order to appreciate the grievance and the claim of the writ-petitioner company the entire representation being Annexure-G is reproduced here;<br/> <br/>………………………………………………<br/>……………………………………………...<br/>……………………………………………...<br/> </div><ol start="4" style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">that the contract are being executed in Bangladesh and HECL have been carrying out the execution of the contract for installation and other services under GTCL. The materials i.e. plant, mandatory spare parts, commissioning and operational spare parts, special tools, consumables as well as design services forming as one part of the Contract for supply as indicated in Para 1(ii)A are being imported by GTCL from different foreign countries. GTCL by making payment against L/C opened by GTCL have been purchasing these materials &amp; services from the head office of HECL. The materials have become the property of GTCL as soon as they are shipped from different foreign countries. The materials are carried in Bangladesh and to the stores of GTCL as their property. The goods from the ports of despatch from foreign countries to the port of destination in Bangladesh are insured by GTCL and insurance charges are paid by GTCL. Clause 14.1 of the Contract states that customs and import duties, VAT and other taxes, if any, levied by the Employer’s Country at the port of entry on permanent materials/goods imported from outside the Employer’s Country for permanent installation except materials for civil works shall be paid by the Employer. GTCL has made payments of all duties &amp; taxes accordingly. The payments for the materials are being made in South Korea in foreign currency by GTCL to HECL upon clearance from the Customs Authority at the port of destination in Bangladesh, and the ownership and possession of the materials have been passed over to GTCL.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That although the contract work is in one composite contract, it was agreed between HECL and GTCL that HECL will supply the necessary materials i.e. plant, mandatory spare parts, commissioning and operational spare parts, special tools, consumables as well as design services supplied from abroad to GTCL forming as one part of the contract. Installation and other services will be done by HECL in Ashuganj and Elenga forming other part of the contract. Yet the two parts of the contract are distinct and divisible. One is independent of the other. The supply of materials has nothing to do with the rendering of services to the GTCL. Payments received by HECL in Bangladesh to the extent of the portion for execution of the contract only attracts deduction of advance tax under Section 52 of the I. T. Ordinance, 1984 and in the manner as provided under Rule- 16. HECL being a non-resident company, the payments received by it outside taxable territories on the sale of plant, mandatory spare parts, commissioning and operational spare parts, special tools, consumables as well as design services of Bangladesh through export cannot be considered as payments to HECL inviting action for deduction of advance tax under u/s 52 read with Rule -16.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That, besides our foregoings, NBR has referred, while giving decisions, to its office memorandum under নথি নং- ৮(৪০১) দ্বিঃ সঃ-১৭ (কঃ অঃ-২)/৯৮ তারিখ- ১৪/০৮/২০০০ ইং wherein NBR has clarified in a very clear way as reproduced below: </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘আমদানীকারক স্বয়ং উৎসে আয়কর সংগ্রহীত হয়েছে এরূপ আমদানীকৃত পণ্য সরবরাহ করলে ঐ সরবরাহ বিলের উপর উৎসে পুর্নবার আয়কর কর্তনযোগ্য হবে কিনা এ প্রশ্ন বিভিন্ন মহল থেকে উত্থাপিত হয়েছে।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">এমতাবস্থায় জাতীয় রাজস্ব বোর্ড এ মর্মে স্পষ্টীকরণ করেছে যে, আমদানীকারক স্বয়ং আমদানীস্থলে উৎসে আয়কর সংগ্রহীত হয়েছে এরূপ নিদৃষ্ট পণ্য সরবরাহ করলে সরবরাহ স্থলে আয়কর বিধিমালা ১৯৮৪ এর ১৬ বিধি অনুযায়ী উৎসে আয়কর কর্তন করতে হবে না। অর্থাৎ একই ব্যক্তি যদি কোন পণ্য আমদানী করে তা সরবরাহ করেন এবং আমদানী পর্যায়ে যদি উক্ত পণ্যের উপর উৎসে আয়কর কর্তন করা হয়ে থাকে তবে সরবরাহ বিল হতে পুনরায় আয়কর কর্তন করতে হবে না। তবে যে আমদানী মূল্যের উপর আমদানী পর্যায়ে কর কর্তন করা হয়েছে- সরবরাহ মূল্য তার বেশি হলে, ঐ অতিরিক্ত অর্থের উপর সরবরাহ বিল হতে আয়কর কর্তন করতে হবে।’’</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Copy of this memorandum dated 14.08.2000 is furnished for your ready reference and perusal.</div><ol start="7" style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">NBR has expressed the same view vide its office memorandum under নথি নং- ৮(৪১) দ্বিঃ সঃ-১৭ (কঃ অঃ-২)/ ২০০১ তারিখ ৩১/০৫/২০০১ ইং as quoted below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘‘আমদানীকারক স্বয়ং উৎসে আয়কর সংগ্রহীত হয়েছে এরূপ পণ্য Execution of Contract এ ব্যবহার করলে Execution of Contract বাবদ প্রাপ্ত বিলের উপর পুর্নবার আয়কর কর্তনযোগ্য হবে কি-না এ প্রশ্ন বিভিন্ন মহল থেকে উত্থাপিত হয়েছে। <br/>এমতাবস্থায় জাতীয় রাজস্ব বোর্ড এ মর্মে স্পষ্টীকরণ করেছে যে, আমদানীকারক স্বয়ং আমদানী পর্যায়ে উৎসে আয়কর সংগ্রহীত হয়েছে এরূপ নিদৃষ্ট পণ্য চুক্তিবদ্ধ নির্মাণ কাজে (Execution of Contract) ব্যবহার করলে প্রাপ্ত ঠিকাদারী বিল থেকে আমদানীর পর্যায়ে কর্তিত করের সমপরিমাণ টাকা আয়কর অধ্যাদেশ ১৯৮৪ এর বিধি- ১৬ অনুযায়ী কর্তন করতে হবেনা। অর্থাৎ একই ব্যক্তি/ প্রতিষ্ঠান কোন পণ্য আমদানী করে তা চুক্তিবদ্ধ কার্য্য সম্পাদনে (Execution of Contract) ব্যবহার করেন এবং আমদানী পর্যায়ে যদি উক্ত পণ্যের উপর উৎসে আয়কর কর্তন করা হয়ে থাকে তবে বিধি ১৬ অনুযায়ী বিল প্রদানের সময় আমদানী পর্যায়ে কর্তিত করের সমপরিমাণ অংকের কর মোট কর্তনযোগ্য করের সাথে সমন্বয় করা যাবে।’’ </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> Copy of this memorandum dated 31.05.2001 is provided herewith for your ready reference and perusal.</div><ol start="8" style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">That it is evidently clear from both the clarifications as referred to (v) and (vi) above that, in respect of payments on account of supply of imported goods and execution of contract work with the same imported goods on which advance income tax was collected at import stage, no further deduction of AIT u/s 52 read with Rule- 16 is required to be made, which is, however, subject to the condition that tax on such goods shall be liable to be deducted on so much of the value shown in the supply bill which was in excess of the value of the imported goods. </li><li style="text-align:justify">Further we hereby submit that HECL is a non-resident corporation having its Head Office in Seoul, Korea, and was permitted to work in Bangladesh in the year 2011. There is absolutely nothing showing that HECL has a permanent establishment in Bangladesh and HECL are actually doing business here in this country and that HECL itself are selling products to any person in Bangladesh. That HECL has established an office in Dhaka with the object to collect and despatch information for the Head Office at Seoul, Korea, for smooth transactions between Head Office and the importers in Bangladesh and to enable it to participate international tenders and to keep nexus between the two countries so that the business activities of HECL be quick and speedy. If any profit is earned by our principal office in Korea under the convention HECL will be taxed in Korea. But HECL cannot be taxed in Bangladesh for its earnings in Korea which is protected under the convention between the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of Korea prepared and signed for avoiding of double taxation and also for prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income which has the backing of Section 144 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 and which is a solemn document entered into between these two Governments.</li><li style="text-align:justify">That plant, mandatory spare parts, commissioning and operational spare parts, special tools, consumables and design services as shown in 1(ii)A above have been sold to GTCL from Korea by HECL, and all duties, taxes and other levies are being paid at the point of custom clearance of the goods/materials at Chittagong and Dhaka by GTCL as importers. The materials are in possession and stored by GTCL and issued to HECL in Bangladesh for execution of the contract as shown in 1.B above. It signifies that GTCL has engaged HECL in Bangladesh for execution of the contract with the supplied materials imported, owned and stored by GTCL. Hence, AIT may be applicable for the portion of work for execution of the contract only.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, a clarification by NBR may be issued for non-deduction of AIT paid by GTCL for the imported materials from the portion of payments for execution of the contract bills by HECL and oblige.<br/>With Regards<br/>…………………………..<br/>Ki Hun Yeom<br/>Enclosures: As stated above.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>39.</strong>    In the aforesaid representation the writ-petitioner company has raised three fault claim; (I) that the job classified under the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 can be divided into two parts (i) for the importation of the permanent materials (ii) the installation and commissioning of those permanent materials, (II) that the liability of payment of taxes including AIT lies on the shoulder of the employer GTCL so per the same is related to the importation of the permanent materials and (III) that the writ-petitioner company being a non-resident entity in Bangladesh having no permanent establishment in Bangladesh cannot be taxed in Bangladesh under the provision of the convention as aforesaid since the tax has been imposed on them in Korea.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong>    Upon such claim the writ-petitioner company obtained the instant rule nisi as aforementioned.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong>    But as the maintainability of the writ petition goes to the route of the question we like to decide the same at the first. The question of deducting Advance Income Tax is a question of law. Section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 rendered a liability upon the employer of a contract to deduct Advance Income Tax (AIT) at source from the bill to be paid to the contractor. Rule 16 of the Income Tax Rules 1984 provided the percentage of deduction at 5% Advance Income Tax (AIT). The provision of section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 runs as follows;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong><em><u>Income Tax Ordinance 1984 </u></em></strong><br/><strong><em><u>Section 52:</u></em></strong><strong><em> Deduction from payment to contractors, etc.—</em></strong><br/><br/><em>1. Where any payment is to be made, whether in full or in part, or by way of advance, on account of indenting commission [or travel agency commission] or shipping agency commission or supply of goods or [execution of contract or sub-contract][or for services rendered], to any such person or class of persons as may be prescribed, the person responsible for making the payment shall, at the time of making such payment deduct tax on the amount so payable at such rate as may be prescribed.<br/><br/><em>2. Any amount deducted under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be an advance payment of tax by the payee and shall be given credit for in the assessment of his tax. </em></em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>42.</strong>    The liability of such deduction apparently lies on the shoulder of the employer GTCL. But the writ-petitioner company has raised a question as to the interpretation of the convention Annexure-D made in between the People’s Republic in Bangladesh and the People’s Republic in Korea for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes or income with claim that the Branch office which has been opened by the writ-petitioner company in Bangladesh under the permission of the Board of Investment (BOI) comes under the exclusion clause as have been made in Article-5 of the said convention. Both of which being a question of law cannot be decided by the Arbitration. Although the liability of payment of tax is a matter covered by the contract agreement yet the nature of the dispute does not attract the provision of Arbitration as has been stipulated in the contract agreement itself and therefore the instant writ petition is maintainable.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>    This argument sounds merit.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong>    A question which is a pure question of law connected with the interpretation of the provision of constitution cannot be raised consider or disposed off by any Arbitrator. The provision of the constitution or any law can only be interpreted by this Highest Court of Bangladesh Supreme Court. Whether the writ-petitioner company is entitled to the provision of the convention or whether the deduction of Advance Income Tax can be applicable against the writ-petitioner company is a pure question of law as appears from the provision of section 52 of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and the provision of Convention and therefore this court is of firm view that the instant writ petition is a maintainable as the question as has been raised by the writ-petitioner company does not come under the purview of the Arbitration Clause embodied in the contract agreement clause 45.5 of the GCC.<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>    Clause No. 14 of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 runs as follows;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Clause-14: Taxes and Duties</em><br/><em>14.1 Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall bear and pay all taxes, duties, levies and charges assessed on the Contractor, its Subcontractors or their employees by all municipal, state or national government authorities in connection with the Facilities in and outside of the country where the Site is located.</em><br/><em>14.2 Notwithstanding GCC Sub-Clause 14.1 above, the Employer shall bear and promptly pay all customs and import duties as well as other local taxes like, e.g., a value added tax (VAT), imposed by the law of the country where the Site is located on the plant specified in price schedule No. 1 and that are to be incorporated into the Facilities.</em><br/><em>14.3 If any tax exemptions, allowances or privileges may be available to the Contractor in the country where the Site is located, the Employer shall use its best endeavors to enable the Contractor to benefit from any such tax savings to the maximum allowable extent.</em><br/><em>14.4 For the purpose of the contract, it is agreed that the Contract Price specified in Article 2 (Contract Price and Terms of Payment) of the Contract Agreement is based on the taxes, duties, levies and charges prevailing at the date twenty-eight (28) days prior to the date of bid submission in the country where the Site is located (hereinafter called “Tax” in this GCC Sub-clause 14.4). If any rates of Tax are increased or decreased, a new Tax is introduced, an existing Tax is abolished, or any change in interpretation or application of any Tax occurs in the course of the performance of Contract, which was or will be assessed on the Contractor, Subcontractors or their employees in connection with performance of the Contract, an equitable adjustment of the contract price shall be made to fully take into account any such change by addition to the Contract price or deduction there from, as the case may be, in accordance with GCC Clause 36 hereof.  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>46.</strong>    Clause 14.1A imposed the liability of payment of customs and import duties VAT and other taxes levied by Bangladesh at the port of entry on the shoulder of the employer the GTCL.<br/> <br/><strong>47.    </strong>Annexure-7, 8, 9 and 10 appended to the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No. 8 are the L Series opened by the Basic bank Limited at the instance of the employer the GTCL which shows the documents as a irregular documentary credit, this documents have been claimed not to be an L/C rather a import permanent in the affidavit-in-opposition submitted by the respondent No. 8 which not being a true writ petition of the document cannot be taken into consideration that the respondent No. 8 has not open L/C for importation of the permanent materials for the two Gas Compressor Stations.<br/> <br/><strong>48.    </strong>It appears that admittedly the employer GTCL released the permanent materials from the Chittagong Port upon paying all necessary customs duties including the Advance Income Tax @ 5%. Not it appears that the GTCL by deducting the said AIT from the bills of the writ-petitioner company claiming that the liability of payment of such AIT lies on the shoulder of the writ-petitioner company. We are unable to accept the contention.<br/> <br/><strong>49.    </strong>The provision of Clause 14.1 categorically imposed the liability of payment of taxes including the AIT upon the shoulder of the GTCL and from the facts of the circumstances it appears that the GTCL has discharged its duties accordingly and paid the said AIT at the source when releasing the permanent materials.<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>    Article-2.2 of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 imposed the liability of such importation upon the employer GTCL and accordingly the payment has been made in two distinct aspects one being the foreign currency aspect and the other being the Bangladeshi currency aspect which would be paid for the job to be done in respect of installation and commissioning of the Gas Compressor Station. So far the permanent materials are concerned few of those have been sold by the writ-petitioner company in Korea and others are imported from different parts of the World and accordingly the payment which has been stipulated in the contract agreement allowed to be paid in Great Britain Pound. US$, Euro and Korean KRW. Therefore this court finds that the responsibility of payment of income tax on the importation of permanent materials lies on the shoulder of the employer GTCL which cannot be transfer under provision of the Contract Agreement dated 21.10.2011 to the writ-petitioner company the contractor.<br/> <br/><strong>51.    </strong>It appears that the government of Bangladesh and the Republic of Korea entered into a convention for the purpose of avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. Admittedly the writ-petitioner company is a Korean company and it has opened the branch office in Bangladesh. Article-5 of the said Convention deals in the matter of permanent establishment which runs as follows;<br/> <br/><em>Article-5</em><br/><em><u>PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT</u></em><br/> <br/><strong><em>1.   </em></strong><em>For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.</em><br/> <br/><strong><em>2.   </em></strong><em>The term “permanent establishment” includes especially;</em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify"><em>A place of management;</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>A branch;</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>An office;</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>A factory;</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>A workshop;</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>A warehouse, in relation to a person providing storage facilities for others;

The Branch office which has been opened in Bangladesh has been categorically limited by the Board of Investment (BOI) in the permission it has accorded not to enter into any other business other than the business as obtained in the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011 and no allegation has been raised by the respondent that the writ-petitioner company is engaged in any other business then the contract agreement business. The responsibility of this Branch office has been argued by the learned Advocate Mr. Kamal-ul-Alam that only to gather information and to pass on the same to the Korean head office and to facilitate the smooth installation and commissioning job of the Gas Compressor Station in Bangladesh. This cannot be treated as may by Branch office a permanent establishment in derogation to the exclusion clause as has been made in Article-5(4)(e). In this respect the referred case in Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2005 has got relevance wherein their lordship in a Division Bench of this court categorically came to the decision upon considering the cases reported in 47 DLR and others that a Branch office opened for the purpose of gathering information and to pass on the same to its principal company does not come under the definition of permanent establishment. Therefore, this court finds that the writ-petitioner company has got no permanent establishment in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>53.    </strong>Article-7 of the said Convention runs as follows;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Article-7</em><br/><em><u>BUSINESS PROFITS</u></em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The profits of an enterprise of a contracting state shall be taxable only in that state unless the enterprise carries on business in the other contracting state through a permanent establishment situated therein.

The income that has been accrued to the writ-petitioner company from the sale of permanent materials to the employer GTCL cannot be termed as accrued in Bangladesh since the point of sale (POS) of those permanent materials has not been occurred in Bangladesh rather abroad. The moment of the permanent materials were boarded the responsibility of the seller ended on that point and the installation and commissioning of the sale cannot be connected with the sale of those materials although the writ-petitioner company is liable to maintain those permanent materials for a period of 730 (seven hundred thirty) days in Bangladesh. In this case admittedly the writ-petitioner company has  obtained the consideration price of those permanent materials within the periphery of Korea by way of receiving payment from their bank pursuant to the L/C opened by the employer GTCL as the payment has been made in Korea as consideration of the permanent materials that cannot be treated as have made in Bangladesh. Although the contract for sale has been made within the purview of the contract agreement dated 21.10.2011. Under this aspect of the case the writ-petitioner company is not liable to pay any tax in Bangladesh including Advance Income Tax so far the sale and supply of the permanent materials are concerned.<br/> <br/><strong>55.</strong>    <strong>Under the reasoning and discussion as above, this court finds merit in the rule that the</strong> deduction of the Advance Income Tax (AIT) @ 5% by the employer GTCL company from the bill of the writ-petitioner company as has been evidenced by Annexure-17 appended to affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent No. 8 has been made without any lawful authority and therefore this rule nisi is required to be made absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>56.    </strong>In the result, the rule nisi is made absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>57.    </strong>The deduction of money @ 5% as Advance Income Tax (AIT) at source from the contract price/bills of the writ-petitioner company against contract agreement No. GTCL/CSP/EPC/002 dated 21.10.2011 (Annexure-B) so far as it relates to the transaction took place outside the taxable territory of Bangladesh <em>i.e</em>. in Korea for selling and supply of the plant, mandatory spare part, equipments and the other materials to the respondent No. 8 in Bangladesh is hereby declared to have made without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong>    All the respondents are directed to refund back the money amounting to Tk. 19,51,56,447.59 deducted as 5% Advance Income Tax (AIT) at source from the foreign currency portion of the contract price/bills of the writ-petitioner company  as shown in Serial Nos. I and II in the table as mentioned in Paragraph No. 7 in the writ petition against contract agreement No. GTCL/CSP/EPC/002 dated 21.10.2011 (Annexure-B) within 45 (forty five) days from the dated of receipt of the certified copy of this judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>59.</strong>    Let the proceeding be treated as a continuous mandamus and the respondents are directed to file affidavit of compliance within 15 (fifteen) days after the actual payment made to the writ-petitioner.<br/> <br/><strong>60.    </strong>Let this matter appear in the list on 05.5.2014 as for order.  <br/>        <br/>However, there shall be no order as to costs.<br/>        <br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

By ‘direct evidence’ is meant when the principal fact, or factum probandum is attested directly by witnesses, things or documents. To all other forms, the term ‘ circumstantial evidence’ is applied; which may be defined, that modification of indirect evidence, whether by witnesses, things or documents, which the law deems sufficiently proximate to a principal fact or factum probandum to be receivable as 'conclusive' when the connection between the principal and evidentiary facts- the factum probandum and factum probnans- is a necessary consequence of the laws of 'Nature '; presumptive’ when the inference of the principal fact from the evidentiary is only probable whatever be the degree of persuasion which it may generate. Circumstantial evidence is the evidence of circumstances as opposed to what is called direct evidence. Evidence which proves or trends to prove the '' factum probandum'' indirectly by means of certain inferences of deduction to be drawn from its existence or its connection with other 'facts probantia' it is called circumstantial evidence. Authorship of a document can be proved like any other fact, by both direct as well as circumstantial evidence. ....(54)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>Circumstantial Evidence –––Circumstantial evidence means the evidence afforded not by the direct testimony of an eye-witness to the fact to be proved, but by the bearing upon that fact or other and subsidiary facts which are relied upon as inconsistent with any result other than truth of the principal fact. Circumstantial evidence may be best understood by comparison with direct evidence. It is not evidence direct to the point in issue, e.g. the statement of a person that he saw another give a fatal blow to the deceased, but evidence of various facts other than the facts in issue which are so associated with the fact in issue that taken together they form a chain of circumstances leading to an inference or presumption of the existence of the principal fact. ″Circumstantial evidence is merely direct evidence indirectly applied. And direct evidence, when closely analysed, is found to possess the inferential quality; Circumstantial evidence is something from which facts in issue are to be inferred. It is not to be expected that in every case depending on circumstantial evidence, the whole of the law governing cases of circumstantial evidence should be set out in the judgment. Legal principles are not magic in contentions and their importance lies more in their application to a given set of facts than in their recital in the judgment. The simple expectation is that the judgment must show that the finding of guilt, if any has been reached after a proper and careful evaluation of circumstances in order to determine whether they are compatible with any other reasonable hypothesis. Circumst-antial evidence means a fact on which an inference is to be found. The facts must be closely knitted and must carry conviction to the mind of a Judge. . . . (55)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>The circumstances by themselves without anything more, are not enough to connect the convict with the crime. It is, therefore, clear that the learned trial Court has committed a serious error of law in basing conviction of the convict on such circumstantial evidence which has failed to connect the appellant with the crime. ...(70)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 8</strong><br/><strong>It is well settled that mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. In this case, there is no evidence against the accused. Hence their subsequent abscon-dence cannot be treated as a circumstances leading to the inference of involvement in the crime. Mere abscondence </strong><strong>cannot always be a circumstances which should</strong><strong> lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remain absconding for sometime. . . .(76)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Penal Code (XLV of 1860)</strong><br/><strong>Section 302</strong><br/><strong>It is true that crime like murder is shocking in nature and also, revolting. The Crime is against Society and humanity, but the prosecution convicted the accused merely on suspicion that the accused committed the murder. There cannot be conviction for murder on mere suspicion or presumption. The commission of murder must be proved. The presumption cannot take the place of positive evidence. . . .(81)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 3</strong><br/><strong>The instant case is absolutely a case of no evidence against the appellants but the Court below without any legal evidence convicted the appellants in moral view. Legal evidence in a criminal trial is the evidence of the incriminating facts and circumstances of involvement of the appellants in the commission of offence inevitable pointing to their guilty as the perpetrators incompatible with the plea of their innocence. In view of the proved facts and circumstances of the present case which do not constitute any legal evidence moral conviction should not be substituted in place of the legal evidence. . . .

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong>      By these appeals convict-appellants have challenged the legality and propriety of the Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27-05-2007 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narsingdi, in Session Case no. 95 of 2003 convicting the appellants under Sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code and sentencing each of them to suffer imprisonment for life and also to pay a fine of Tk.5,000/- each in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for year more. Both the appeals having arisen out of a common judgment, these have been heard together and are being disposed of by this judgment.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. </strong>The prosecution as projected in the first information report(briefly as FIR) and unfurled at trial are that Amena Begum aged about twenty years (since deceased) daughter of Md. Ramjan Ali (PW.1) of village Sultanpur, Police Station Palash, District-Narsingdi was married with Md. Arif Buiyan of the same village before 1/1½ years of the occurrence.  She was carrying about four months. Since marriage sometime dispute errupted between them over trifling family matter. On 26-08-1998 she was in her parent’s home. On the same day, at night at 8:00 p.m. her accused husband Arif Bhuiyan and his cousin accused Delwar Hossain came and proposed to her mother (PW.2) for taking her in conjugal home. Accordingly at 9:00 p.m. she went with them. On the following day i.e. on 27-08-1998 at 12’0 clock her niece Nila (PW-7)) went to her conjugal home. She (Nila) was informed by her accused husband to the effect that she (deceased) did not go with him in the last night. Her (deceased) father and other inmates unsuccessfully searched her, then her father suspected that her accused husband Arif Bhuiyan and cousin Delwar Hossain with pre-meditated plan took her and subsequently murdered her and concealed her dead-body. Then on 29-08-1998 her father Md. Ramjan Ali (PW. 1) as informant reported the incident to the local Police Station wherein it was recorded as Palash P.S. Case no. 12 dated 29-08-1998 corresponding to G.R. no. 1134 of 1998 under Sections 364, 34 of the Penal Code. Later on 02-09-1998 her dead-body was recovered by the Police from the tank of a toilet of Abdul Awal, Advocate (PW.11). Police held inquest upon the cadaver and sent the same to the morgue for autopsy. With these allegations the prosecution was launched under sections 302, 34 of the Penal Code.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. </strong>The Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet accusing five accused including the appellants under Sections 302, 201, 34 of the Penal Code showing accused Delwar Hossain as absconding. After submission of the charge-sheet accused Delwar Hossain on 23-06-1999 surrendered before the Magistrate and he was taken into the custody. Subsequently he was granted bail by the learned Sessions Judge on 28-02-2000.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.</strong> Eventually the case was taken up for trial by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narsingdi wherein the accused were called upon to answer the charge under Sections 302, 201, 34 of the Penal Code to which the accused on dock pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. </strong>In course of trial the prosecution in all examined seventeen witnesses out of nineteen charge-sheeted witnesses. The defence examined none.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. </strong>After closure of the prosecution case accused on dock were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and again they repeated their innocence but led no evidence in defence.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. </strong>The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses are that of innocence and false implication.  It was divulged in defence that due to previous enmity and internal feud, they were falsely implicated in this case out of vengeance at the instance of local rivals.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. </strong>After trial the learned Judge convicted the appellants and another namely Arif Bhuiyan as aforesaid holding :</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">The prosecution successfully proved the facts of taking away the victim by the accused.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Soon-after the occurrence the accused were in absconding which are the inference of guilt of the accused.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The prosecution successfully proved the charge under sections 302, 201, 34 of the Penal Code by consistent and corroborative evidence; however charge was not proved against the co-accused Sohel and Md. Belayet Hossain. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9.</strong> Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order of conviction and sentence, the appellants preferred the instant appeal.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10. </strong>The learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the convict-appellants seek to impeach the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence on five fold arguments:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><u>Firstly:</u>   There is no legal evidence to make a nexus between the appellants and commission of murder of deceased Amena Begum.<br/><br/><u>Secondly:</u> The prosecution measurably failed to prove any motive of murder by evidence.<br/><br/><u>Thirdly:</u> Soon-after the occurrence the accused Arif Bhuiyan and Md. Delwar Hossain were interrogated by the locals and they were blaming each other in respect of taking away the deceased from her parent’s house. So in such blaming custody of the deceased by her accused husband is more probable.<br/><br/><u>Fourthly:</u> Although the prosecution succeeded to prove that both the accused went to the parent’s house of deceased and they took her from there but later upto recovery of her dead-body, their complicity was not proved by evidence. Therefore, the last seen theory in respect of culpability has no leg to stand. In support of their contention they refer the case of Arman Ali and others vs. The State BCR 1987 HCD-259 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>" (a) Deceased Motaher was taken away from his house by the accused. No inevitable conclusion that the accused persons killed Motahar. "</em><br/><em>(b) Assuming that the deceased Motahar was called by the accused persons in the manner said by PWs. 1, 3, 5 and 8, no hypothesis can be drawn from this fact which is incompatible with the innocence of the accused persons and as such no conviction can be upheld on these evidence. </em><br/><em>(c) The production of the sandals of the deceased by the sister of Surman and the marks of violence allegedly found in a land near their house by themselves are no evidence to prove involvement of the accused persons or any of them with the murder. </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>On the identical point they further refer the case of Hassen Ali and another vs. The State 38 DLR-235 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Merely because the two accused had called and taken away the victim to the previous evening it will be most unreasonable to think that none but the two accused abetted the murder which took place so many hours after the taking away of the victim. At least such a conclusion is not only out of scope but also absolutely unsafe to stretch the imagination so far. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;">        <br/>They also refer the case of State vs. Sree Ranjit Kumar Pramanik 12 BLD 284 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>" Circumstantial Evidence.</em><br/><em>Evidence of last seen together, whether is a weak type of circumstantial evidence for conviction for murder case.</em><br/><em>A    ' minor offence' and 'a lesser offence' whether are neither synonymous nor same kind of offence.</em><br/><em>Held: (i): ' Last seen together' is a weak type of circumstantial evidence on which to have a conviction, where evidence is necessary to find a link between the accused and the murder.</em><br/><em>(ii) A 'minor –offence' and a ' lesser offence',  are neither synonymous nor same kind of offence. so they did not fall under the same category. An offence to be a minor offence to a major one must be a cognate offence to a major one, having the main ingredients in common. The ingredients of the offence of murder and those of the offence of abduction for murder or for putting the abducted person in danger of being murdered are not common. Hence the offence under section 364 is not also a cognate offence to the offence under Section 302. "</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>In the case of Soleman and others vs. The State 1990 BLD 179 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>'' Mere taking away of the victim from his house without any overt act animus in the form of any hostile attitude or initial intention to kill will not justify conviction for such offences- The theory of ' last seen' must carry along with it a high degree of probability excluding all other theories save and except the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. ''</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong><u>Fifth and lastly:</u> </strong> The judgment and order of conviction and sentence based on misreading and non-consideration of the evidence on record which cannot be sustained in the eye of law.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11. </strong>The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State-respondent of both the appeals opposes the appeals and submits that soon-after the occurrence the accused Delwar remained absconding from the locality and till submission of the charge-sheet he did not appear before the Court. Such absconsion infers his guilt. She adds that PW 6 Jashimuddin found accused Masud in a suspicious movement around the graveyard of Sultanpur. So according to her he had the complicity in commission of murder of the deceased. She lastly submits that the prosecution by consistent and uniform evidence categorically proved that none but the appellants committed the murder. So last seen theory in respect of commission of crime has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.  In respect of her contentions she refers the case of Md.

Such question along with the submissions of the defence should be answered in the following manner:<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong>    In approaching and answering to the points drawn up, the cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence in awarding conviction followed by sentence upon an indicted person demands meditation. A legal survey of law, appraisal of evidence, browsing eye on materials brought on record, analysis of fact and circumstance of the case, inherent infirmities disturbing and striking facts of prosecution case are also required to be taken into consideration. Rival contentions surged forward from both sides shall be also addressed and considered by us.<br/> <br/><strong>44.    </strong>Fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence and justice delivery system is the innocence of the alleged accused who should be presumed to be innocent until the charges are proved beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of clear, cogent and credible evidence and that onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of charge against the accused lies upon the prosecution which must prove charge substantially as laid to hilt and beyond all reasonable doubt on the strength of clear, cogent credible and unimpeachable evidence. In a criminal trial, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts always rests on the prosecution and on its failure, it cannot fall back upon the evidence adduced by the accused in support of his defence to rest its case solely thereon. Proof of charge must depend upon judicial evaluation of totality of evidence, oral and circumstantial, and not by an isolated scrutiny. Prosecution version is also required to be judged taking into account the overall circumstances of the case with a practical, pragmatic and reasonable approach in appreciation of evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong>    It is always to be remembered that justice delivery system cannot be carried away by heinous nature of crime or by gruesome manner in which it was found to have been committed and graver the charge is greater is the standard of proof required. It should also bear in mind that if the accused can create any doubts by adducing evidence or cross examining the PWs in the prosecution case, the accused is entitled to get benefit of doubt. It is conveniently observed that though sad, yet is a fact that in our country there is a tendency on the part of the people to rope in as many people as possible for facing trial in respect of any criminal case. It has been even found that innocent person, including aged infirm and rivals, are booked for standing on dock. Some are acquitted by the Court of first instance and some by appellate Court, but only having been in incarceration for years. Such efforts on the part of relatives of victim and other interested persons invariably is done and thus it becomes difficult on the part of a Court to find out the real culprit. Under such circumstances and in view of the prevalent criminal jurisprudential system, a judge is to find out the truth from a bundle of lies and to shift the grain out of chaff. A Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent person is punished. A Judge, also presides to see that guilty man does not escape. Both are public duties. Law therefore, cannot afford any favour other than truth and only truth.<br/> <br/><strong><em>46.</em></strong><em>    W</em><em>e should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration. </em></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>There must be clear and unequi-vocal proof of the corpus delicit.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The hypothesis of delinquency should</em><em> be consistent with all the facts proved.</em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>         Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.</em><br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong>    On going to the materials on record it transpires that in course of trial  the prosecution in all examined seventeen witnesses. Of them, PW 1 is the informant and father of the deceased. PWs. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 were the inmates of the informant’s house, in their presence appellants approached for taking Amena( since deceased) and took away. PWs. 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are the locals witnesses. They heard about taking away the deceased from PW.1, of them dead-body was recovered from the tank of a toilet of Abdul Awal, Advocate (PW.11). PW.12 also a local witness. He head the occurrence and witnessed of taking away the deceased.  PW. 13 mother of the accused Masud. She was hostile by the prosecution. PWs. 14, 15, 16 and 17 are the officials witnesses, of them PW. 14 recorded the statements of PW 3 Mariam and PW. 15 carried the dead-body to the morgue, PW. 16 is the investigating officer, PW.17 held autopsy upon the cadaver of the deceased.<br/> <br/><strong>48.</strong>    On meticulous examination of the evidence on record we find that there were virtually three circumstances upon which the prosecution relied:<br/><u>Firstly</u>: On 26-08-1998 after evening deceased Amena Begum was  at her parent’s house at Sultanpur.<br/><u>Secondly:</u> On the same night the co-accused Arif Bhuiyan and appellant Delwar happened at the home and took away the deceased.<br/><u>Thirdly:</u> On 02-09-1998 her dead-body was recovered from the tank of toilet of Abdul Awal, Advocate (PW.11). Since taking away the deceased upto recovery of the dead-body, whether the appellants had any incriminating acts in respect of murder of the deceased.<br/> <br/><strong>49.    </strong>Let us now consider how far the prosecution could prove the above circumstances against the appellants.<br/> <br/><strong>50.</strong>    On exploration of the evidence on record we find that the prosecution case absolutely rest upon the evidence of PWs. 2,3,4,5 and 7 and others witnesses were examined to corroborate them. PW. 2 mother of the deceased categorically stated that on 26-08-1998 at 9:00 p.m. the accused Arif Bhuiyan and Delwar took away the deceased. Subsequently on query on the following day, the accused husband of her daughter Arif Bhuiyan could not give any satisfactory answer in respect of her daughter. Her evidence regarding taking away of the deceased although corroborated by PWs. 3,4,5 and 7 but they failed to provide any evidence against the two appellants regarding any incriminating acts since taking away the deceased upto recovery of the dead-body.<br/> <br/><strong>51.    </strong>Firstly, we shall consider the evidence so far adduced against the accused Masud. We find that out of seventeen witnesses , thirteen witnesses were the locals, of them PW. 6 Jashimuddin he merely stated that he found Masud in front of the graveyard of Sultanpur moving in a very suspicious way, on 26-08-1998 at 12’0 clock. It is pertinent to point out that since that time this witness had no knowledge about taking away the deceased Amena from her parent’s house. So presuming him to move suspiciously warrant no inference of his guilt. Although PW. 13 Mariom, mother of accused Masud Mia made statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate providing some incriminating facts against her son but in the Court she disowned all such facts. Although she was declared hostile and she was cross-examined by the prosecution but nothing could be elicited to shake its credibility in respect of materials parts of her evidence. Therefore we failed to discover any incriminating material against convict Masud in any manner whatsoever.<br/> <br/><strong>52.</strong>    Now we shall consider the evidence adduced against the rest appellant Delwar Hossain. It transpires that the prosecution alleged that the deceased Amena was taken away from her parent’s house by accused Arif and Delwar but we failed to discover any iota evidence that the deceased Amena went alone with Delwar. It further appears to us from evidence that on the following day of the occurrence at the point of query by the locals both the accused Arif and Delwar were blaming each other in respect of taking away deceased. The circumstances aswellas the probability indicates that deceased Amena should be in custody to her husband. Moreso from the materials on record we succeeded to find that Delwar was an old man aged about seventy years at the time of occurrence, Now he attained the age of eighty one years. So it is the legitimate presumption that he may merely accompanied the accused husband Arif Bhuiyan in his in-laws house for taking Amena. We do not find any incriminating acts furnished by the prosecution against appellant Delwar. Therefore, we find that although first and second circumstances prevails against accused Delwar but there is absolutely no evidence in respect of third circumstance against him. So the above facts indicate that the above circumstances suffer from legal continuity.<br/> <br/><strong>53.</strong>    The rule of circumstantial evidence is that the chain of circumstances must be knitted together closely so asto lead to an irresistible conclusion that the accused alone had committed the offence by excluding the possibility that any other person might have committed the offence. The chain of events must be such that the possibility of innocence of accused is wholly excluded and such facts are incapable of explanation of any other reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused. Such required circumstances are not present in this case. So the judgment and order of conviction and sentence relying on the circumstantial evidence by the learned Judge of the Court below cannot be accepted.<br/> <br/><strong>54.</strong>    Circumstantial Evidence- All judicial evidence is either direct or circumstantial. By ‘ direct evidence’ is meant when the principal fact, or factum probandum is attested directly by witnesses, things or documents. To all other forms, the term ‘ circumstantial evidence’ is applied; which may be defined, that modification of indirect evidence, whether by witnesses, things or documents, which the law deems sufficiently proximate to a principal fact or factum probandum to be receivable as 'conclusive' when the connection between the principal and evidentiary facts- the factum probandum and factum probnans- is a necessary consequence of the laws of 'Nature '; presumptive’ when the inference of the principal fact from the evidentiary is only probable whatever be the degree of persuasion which it may generate. Circumstantial evidence is the evidence of circumstances as opposed to what is called direct evidence. Evidence which proves or trends to prove the '' factum probandum'' indirectly by means of certain inferences of deduction to be drawn from its existence or its connection with other 'facts probantia' it is called circumstantial evidence. Authorship of a document can be proved like any other fact, by both direct as well as circumstantial evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>55.    </strong>Circumstantial evidence means the evidence afforded not by the direct testimony of an eye-witness to the fact to be proved, but by the bearing upon that fact or other and subsidiary facts which are relied upon as inconsistent with any result other than truth of the principal fact. Circumstantial evidence may be best understood by comparison with direct evidence. It is not evidence direct to the point in issue, e.g. the statement of a person that he saw another give a fatal blow to the deceased, but evidence of various facts other than the facts in issue which are so associated with the fact in issue that taken together they form a chain of circumstances leading to an inference or presumption of the existence of the principal fact. Ina sense circumstantial evidence is also direct as the testimony must be that of persons who saw, heard of perceived the series of other the facts referred to before. ″Circumstantial evidenced is merely direct evidence indirectly applied. And direct evidence, when closely analysed, is found to possess the inferential quality; Circumstantial evidence is something from which facts in issue are to be inferred. It is not to be expected that in every case depending on circumstantial evidence, the whole of the law governing cases of circumstantial evidence should be set out in the judgment. Legal principles are not magic in contentions and their importance lies more in their application to a given set of facts than in their recital in the judgment. The simple expectation is that the judgment must show that the finding of guilt, if any has been reached after a proper and careful evaluation of circumstances in order to determine whether they are compatible with any other reasonable hypothesis. Circumstantial evidence means a fact on which an inference is to be found. The facts must be closely knitted and must carry conviction to the mind of a Judge. The dogs of the dog squad pointing towards the accused cannot be said to be a circumstance which can exclude the possibility of guilt of any person other than that of the accused or be compatible only with the hypoesthesia of guilt of the accused.<br/> <br/><strong>56.</strong>    The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction, must be complete chain and in capable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused. It must be qualitatively such that on every reasonable hypothesis, the conclusion must be that the accused is guilty not on fantastic possibilities not fresh interference, but rational deduction which reasonable minds make from the probative force of facts if circumstances (AIR 1984 SC 1622, 1994 BLD 33). Where all the evidence is circumstantial it is necessary that cumulative its effect should be to exclude any reasonable hypothesis of the innocence of the accused (1985 BLD (AD) 301). The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established and the circumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency. There must be chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that all human probability the act must have been done by the accused and the accused alone ( AIR 1990 SC 214).<br/> <br/><strong>57.    </strong>Court has to conclusively decide the guilt or otherwise of the accused in clear terms but cannot leave the accused to be punished by Allah. This is peculiar and unknown method which the Apex Court strongly disproved and upon reassessment of the evidence on record convicted accused–respdt. since acquitted by High Court Division (10 MLR(AD)175).<br/> <br/><strong>58.</strong>    Sentence can be awarded on circum-stantial evidence provided all circumstances constituted a chain and no link is missing and their combined effect in that the guilt of the accused is established beyond any shadow of doubt (PLD 2003 SC 704). The onus is on the prosecution to prove that the chain is complete (AIR 1984 SC 1622). Where various links in a chain are in themselves complete then a false plea or a false defence may be called into aid only to lend assurance to the Court. In other words, before using the additional link it must be proved that all the links in the chain are complete and do not suffer from any infirmity (41 DLR 11).<br/> <br/><strong>59.    </strong>Where circumstances even if proved, there is a missing link and those circumstances can not lead to any irresistible conclusion that there was no other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused (61 DLR 310).<br/> <br/><strong>60.    </strong>In  a case based on circumstantial evidence the prosecution is under an obligation to establish fully and cogently each of the circumstances, which they want to rely upon [1992(2) Crimes 858]. The proved circumstances should be of conclusive nature and definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused. It is not necessary that each circumstances by itself be conclusive but cumulatively must form unbroken chain of events leading to the proof of the guilt of the accused and no link in the chain should be missing (PLJ 1999 SC 729). If the circumstances or some of them can be explained by any of the reasonable hypothesis then the accused must have the benefit of that hypothesis. In assessing evidence ordinary human probabilities but not the imaginary possibilities to be considered. When there is no direct witness to the commission of murder and the case rest entirety on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances relied on must be fully established. It is necessary to distinguish between primary or basic fact and inference of fact to be drawn from them. The Court has to consider the evidence and decide whether the evidence proves a particular fact or not whether the fact leads to the inference of the guilt of the accused or not is another aspect and in dealing with that aspect of the problem, the doctrine of benefit would reply and an inference of guilt can be drawn only if the proved fact are inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and are consistent only with his guilt( 1990 SC 214).<br/> <br/><strong>61.</strong>    The law in respect of circumstantial evidence is well settled, circumstantial evidence can only be acted upon if each and ever circumstance is individually and conclusively proved and the circumstances so proved mist collectively lead to the only conclusion that the accused persons are not guilty of the crime. The proved circumstances must form a chain so complete by itself that they should  result in the only conclusion of being consistent with the guilt of the accused (1989(2) Crimes 240 Delhi, 37 DLR (AD) 87). If there be any missing link the accused will escape through it, for in that case the prosecution case will not be proved upto the hilt (9 BLT(AD) 107).<br/> <br/><strong>62.</strong>    The rule as regards sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to be the basis for conviction is that the facts proved must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and in capable of explanation by any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt(43 DLR 512).<br/> <br/><strong>63.</strong>    The rule of circumstantial evidence is that each of circumstances must be knitted together closely so as to lead to an irresistible conclusion that the accused alone had committed the offence by excluding the possibility that any other person might have committed the offence. The chain of events must be such that the possibility of innocence of the accused is wholly excluded and such facts are incapable of explanation of any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused. If the circumstances do not provide any conclusive  of the guilt of the accused, he cannot be convicted merely on the ground that such circumstances provide a strong ground for suspicion against the accused. If the theory of guilt and innocence are equally probable, then also the theory that favour of accused must be accepted (1991 BLD 158).<br/> <br/><strong>64.</strong>    Relying on a number of decisions of the Supreme Court of the Sub-continent certain principles which are required to be followed in the criminal cases based on circumstantial evidence have been laid down in the case of Hasan Ali and another Vs. The State reported in 38 DLR(1986) 235 and those are reproduced below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“1. The circumstances for which an inference adverse to the accused was sought to be drawn must be proved beyond reasonable doubt;</em><br/><em>2. That circumstances, if proved, must be incompatible with their innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis that of this guilt. In other words, the inculpable facts must be such that the probability of innocence of the accused is wholly excluded ;</em><br/><em>3. If the circumstantial evidence does not furnish conclusive proof of the guilt of the accused he cannot be convicted merely for the reason that the circumstantial evidence provides a ground for strong suspicion against him;</em><br/><em>4. If the theory of guilt and the theory of innocence are equally probable, then also the accused cannot be convicted on such evidence.”</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>65.</strong>    In the case of Hasan Ali and another reported in 38 DLR 235 accused appellants were alleged to have gone to the house of the victim, called and brought him out and took him with them in the evening of 22-12-81 and the dead-body was found in the afternoon on the next day. In the said case it was held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>Merely  because the two accuseds had called and taken away the victim the previous evening it will be most unreasonable to think that none but the two accused had called and taken away the victim. At least such a conclusion is not only beyond the scope but also absolutely unsafe to stretch the imagination so far.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>66.</strong>   In the case of Abdul Aziz and others Vs. The State reported in 33 DLR 402 it has been held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>The evidence that the accused forcibly took away the deceased at night followed by the discovery of his dead-body next morning were not enough for conviction under sections 302,324 of the Penal Code.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>67.    </strong>In the present case there is no direct evidence of the commission of murder. Nobody saw the accused persons causing any assault on him and the whole case rests on the evidence of the P.Ws. 2–7, 12 but none of them has seen the occurrence.  The law on the point is now well settled. To put it in the words of Munir CJ expressed himself in the case reported in PLD 1950 Lahore 288(FB) in the following language :<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>To find a man guilty of a criminal offence on circumstantial evidence the facts proved must be consistent with the theory of guilt and incompatible with theory of innocence.” It is further observed in the case “no man is to be found guilty on circumstantial evidence unless the circumstances established against him are such that no reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt can be built upon them”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>68.</strong>    In the case of Eradu and others Vs. State of Hyderabad reported in PLD 1956 (SC) India Page 286 it is held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"> <br/>“<em>It is fundamental principle of Criminal Jurisprudence that circumstantial evidence should point inevitably to the conclusion that the accused and the accused only were the perpetrators of the offence and as such evidence should be incompatible with the innocence of the accused.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>69.</strong>    The instant case is pre-eminently case where there is total absence of physical circumstances and link to connect the accused appellant with the crime and in that situation ocular evidence, to carry conviction, has also not come from unimpeachable source and it is also not supported by any strong circumstances, so as to over come the inherent doubt by which such evidence is necessarily affected.<br/> <br/><strong>70.</strong>    The mode of approach of the evidence adopted by the learned trial Court is unsuitable for formation of a correct conclusion in a case of this nature. The Court below found that the accused were responsible for the crime without considering that the prosecution has failed to built up a link by circumstances so as to connect the appellant with the commission of the crime. There being no direct evidence in case and the circumstantial evidence being not conclusive, we cannot agree with the conclusion reached by the court below.<br/> <br/><strong>71.</strong>    In our opinion, the circumstances by themselves without anything more, are not enough to connect the convict with the crime. It is, therefore, clear that the learned trial Court has committed a serious error of law in basing conviction of the convict on such circumstantial evidence which has failed to connect the appellant with the crime.<br/> <br/><strong>72.</strong>    In the case of Tasliumuddin alias Tasir and three others Vs. State 44 DLR 136 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>The fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence is that circumstantial evidence should inevitable be to the conclusion that the accused and the accused only were the perpetrators of the offence and such evidence should be incompatible with the innocence of the accused”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong><em>73.</em></strong>    In the case of Rahman Vs. The St ate of U.P. AIR 1972(SC) 110 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>The   circumstances forming evidence must be conclusively established and even when so established they must form such complete chain that is not only consistent with the guilt but it is inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>74.    </strong>In the case of State Vs. Khasru alias Syed Mostafa Hossain and another 43 DLR (AD) 182 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“<em>Circumstantial evidences-Its conclusiveness- assessment of evidence- This is a case in which a minor boy, the victim of murder, was called away by and seen in the company of the two young accused for the last time before disappearance and then sometime thereafter the body of the victim was found out. The fact of calling away of victim Khairul by accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactory proved that the victim traveled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4-00/4.30 PM. On 04-01-1979. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward upto the time of recovery of the body Khairul at about 3.00/3.30 p.m. on the following day the accused were alleged to have been along with the deceased, the third  circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder, by PWs. 11 &amp; 12. The High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the TI parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position therefore comes to this that the third circumstance, that of, seeing the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfactory established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>75.</strong>    These view receive support in the case of Abdus Samad Vs. The State 16 DLR (SC) 261, Anisur Rahman and others Vs. The State 1986 BLD (AD) 77, 1987 BCR (AD) 187, Taslimuddin alias Tasir Vs. The State 44 DLR 136 and the cases reported in 11 DLR(SC) 365, PLD 1956 SC 286, 33 DLR 402. Nuru and another Vs. The State 1 BLC-582 (Para-14).<br/> <br/><strong>76.    </strong>In the case of the State Vs. Khasru alias Syed  Mostafa Hossain and another 43 DLR(AD) 183 held:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“Murder charge resting on circumstantial evidence-Accused’s motive in calling out and accompanying the victim boy- There is absolutely no material on record to show that anybody had at any stage expressed any suspicion that the accused might have had any evil motive in calling out he victim. All that the father said at the trial was that the motive for murder was to give him pain. This is no motive. He did not say why the young accused would cause him  pain. There is also no material to suggest even that there might have been some immediate and on-the–spot reason for the accused to cause violence to the victim or that they were acting at some others’ behest.” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>77.    </strong>According to the submissions of the prosecution and observations made by the learned Judge, it indicates that the accused remained absconding from the place of occurrence for certain period, which is a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt. In our view it is mere submissions and observations of the Court below. The prosecution measurably failed to establish by evidence that soon after the occurrence, the accused had any responsibilities to discharge his duties towards the occurrence. It is well settled that mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances leading to the inference of guilt of the accused. In this case, there is no evidence against the accused. Hence their subsequent abscondence cannot be treated as a circumstances leading to the inference of involvement in the crime. Mere abscondence cannot always be a circumstances which should lead to an inference of guilt of the accused. Sometimes out of fear and self respect and to avoid unnecessary harassment even an innocent person remain absconding for sometime.<br/> <br/><strong><em>78.    </em></strong><em>With this regard reliance are being placed in the cases of Monsur Ali Vs. The State 13 BLC 196. Similar views were taken in the cases of State Vs. Badsha Molla, 41 DLR 11, State Vs. Mofijuddin 4 BLD-481=10 BLC-93, State Vs. Lalu Mia, 39 DLR(AD)117, State Vs. Sree Ranjit Kumer Promanik, 45 DLR 660, Ali Vs. Crown 6 DLR(W.P.)52, Rahman Vs. The State of U.P. AIR 1972(SC)110, Shajahan Vs. The State 46 DLR-575, Mojibur Rahman Vs. The State 13 MLR-88.</em><br/> <br/><strong>79.</strong>    We should bear in mind, credibility of testimony oral and circumstantial, depends considerably on a judicial evaluation of the totality, not isolated scrutiny. When dealing with the serious question of guilt or innocence of persons charged with crime, the following principles should be taken into consideration.</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The onus of proving everything essential to the establishment of the charge against the accused lies on the prosecutor.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The evidence must be such asto exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, for it is better that several guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person suffer.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>There must be clear and unequivocal proof of the corpus delicit.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The hypothesis of delinquency should be consistent with all the facts proved.        </em></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Inspite of the presumption of truth attached to oral evidence under oath if the Court is not satisfied, the evidence inspite of oath is of no avail.<br/> <br/>80.    Moreover, it is the definite case of the prosecution that there was an internal feud between the parties and when there is a background of enmity and the witnesses are chance witnesses and not natural witnesses and further natural and independent witness were not produced, it is unsafe to rely on the evidence of chance witnesses to make a nexus between the appellants and the crime. So we hold that there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the appellants with the crime of murder. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.<br/> <br/><strong>81.</strong>    It is pertinent to point out that the learned Judge convicted one set of  accused and acquitted other set over the selfsame of evidence on record. There is no mis-match or distinction between the acquitted accused and the convicts so far as the ocular testimony is concern. The eye witnesses having been disbelieved against one set of accused should not be believed against other set without any independent corroboration.<br/> <br/><strong>82.</strong>    It is true that crime like murder is shocking in nature and also, revolting. The Crime is against Society and humanity, but the prosecution convicted the accused merely on suspicion that the accused committed the murder. There cannot be conviction for murder on mere suspicion or presumption. The commission of murder must be proved. The presumption cannot take the place of positive evidence, (1970 P. Crl. L.J.-166).<br/> <br/><strong>83.</strong>    It further appears to us that the instant case is absolutely a case of no evidence against the appellants but the Court below without any legal evidence convicted the appellants in moral view. Legal evidence in a criminal trial is the evidence of the incriminating facts and circumstances of involvement of the appellants in the commission of offence inevitable pointing to their guilty as the perpetrators incompatible with the plea of their innocence. In view of the proved facts and circumstances of the present case which do not constitute any legal evidence moral conviction should not be substituted in place of the legal evidence.<br/> <br/><strong>84.</strong>    The appellants were convicted merely on suspicion without any legal evidence. To that end in view, law is now well settled that suspicion or doubt however strong it might be cannot take place of evidence or there be slightest doubt asto the involvement of the appellants in the crime, they cannot be convicted. With this regard reliance are being placed in the cases of Abdul Haq and others  Vs. The State 14 BLT 485, Fazu alias Fazlur Rahman Vs. The State 1 BLC 558, Rekatfullah Vs. The State 13 DLR-750. It is further held in the case reported in AIR 1921(PC)69, that the decision of the Court must rest upon legal ground established by legal testimony from the prosecution.<br/> <br/><strong>85.</strong>    Moreso in all respect, the convict appellants are also entitled to benefit of doubt. In the case of Safder Ali Vs. Crown 5 DLR(FC) 107 held:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“<em>In a criminal case, it is the duty of the Court to review the entire evidence that has been produced by the prosecution and the defence. If, after an examination of the whole evidence, the Court is of the opinion that there is a reasonable possibility that the defence put forward by the accused might be true, it is clear that such a view reacts on the whole prosecution case. In these circumstances, the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt, not as a matter of grace, but as of right, because the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt”.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>86.</strong>    So, there is no cogent, convincing and unimpeachable evidence on record to prove the complicity of the appellants with the crime of murder. Prosecution utterly failed to bring home guilt to the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.<br/> <br/><strong>87.</strong>    Moreover the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence so far as it relates to the appellants in its entirety is not well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. We have gone through the decisions as referred by the learned Deputy Attorney General. We are in respectful agreement with the principles enunciated therein but the facts leading to those cases are quite distinguishable to that of the instant case. Therefore we are unable to accept her submissions. On the contrary the submissions advanced by the learned Counsels for the defence prevail and appear to have a good deal of force.<br/> <br/><strong>88.</strong>    In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities referred to above, we are of the view that the impugned judgment and order of conviction and sentence so far as it relates to the appellants suffer from legal infirmities which calls for interference by this Court. Thus the appeals having merit succeeds.<br/> <br/><strong>89.    </strong>In view of foregoing narrative the appeals are allowed.</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">The impugned Judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 27-05-2007 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narsingdi, in Session Case no.95 of 2003 so far as it relates to the appellants Masud Mia and Delwar is hereby set aside and they are acquitted from the charge leveled against them.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The convict appellant Delwar Hossain Bhuiyan alias Md.

The right of pre-emption comes into existence after a valid, complete and bona-fide sale, i.e. after the title has passed to the purchaser, and cannot be exercised in the case of any other alienation. The right to pre-emption is very special in its character. It is founded on the supposed necessities of a Mohammedan family, arising out of their minute Sub-division and inter-division of ancestral property. We have already seen that before invasion of Muslim such right was not known to the people of the subcon-tinent. Right of pre-emption is not right of repurchase but a simple right of substitution to stand in the shoes of vendee.            . . .

This law point can be easily answered in this way as to whether Hindu purchaser be the pre-emptor can pre-empt the transfer under Mohammedan Law. The answered is a emphathic ‘No’. Since the Hindu purchaser or any non-Muslim cannot invoke the Mohammedan Law in any of their daily affairs, their right to all aspects including right to hold property invoking such law, (i.e. Mohammedan Law) cannot be taken away. Mohammedan Law is personal law and anybody come within the four corners of Mohammedan Law, then privision of personal law shall prevail.                              . . .

To answer this legal question the facts of the case are not so important but short glimps is required.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Mostafa Unuch, plaintiff, a practicing lawyer of Khulna Bar is pre-emptor, invoking right of sufa stating that the suit jote, measuring .52 acres of land, recorded in S.A khatian No.28, plot No.507 situated at mouza of Halatola under P.S. Khulna, Dist. Khulna originally belonged to A.H.M. Ali Hafez, Motwalli of Usuf Waqf Estate. The beneficiary of the said waqf estate, Karimunnessa and A.H.M. Ali Hafez transferred .05 decimals of land to plaintiff through kabala dated 19.8.1966 and the plaintiff possessed the said land by erecting house thereon, living there with family and became co-sharer of the land. Defendant Nos.4-5 transferred .0825 acres of land along with dwelling house upon the land to defendant Nos.1-3, who are stranger, by deed dated 28.8.2004 at a consideration of Tk.12,00,000.00 behind the back of the plaintiff. He could gathered knowledge of transfer when he saw defendant Nos.1-3 watching the suit land standing in the path way beside the house of the plaintiff and disclosed that they have purchased the suit land along with the dwelling house thereon. No sooner he heard the news of sale of the suit land, plaintiff instantly jumped into the suit premises claiming right of pre-emption and his intention of purchasing the suit property in presence of witnesses Mr. Shaful Alam, Advocate, Mr. Asadul Alam, Advocate Mr. Mofizur Rahman Advocate, Mr. Ashok Kumar Singha, Mr. Nur Mohammad. Thereafter, plaintiff performed Talab-i-Ishhad. The mother of pre-emptor purchased the share of one, Chapala Bala, co-sharer in the jote, died, leaving plaintiff as only heir. Plaintiff possessed his own land in the adjacent east side of the suit land and for expanding his narrow pathway for which he suffering and for enjoyment of wide pathway the suit land is required, hence the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Defendant Nos.1-3 appellants contested the suit by filing written statement wherein after taking all the objections as to maintainability of the suit, it is their case that, the suit land originally belonged to A.H.M Ali Hafez, the motwalli of Usuf Waqf Estate. The beneficiary of the said Waqf Estate, Mrs. Karimunnessa and Mrs. Hakimunnessa transferred .0825 decimals of land to Mrs. Aziza Akhterjahan Chowdhury vide deed No.8020 dated 16.12.1961. She possessed the suit land by constructing high boundary wall and erecting two storied building, separated the joma by opening separate khatian No.469 through Miscellaneous Case No.430/63-64, died, leaving two sons, defendant Nos.4 and 5 as heirs, who transferred the suit land to defendant Nos.1-3 through kabala dated 18.8.2004 vide deed No. 2666 within the knowledge of the plaintiff. After purchase, defendants mutated their names through Miscellaneous Case No.221 of 2004 on 23.9.2004, a separate khatian was prepared with the advice of the plaintiff; Plaintiff also mutated his name for his purchased .05 decimal of land from the plot through Miscellaneous Case No.287(1) 78-79 and opened separate khatian No.28/1. So pre-emption is not maintainable. Plaintiff failed to prove the formality of Talab-i-Mowsibat as well as Talab-i-Ishhad.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> After examination of the witnesses and exhibits learned Judge decreed the suit as aforesaid.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> In the instant suit before we answer the legal question we notice some peculiar facts as plaintiff being an old man of 71 years, jumped over the fencing of the suit land and claimed Talab-i-Mowasibat which is not believable. Another improbability is that in the evening junior Advocate normally do not accompany their senior Advocates but in this suit we find long after lunch, junior Advocates accompany their learned Senior Advocate probably for   applying Talab-i-Mowasibat. These facts according to us are creation of mind, not in reality.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> We have already seen that plaintiff is Muslim governed by personal law i.e. by Mohammadan Law of pre-emption but defendants are Hindus not covered by the Mohammadan Law of pre-emption. <br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> This is only case in Bangladesh as well as erstwhile Pakistan where a Mohammadan exercise right of pre-emption under Mohammadan Law against Hindu.  There is not a single instant of such kind of dispute arise in anywhere from 1947 up to now.<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9.</strong> Learned Advocate for the respondent relied on the case of Maslik Hussain and others vs. Lala Ram Chand and others, 22 DLR(SC)-275. This is a case under Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913 where the ratio descidendi was whether partial pre-emption is allowable or not. This case is not applicable as it is a case not on Mohammadan Law of pre-emption but on statutory law. Let we quote a portion of this judgment:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“18. in this case, pre-emption has been claimed under statute law. The area in which the lands under pre-emption lie is covered by the North-west Frontier province pre-emption Act, 1950. This Act was enacted on the 20<sup>th</sup> March, 1950, but the sale which gave rise to the right of pre-emption took place on the 21<sup>st</sup> December, 1943. Section 10 of the said Act provides that in respect of all sales and foreclosures’ completed before the commencement of that Act, the right of pre-emption shall be determined by the law in force at the time of such completion. Now, the Chief Commissioners of the then North-west Frontier Province, by Notification No. 9121.G./ 12-49. 22-24, dated the 20<sup>th</sup> October, 1924 issued under section 5 and 5.A of the schedulled Districts Act, 1874, as amended by the Devolution Act, 1920, extended to the North-west Frontier Province the Punjab-pre-emption Act, 1913 (Punjab Act 1 of 1913), subject to certain modifications in sections 15, 19 and 22 of that Act. Thus, the claim for pre-emption in the instant case shall have to be determined having regard to the provisions of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1913.’’</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Learned Advocate next relied on the case of Gobind Dayal vs. Inayatullah, Brij Mohan Lal vs. Abul Hasan Khan, ILR 1885 (All)-775 this decision settled that Mohammadan Law pre-emption can be applied against Hindus.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> We have carefully read this full Bench decision. A lengthy discussions have been made and several proposition of pre-emption under Mohammadan Law has been discussed and several decisions’ have been referred, in some agreed and in some differed and allowed pre-emption under Mohammadan Law against a Hindu after finding that there is no pre-emption under Hindu Law, and applied Mohammadan Law not as law by which the Courts are bound but only on general principles of justice, equity and good conscience as there was no corresponding statutory law to be applied by non-Muslims.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> It is held in this full bench discussion that the fact that ‘’some of the parties concerned in the present cases are Hindus, need not therefore in itself complicate the question as to the applicability of the Muhammadan Law, nor create any such difficult as would otherwise have arisen with regard to the question how the rule of pre-emption is to be administered according to justice, equity, and good conscience, in a case where, some parties being Hindus and the other Muhammadans, the law of each provided different rules for the enforcement of the pre-emptive right .<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> I now turn to the case law upon the subject. In Ramrutun Singh v. Chunder Naraen Rai (1) (I.S.D.A Rcp,1) which is the earliest reported case, having been decided in 1792, it was held by the Bengal Sadr Diani Adwlat, that among the holders of separate shares of an hereditary zamindari, each, according to the Hindu Law, may sell his share to whom he pleases, and the other sharers have no necessary right of pre-emption. And in Ram Kanhace Rai v. Bung chund Bunhoojea(2), (3 SDA Rcp17), decided in 1820, it was held that vicinage and partnership did not confer any right of pre-emption according to the Hindu Law as current in Bengal.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> Although the other judges concur with the bottom line of the judgment delivered by Mahmud, J but with a short of difference as:    <br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> OLDFIELD, J:- the answer should be in the affirmative concur in the opinion expressed in the case in Chundo v. Hakeem Alim-ood-deen (1), N.W.P.H.C. Rep.1871 p 28)  by the majority of this Court, that by the pro-visions of s.24, Act VI of 1871, the Court is not bound to administer the Muhammadan Law in claims of pre-emption, but on grounds of equity that law has always been held to bind Muhammadans, and has always been administered as between them in claims for pre-emption. Muhammadsns therefore as between themselves, hold property subject to the rules of Muhammadan Law and it would not be equitable that persons who are not Muhammadans, but who have dealt with Muhammadans, in respect of property, knowing perfectly well the conditions and obligations under which the property is held should, morely by reason that they are not themselves subject to Muhammadan Law, be permitted to evade those conditions and obligations. I wish to add that although i was a party to Moti  Chand v. Muhomed Hoseein Khan (2), (N.W.F.P.H.C,1875 p 147) my decision followed the Full Bench ruling in chundo v. Hakeem Alim-ood-deen (1) by which i felt myself bound.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> BRODRURST, J, concurred.<br/>     <br/>PETHERAM, C.J-my answer to the question referred to the Full Bench is in the affirmative. There appears to be no doubt as to what the rule of Muhammadan Law is, it imposes an obligation upon a Muhammadan owner of property, in the neighbourhood of which other Muhammadans have property, or in respect of which other Muhammdans have a share, to offer it to his neighbours or his partners before he can sell it to a stranger. This is an incident of his property, as the text-books of the Muhammadan Law show, and, for the reasons stated by my brother oldfield, i think that it is equitable to apply the rule to cases like the present, in which the purchaser is a Hindu.’’<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> In the instant case, pre-emptor is governed by the personal law i.e. Mohammadan law and pre-emptee purchaser is also governed by the personal law i.e. Hindu Law. Mohammadan Law provides pre-emptive right but Hindu law do not, and personal laws prevail. Muslim and Hindu are so intimately connected with religion that they cannot readily be dissevered from it. As long as the religious last, the laws founded on them last.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> To find out the originity of right of pre-emption it is pertinent to give a brief description, lest we forgot it, as we gathered from the old decisions, particularly from the aforesaid Full Bench decision of Allahabad High Court.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> ‘Right of pre-emption’ has been originated from Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him, PUB) I may observe that pre-emption is closely connected with the Muhammadan Law of inheritance. That law was founded by the prophet upon republican principles, at a time when the modern democratic conception of equality and division of property was unknown even in the most advanced countries of Europe. It provides that, upon the death of an owner, his property is to be divided into numerous fractions, according to extremely rigid rules, so rigid as to practically exclude all power of testamentary disposition, and to prevent any diversion of the property made even with the consent of the heirs, unless that consent is given after the owner’s death. When the reason is, not that the testator had power to defeat the law of inheritance, but that the heirs, having become owners of the property, could deal with it as they liked, and could therefore ratify the net of their ancestor. No Muhammadan is allowed to make a will in favour of any of his heirs, and a bequest to a stranger is allowed only to the extent of one-third of the property. Under these circumstances, to allow the Muhammadan Law of inheritances, and to disallow the Muhammadan Law of pre-emption, would be to carry out the law in an imperfect manner, for the latter is in reality the proper complement of the former, and one department of the law cannot be administered without taking cognizance of the other. Among Aryan systems, which favour the notion of the inchoate rights of heirs, the rule of primogeniture, the jus representations, and the exclusion of females from inheritance, except in special cases, the property is not so completely split upon on the owner’s death; but, under the Muhammadan system, upon a man’s death, not only his children are entitled to succeed to his property, but also his wife, mother, father, and other heirs, according to well defined rules.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> The law of pre-emption is coessentially a part of Muhammadan jurisprudence. It was introduced into India by Muhammadan Judges who were bound to administer the Muhammadan Law. Under their administration it became, and remained for centuries, the common law of the country, and was applied universally both to Muhammadans and Hindus, because in this respect the Muhammadan Law mades no distinction between persons of different races or creeds. A Musalman and a Zimmea being equally affected by principles on which shafa or right of pre-emption is established, and equally concerned in its operation, are therefore on an equal footing in all cases regarding the privilege of shafa.” (Hamilton’s Hedaya, vol. III, p.592). what was the effect of this? In course of time, pre-emption became adopted by the Hindus as a custom. I may here refer to an official paper printed in the Revenue Reporter, Vol. V, at p. 150, in which it is said that the rule of pre-emption has been adopted as a custom almost universally throughout these provinces, even by villages which are purely Hindu. I have already in Zamir Husain v. Davlat Ram (1), (ILR 5 All.110) and in the recent case of Sheoratan Kuar v. Mahipal Kuar (2),(ante P 253) explained my views as to the manner in which this cusom has been adopted by Hindu Community.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> Now, the main authority upon which the learned judges relied for the view that right of pre-emption does not exist before sale, is a passage in Mr. Hamilton’s Hedaya to be found at page 568, Vol. III, of his translation. The translation is at its best a very loose one when compared with the original Arabic text, which I shall literally translate here “pre-emption becomes obligatory (i.e, enforceable) by a contract of sale, which means after the sale. Not that sale is the cause (of pre-emption), for the cause is conjunction, (of the properties) as we have already mentioned. And the reason in the matter is, that pre-emption becomes obligatory when the seller has turned away from (i.e wishes to get rid of) the ownership of his house, and the sale makes this apparent. Hence, proof of sale is sufficient as against him even to the extent of the pre-emption taking it (the house) whom the seller acknowledge the sale, although the buyer contradicts him.”(1) (in Arabic) the meaning to be evolved from the passage is obviously different from the interpretation which can be placed upon Mr. Hamilton’s translation, which indeed to me to have misled mitter, J., and other learned Judges who agreed with him. The Arabic word tajibo which occurs in this and other passages, and which Mr. Hamilton translated as “established,” really means “becomes obligatory, necessary or enforceable”as a term of law, and I cannot help feeling that if the passage had been accurately translated by Mr. Hamilton, the majority of the Full Bench in Sheikh Kudratulla’s case might possibly have arrived at a very different conclusion. It is unnecessary to quot any more passages from the original Arabic text of the Hedaya, which distinctly go to show that the case or foundation of the right of pre-emption is the conjunction of the pre-emptive tenement with the pre-emptional tenement, that its object is to obviate the inconvenience or disturbance which would arise by the introduction of strangers, that the right exists antecedently to sale, and that sale is a condition precedent, not to the exislence of the right, but only to its enforceability. Mr. Hamilton’s translation is sufficiently accurate to indicate these conclusions, and i shall therefore pass on to ther books as high in authority as the Hedaya itself.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> The Muhammadan law having been evolved from the Kuran and the sayings of the prophet, naturally presents such difficulties, and the question whether the vendor is bound to offer the property to his co-parcener before selling it to a stranger, is an illustration of what i mean, a difficulty which was felt at an early stage by the Muhammadan jurists themselves. The following is a text from aini, a commentary upon the kanz, a well-known book on Muhammadan jurisprudence :-  “A co-parcener is one whose share has not been divided in the property sold. This is universally agreed upon, because it has been related by Jahir that the prophet decreed pre-emption, in respect of every joint undivided property, whether a grove or a house, saying:- “it is not lawful for anyone to sell till he has informed his co-parcener who may take or leave it as he wishes; and if he has sold without such information, the co-parcener has a preferential right to the share.” This tradition has been related by Mushini, Abu David, and Aukissai.”(1) (in Arabic) Two other traditions to the same effect are also to be found in muslim which is one of the books of acknowledge authiry on Hadis or traditions. I will, however, quote only one of them, as it brings into prominence the difficult with which i am now dealing :- “it is related by Jahir that the Prophet said:- “pre-emption exists in all joint properties, whether land, or house, or grove. It is not proper for him (the owner) to sell till he has offered it to his co-parcener, who may take it or reject it; and if the vendor fails to do this, his co-parcener has the preferential right to it until he is informed”.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> The author explains the traditions in the following manner:- The saying of the Prophet to the effect that it is not for him (the vendor) to sell until he has apprised his co-parcener is, in the opinion of our doctors, taken to refer to the moral property of giving notice and to the objectionableness of sale before such notice- an objectionableness which arises from impropriety. It does not, however, mean that such sale is “absolutely prohibited,”and this is the manner in which they have interpreted the Hadis (saying of the prophet), because it may be rightly affirmed of that which is morally objectionable, that it is not lawful, and thus the expression “lawful” comes to mean permissible, which implies that both sides (positive and negative) are on an equal footing, whilst that which is morally objectionable cannot be said to be permissible, both sides, of which are equal but, on the contrary the morally objectionalbe’is that the rejection of which prevails (over its adoption”) (1) (in Arabic)’’.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> As we find that this kind of dispute did not come for decision during the time of Pakistan, as such we have to find the answer from earlier citation during British rule. We have come across two Full Bench decision, one by Allahabad High Court, 7 ILR 775 another by Calcutta High Court 4 Beng LR 134. All the Courts of the Subcontinent either follow Allahabad decision that is Mohammadan Law of Pre-emption can be applied against non muslim or follow Calcutta decision i.e right of pre-emption cannot be applied against non-muslim under Mohammadan Law.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> Right of Pre-emption can be exercise when there is no defect of title in the vendor. The right of pre-emption comes into existence after a valid, complete and bonafide sale, i.e. after the title has passed to the purchaser, and cannot be exercised in the case of any other alienation. The right to pre-emption is very special in its character. It is founded on the supposed necessities of a Muhammadan family, arising out of their minute Sub-division and inter-division of ancestral property. We have already seen that before invasion of Muslim such right was not known to the people of the subcontinent. Right of pre-emption is not right of repurchase but a simple right of substitution to stand in the shoes of vendee. Before the British regime all the citizens of India followed Mohammadan Law. Allahabad decision as we referred, pre-emption case between Mohammadan pre-emptor and Hindu Pre-emptee where Mohammadan law applied according to justice, equity and good conscience. During Muslim regime jamindars i.e mostly Hindu had to invoke the right of pre-emption as per Mohammadan Law as during Muslim rule right of pre-emption was extended to all without any discrimination.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> We have already seen in the Full Bench decision of Allahabad reported in ILR VII (All)-775, a case between Muslim pre-emptor and Hindu purchaser, in that decision after reviewing the earlier decisions allowed pre-emption as per justice, equity and good conscious. This decision followed by a Division Bench of Patna High Court in the case of Achutananda Pasait vs. Biki Bibi, reported in 69 Indian Cases, 666 wherein on reviewing both Full Bench decision of Calcutta High Court and Allahabad High Court, the Court held:-<br/> <br/>         “The learned Vakil for the appellant relies for the proposition which he puts forward, namely, that the Muhammadan Law of pre-amption does not apply where the vendee is a Hindu, on the case of Shaikh Kodrutoollah v. Mohinss Mohun Shaha  13 W.B.21(F.B.;4 B.L.R.134). This decision is a full Bench decision of the Calontta High Court and ordinarily we would follow such a decision in this Court but the whole law on the point was subsequently elaboratery discussed by Mahmood, j, in the Full Bench case of Gobind Dayal v. Inayatullah, where the decision in Shaikh Koddrutcollah v. Mohinee Mohun Shaha was considered and it was held by him, four other judges of the Court concurring, that in such a case the Muhammadan Law of pre-emption did apply. I have very carefully considered these decisions and in my opinion, the view which has been taken by the Allahabad Court is the correct view of the law.’’<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong> In the decision of Hamedmiya Badamiya Saheb vs. Joseph Benjamin, 118 I.C-548 wherein also aforesaid two Full Bench decisions were reviewed but Bombay High Court followed the decision of Calcutta High Court. This case was between Mohammadan vs. Bene Israel and the judgment is as follows:- <br/> <br/>         “The language of the Regulations considered by the Calcutta and Allahabad High Courts is somewhat different. Mahmood j. In Gobind Dayal v. Inayatullah went to the length of holding that the law of pre-emption is a religious usage or institution within the meaning of s 24 of the Bengal Civil Courts Act, VI of 1871. Sir Roland Wilson in his Anglo Muhamuiadan Law (s.350), after referring to the view of Mahmood, j., observes that this reasoning proves too much, for if it were so, the whole of the Muhammadan Shariat, would be enforced including the law of property and contract. The other Judges, oldfield, J. And petheram, C.J.. have not expressed their concurrence with the view of Mahmood, J. on this point, and held that the Court was not bound to administer Muhammadan Law in Claims of Pre-emption, but came to the conclusion that the right of pre-emption was an incident of the property and it was equitable to apply the rule to cases where the purchaser was a Hindu on the ground of equity, justice and good conscience.’’<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong> “Coming to the Regulation (IV of 1827), Cl. 26 which governs the mofussil in the Bombay presidency, the law to be observed in the trial of suits shall be Acts of parliament and Regulations of Government applicable to the case which would include the Indian Acts of Legislature. It was held by Batchelor, J. in Mahmed Beg Amin Beg v. Narayan Meghaji patil (10) (32 IC 933) that the rules of pre-emption place a clog or fetter on the freedom of sale for which the transfer of property Act and the Indian Contract Act provide. Shah, J. However, has hesitated to accept the contention on the ground, first, that pre-emption according to the Muhammadan Law has been enforced in other parts of India and even in some parts of Gujarat in the Bombay presidency and that Chap. III of the Transfer of pro-perty Act which relates to sale of immoveable property does not purport to deal with the right of the vendor to sell, but only provides the mode of effecting sales and contains provisions as to the rights and obligations of the seller and buyer in the absence of a contract to the contrary, but both the learned judges have come to the conclusion that pre emption is opposed to justice, equity and good conscience. Batchelor, J., held that the view of the Madras High Court in Ibrahim Saib v. Muni Mir Uddin Saib (9) (6 M.H.C.R 26) was applicable generally to the Bombay presidency with the exception of certain parts of Gujarat. The Muhammadan Law of pre-emption, therefore, cannot be accepted in its entirety except on the ground of custom. In the Full Bench case of Gobind Dayal V. Inayatullah (1) (VII All 775) all the judges agreed that in the case of a non Muhammadan vendee the rule of Muhammadan Law of pre-emption could be applied on the ground of equity, justice and good con-science. That view is not accepted by the Madras High Court in Ibrahim Saib v. Muni Mir Udin Saib (9)(6 M.H.R.C.R 26) and the Calcutta High Court in Sheikh Kudratullah v. Mahini Mohan Shaha (6)( 4 BLR (FB)134) and by the Bombay High Court in Mahomed Beg Amin Beg v. Narayan Meghaji Patil (10) 32 IC 933). The right of pre-emption, in my opinion, not being an incident of the property for the reasons I have stated and not being applicable on the ground of justice, equity and good conscience according to Regulation IV of 1827, Cl. 26 and it being not a law of the defendant who is a Bane Israel under Cl. 26 of the Regulation of 1827, I think in the absence of custom a non-Muhammadan Bene Israel vendee cannot be bound by the law of pre-emption even though the law of pre-emption may have been established as Customary Law applicable to Hindus and Muhammadans in Ahmedabad.’’<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong> In Nusrut Reza v. Umbul Khyr bibee (15) ( 8 WR 309) Phear, J., observes:<br/> <br/>            “The right to pre-emption is very special in its character. It is founded on the supposed necessities of a muhammadan family, rising out of their minute subdivision and inter division of ancestral property, and, as the result of its exercise is generally adverse to public interest, it certainly will not be recognised by this Court beyond the limits to which those necessities have been judicially decided to extend.”<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong> The remark of privy Council in jadu Lal Sahu v. Janki koer, (5)(15 IC 639) may be looked into: that the right of pre-emption was enforceable irrespective of the persuasion of the parties concerned is not to be taken in a very wide sense, but must be taken as referring to the persuasion of the parties to the litigation who were Hindus of bihar with reference to whom the custom of pre-emption was recognised. In the case of Christian vendee it was held by the Calcutta High Court in Baboo Mohesh Lall v. Mr. John Christian and co. (16) (8 WR 446) that the right of pre-emption is not a matter of title to property but is rather a right to the benefit of a contract and when a claim is advanced on such a right, it must be shown that the defendant is bound to concede the claim either by law or by some custom to which the class of which he is a member is subject on grounds of justice, equity and good conscience.<br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong> “I think it would be manifestly unjust and inequitable that the Muhammadan Law of pre-emption should be enforced against a Bene Israel purchaser without giving him the benefit of that law in other cases in which he would like to stand in the position of a pre-emptor. There is no allegation in the plaint that the law of pre-emption is binding on the class to which the defendant belongs namely, the Bene Israel community. If such an allegation had been made, it would have been necessary in this case to send down issues to the lower Court, first, whether there is a custom among the Bene Israel recognising the law of pre-emption, secondly, whether the defendant is domiciled in or a native of Ahmedabad:”<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong> “In the present case there is no allegation in the plaint that there is a custom binding on the Bene Israel defendant, or that the defendant was bound by notice of any contract with the vendor.’’<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong> “The plaintiff can, therefore, only succeed if he can show that it is the usage of the country, that is of Ahmedabad City and if he can prove a custom amounting to a rule of law.’’<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong> “I agree that the lower Appellate Court’s decree should be confirmed and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.’’ <br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong> In the case of Sitaram Bhaurao Deshmukh and others vs. Sayad Sirajul Khan Nawab Amir Yar Jung Bahadur, reported in ILR-41- Bom 636. In this case Mohammad Ali Jinnah, creator of Pakistan, raise question on reference to the case of Mohammad Beg Amin vs. Narayan Meghaji the law of pre-emption is not consistent with the rules of justice, equity and good conscience and therefore it cannot be enforced against the appellants, all the High Courts except the Allahabad High Court have held the same view. Mr. Jinnah submits that, in Allahabad the peculiar circumstances existing in that part and the predominance of the Mahomedan population have led that Court to apply the law of pre-emption; Mr. Jinnah referred to the decision of Gobind Dayal v.Inayetullah(1885) 7 All. 775. Secondly, the defendants being Hindus the law which is applicable is the law of the defendants i.e. the Hindu purchasers under section 26 of the Regulation IV of 1827 as has been held in the case of Mahomed Beg Amin vs. Narayan Meghaji.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong> Their Lordships did not answer these questions, took a view not consistent with the proposition of law and held:-<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong> “It remains to refer to a point based upon the fact that the plaintiff’s case is now being prosecuted by his administrator appointed since the death of the plaintiff pendent lite. The administrator obtained Letters of Administration from the Thana Court and proceeded with the suit under the authority of an interlocutory judgment of this court. It has, however, been contended that under section 89 of the Probate and Administration Act the right of the Administrator does not extend to the prosecution of this suit inasmuch as the relief sought could not be enjoyed after the death of the plaintiff. The argument is that the right of pre-emption arises on the right of a co-sharer or neighbour to take personal objection to the purchaser entering upon the land of another co-sharer or neighbour. It may be conceded that that proposition is not incorrect, but it does not follow that the relief sought, namely, conveyance of a share, cannot be enjoyed by a personal representative, or those on whose behalf he holds, after the death of the pre-emptor. Indeed it is in our opinion obvious that it can be enjoyed, inasmuch as it adds the property in suit to the estate of the deceased. For these reasons the decree of the lower Court must be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong> In the case of Qurban Husain vs. Chote, reported in ILR 22 All-102, wherein the vendor is Shia and vendee is Sunny, it is held as:<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong> “The appellant is claiming what has been properly described as a weak right. He is trying to place a restriction upon liberty of transfer of property. It is for him to show that he is vested with some right or power to make such restrictions. The shia law gives him –a shia-no such right under the present circumsta-nces, and it is for him to show us that he can take advantage of the Sunni law, which he would be the first to repudiate did it place any similar restriction upon himself. As he has shown no law or precedent to the above effect, I would hold that he has not proved the existence of any such right of pre-emption in himself, and would dismiss the appeal with costs.’’<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong> From the aforesaid discussions we have seen that excepting the Allahabad decision ILR VII All 775 which having been reviewed, Mohammadan Law of pre-emption does no apply to non Mohammadans. Allahabad decision having failed to apply Mohammadan Law of pre-emption to a non muslim applied it on the principle of justice, equity and good conscious which is not within the law but can apply as per wisdom of the judges. Court is absolutely bound to follow law. Law is disciplined, civilized, society unless be disciplined then lawlessness prevail.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong> Now the question in hand whether pre-emptor rightly invoke his pre-emption right under Muhammadan Law against a Hindu, a non Muslim purchaser. This law point can be easily answer in this way as to whether Hindu purchaser be the pre-emptor can pre-empt the transfer under Mohammadan Law. The answare is a emphathic ‘No’. Since the Hindu purchaser or any non-Muslim cannot invoke the Muhammadan Law in any of their daily affairs, their right to all aspects including right to hold property invoking such law, (i.e. Muhammadan Law) cannot be taken away. Muhammadan Law is personal law and anybody come within the four corners of Muhammadan Law, then privision of personal law shall prevail. Mahmud J, in the decision of Full Bench, V11 ILR All  775 also observed “My idea is that the administration of law by kazis during the Muhammadan period gave mode currency to huq-i-shufa, and its advantage became so apparent to the Hindus that they attempted to naturalize it by working on its principles in Tantra in question, where an interpolation could easily be affected without any fear of detection. This must happened three or more countries ago”. Mahmud J, in applying Muhammadan Law of pre-emption to a non-Muslim, particularly to a Hindu, observed as:<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong> “It may be said in this way that so long the Muhammadan government ruled this sub-continent right of pre-emption was extended to all classes of persons without any distinction of creed, colour or birth as Muhammadan Law was law of the sub-continent’’.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong> Thus it is settled that Muhammadan can claim benefit of the law of pre-emption under Mohammadan Law but the Hindu purchaser cannot claim the benefit of that law.  <br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong> Thus we see in the instant case vendor is a Muslim and purchaser is a Hindu. By this time much water follows in the river Burigonga and by this time Pakistan was created and thereafter, Bangladesh got independence. State Acquisition and Tenancy Act along with Non-Agricultural Tenancy Act came into operation giving statutory right of pre-emption, and pre-emptor could invoke the provision of statutory law but we do not understand why the plaintiff being an Advocate instead of invoking statutory law jumped to personal law against a non muslim. Since the appellant could not invoke the provision of Mohammadan Law their purchase cannot be defeated by taking shelter of Mohammadan Law.   <br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong> We have seen that in 1885 there was no corresponding statutory law governing the field of pre-emption and at that time  pre-emption was governed as per provision of Mohammadan Law, if pre-emptor be Hindu then also he could pre-empt the land under the provision of law Mohammadan Law but now scenario has been changed and statutory law has come into operation giving right to all to pre-empt the land if law applies. In that view of the matter we find substance in this appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong> Before parting with the decision let us quote an interesting passage from the judgment delivered by Mr. Mahmud, J. In the Case of Gabinda Lal’s case. Mr. Mahmud, J observe as “because the rapid rise in the value of landed property in British India has gone far to extend the exercise of the pre-emptive right and to enhance it importance by compromising it as an incident of the proprietary tenure.” In 1883, long 131 years before there was price hike which is still continuing and price of lands to gather with scarcity of lands land become ‘golden deer’ can be observed in imagination not in reality.<br/> <br/>         In the result, this appeal is allowed. No costs.<br/> <br/>         The impugned judgment and decree complained are set aside.<br/> <br/>         Pre-emption Title Suit No.47 of 2007 is dismissed.<br/> <br/>         Send down the lower court records at once.<br/> <br/><strong>         Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

If a proceeding is now stopped after the coming into force of the new Act either by the High Court Division or by this Court, the prosecution will not have any corresponding right of revival of the proceeding under the repealed provision of section 339D of the Code. The accused will be scot free and no proceeding can be continued against him without a fresh complaint or First Information Report. It is therefore to be borne in mind that under the unamended provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code, the accused did not enjoy an unqualified right or privilege or facility of stoppage of proceeding and release if the trial could not be completed within 270 days. His right was commensurate with the right of the prosecution to revive the prosecution. It cannot be the intention of the new Act that it is only the accused who will carry prospectively, in spite of the amendment, his right of stoppage of proceeding and release, while the prosecution will prospectively lose its right of revival. The new Act has effected a change in the procedural law, but it has not affected any vested right of the accused and the prosecution, because the accused had not in fact any absolute and vested right of stoppage and release.

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/>         By this Rule, the State, represented by the Solicitor, Government of the Bangladesh as petitioner has challenged the legality and propriety of the order dated 25-07-1991 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, and Special Tribunal Judge, Dhaka (briefly as Judge) in Special Tribunal Case no. 294 of 1990 stopping further proceedings of the case and releasing the accused opposite parties under Section 339C of the Code of Criminal Procedure(briefly as the Code).<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong>      Facts in brief are that one Md. Abdur Razzak as informant lodged a first information report with Ramna Police Station against the accused-opposite parties alleging that on the night following 03-02-1990 at 1:00 a.m. all the accused in collusion with each other abducted his sister Sufia. Thereafter committed rape upon her. The case was recorded as Ramna P.S. Case no. 06 dated 04-02-1990 under Sections 323, 342, 109 and 376 of the Penal Code  read with Section 4 of the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance,1983 (briefly as Ordinance 1983).<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>      The Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet accusing all the accused.     <br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>      Eventually, the case was taken up for trial by the Tribunal wherein ultimately the accused filed an application under Section 339C of the Code stating that stipulated period for conc-luding trial was elapsed. So the proceedings should be stopped and they should be released. After hearing the learned Judge allowed the prayer and stopped further proceedings of the case and released the accused.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>      Feeling aggrieved the State-as petitioner preferred the instant revision for revival of the case under section 339D(1) (b) of the Code  and obtained the present Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>      The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State-petitioner seeks to impeach the impugned order on three fold arguments:<br/><br/><strong><u>Firstly:</u></strong>  Most of the time were allowed on the prayer of the accused-opposite parties on all false pleas to intentionally pass time for the trial as contemplated under section 339 C(4) of the Code.<br/><br/><strong><u>Secondly:</u></strong> The State was always ready and willing to conclude the trial within the specified period as provided under the law but due to the non-co-operation of the opposite parties the time limit ran out.<br/><br/><strong><u>Thirdly:</u></strong>  In order to secure ends of justice the case is required to be revived.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>      No one appears on behalf of the accused opposite parties to oppose the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>      In order to appreciate her submissions we have gone through the record and given our anxious consideration to her submissions.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>      On going to the materials on record it transpires that the accused-opposite parties were being tried by the learned Tribunal, under Sections 323, 342, 109 and 376 of the Penal Code and eventually by the impugned order dated 25-07-1991 the learned Judge stopped the proceedings and released the accused-opposite parties under Section 339C(4) of the Code as the stipulated period for concluding trial was expired. Afterwards the State, represented by the Solicitor preferred the instant Revision for revival of the case under Section 339D(1) (b) of the Code.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>    The Provisions of new section 339D of the Code for revival of the case was inserted by Section 3 of Ordinance no. XXVIII of 1986 which reads as hereunder:<br/>3. Insertion of a new section 339D, Act V of 1898.- In the said Code, after section 339C, the following new section shall be inserted, namely:-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>   " 339D, Revival of cases-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 339C, any proceedings in respect of the trial of a case stopped under sub-section (4) of that section shall be revived, if an application for such revival is made by the Government to the Court, where such proceedings were pending on the date they were stopped within ninety days from that date; and the proceedings thus revived shall continue from the stage at which they were stopped;   </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong>    Provided that where such Court is not in existence or has no jurisdiction to try the case for any reason the application for such revival shall be made to the Court which has jurisdiction to try such case.          <br/>(2) Where any proceedings are revived under sub-section (1), the accused in the case shall, if he is accused of a non-bailable offence, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Court unless for reasons to be recorded in writing the Court otherwise directs.<br/>(3) Where any proceedings are revived under sub-section (1), the trial of the case after such revival shall be concluded within the time specified in sub-section (1), or sub-section (2) of 339C, as the case may be,<br/>(4) If the trial of a case after revival cannot be concluded within the specified time, further proceedings in respect of the trial of the revived case shall stand stopped and the accused persons released.<br/>(5) In this section, in determining the time for the purpose of trial.-<br/>(a) the date of revival of a case shall be deemed to be the date on which the case is received for trial; and<br/>(b) only the working days shall be counted. "<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong>    Subsequently Section 339D of the Code was substituted by Section 5 of the Ordinance XII of 1991which reads as hereunder:  <br/> <br/>5.      “ Act V of 1898 Hl section 339D <em>এর সং­শাধন - উক্ত </em>Code <em>এর</em> section 339D <em>এর</em> sub-section (1), (2), <em>এবং </em>(3) <em>এর পরিব­­র্ত নিম্নর্রপ</em> sub-section <em>গুলি প্রতিস্থাপিত হই­বে,যথা -</em> <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;

margin-left: 40px;"><br/>″(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 339C, the Government or an aggrieved person may, on cogent grounds:-<br/>where the proceedings of the case were stopped and the accused person released in the Court of a Magistrate, make an application, within thirty days from the date on which the proceedings in respect of the trial of the case have been stopped, to the Sessions Judge;<br/>where the proceedings of the case were stopped and the accused person released in the Court of a Sessions Judge, an Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge, make an application, within sixty days from the date on which the proceedings in respect of the trial of the case have been stopped, to the High Court Division,<br/>for revival of the case and the Sessions Judge or, as the case may be, the High Court Division may pass thereon such orders as he or it thinks fit.<br/><br/>(2) Where the Sessions Judge or, as the case may be, the High Court Division orders for revival of the case, proceedings thereof shall continue from the stage they were stopped in the Court where such proceedings were pending on the date they were stopped, and where such Court is not in existence or has no jurisdiction to try the case for any reason, the proceedings shall continue in the Court which has jurisdiction to try the case.<br/><br/>(3) Where any case is revived under sub-section (2), the accused in the case shall, if he is accused of a non-bailable offence, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Court, unless for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Court otherwise directs.<br/><br/>(3A) Where any case is revived under sub-section (2), the trial of the case after such revival shall be concluded within the time specified in section 339C."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong>    Lastly Section 339 D of the Code was repealed by Section 4 of the Act XLII of 1992 which reads as hereunder:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৮।        Act V of 1898 এর section 339D এর বি­লোপ-উক্ত Code এর section 339D বিলুপ্ত হই­বে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong>    The Provision was made in section 6 of the new Act for application of section 339D, as if it was not repealed "which reads as hereunder:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৬।    কতিপয় ক্ষে­ত্রে Act V of 1898 এর বিলুপ্ত section 339D এর প্র­­য়োগ। - এই আইন দ্বারা উক্ত Code এর section 339D বি­লোপ সত্বেও, এই আইন বলবৎ হইবার পূ­র্ব section 339D এর সং­শোধন পূর্ব sub-section(4) এর বিধান অনুসা­রে বন্ধ হইয়া­ছে, এমন কোন বিচার কার্যক্রম পূনর্জ্জীবিত করার জন্য দরখাস্ত দাখিল, প্র­য়োজনীয় কার্যক্রম গ্রহণ এবং উহার নিষ্পত্তি এইরু­প করা যাই­বে যেন section 339C বিলুপ্ত হয় নাই।<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.</strong>    The question that arises in the instant case is that during pendency of the Criminal revision before this Court the new Provisions 339D introduced by Ordinance XXVIII of 1986 was repealed by Act XLII of 1992 came into force and this being procedural law whether it will apply to a pending case.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong>    Sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Cr.P.C. was in the following terms before amendment by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Second Amendment) Act 1992 (Act no. XLII of 1992).</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>″(4) If a trial cannot be concluded within the specified time as mentioned in sub-section (3), further proceedings in respect of the trial shall stand stopped and the accused person released. ″</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong>    It was provided in sub-section (3) of section 339C that if for any reason the Sessions Judge or the Additional Sessions Judge was unable to conclude the trial of the case within 240 days he shall conclude such trial within 30 days after the expiry of the specified time. In other words, the Sessions Judge or the Additional Sessions Judge was to conclude the trial within 270 working days. But sub-section (4) of section 339C has been substituted by Act XLII of 1992 which runs as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>″(4) If a trial cannot be concluded within the specified time, the accused in the case, if he is accused of a non-bailable offence, may be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Court, unless for reasons to be  recorded in writing, the Court otherwise directs. ″</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>19</strong>.    Before the Code of Criminal Procedure was further amended by Act no. XLII of 1992, shortly the new Act, it was the combined effect of all the sub-sections of section 339C and 339D of the Code that a trial of a sessions case had to be concluded within 240 days. With an additional grace of 30 days, where-after, as per sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code, "further proceedings in respect of the trial shall stand stopped and the accused person released". That was the right which the accused was seeking to pursue, but that right was not an absolute one. Under section 339D of the Code the proceedings could be revived upon a prayer from the prosecution within a stated period. The whole purpose of un-amended section 339C of the Code was to whip up the prosecution and activse the trial Court so as not to delay the trial of a case unnecessarily. It was also not a signal to the defence to resort to all manners of delaying tactics to get out of the trial net. The stopping of a case and the release of an accused would rouse the prosecution from its slumber and would necessarily subject it to an accountability. The purpose was not to give the accused a right not to be tried any more on the same charge or a clean bill of acquittal, even if he was accused of a heinous crime. Stoppage of the trial did not mean an end of the woes of the accused. A revival would revive his woes.        <br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong>    By the new Act the period of trial was extended to 360 days. By deleting sub-section (3) of section 339C of the Code the grace period of 30 days was done away with and by substituting sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code with a new sub-section (4) the proceedings cannot be stopped now and the accused can now only obtain bail to the satisfaction of the Court with the expiry of 360 days, if the trial has not been concluded. Section 339D of the Code has been repealed. The position now is, no stoppage, no revival.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong>    The legal position of an amendment in procedural law has been aptly summed up by SA Rahman J, ( as his Lordships then was) in the case of Md. Aslam vs. State 19 DLR (SC) 242 in the following words:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>         ″ ….. When the law is altered during the pendency of an action, the rights of the parties are to be decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights. Where the legislature has made its intention clear that the amending Act should have retrospective operation, there is no doubt that it must be so construed, even though the consequences may entail hardship to a party. But even without express words to that effect, retrospective effect may be given to an amending law, if the new law manifests such a necessary intendment. With regard to the procedural laws, the general principle is that alterations in procedure are retrospective unless there be some good reason against such a view. If a statute deals merely with the procedure in an action, and does not affect the rights of the parties, it will be held to apply prima facie, to all actions pending aswellas future. It is only if it be more than a mere matter of procedure, that is, if it touches a right in existence at the passing of new Act, that the aggrieved party would be entitled to succeed in giving a successful challenge to the retrospective effect of the Act….. ".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>22.</strong>    We are in respectful agreement with the afore quoted summing-up of the law on the subject.<br/> <br/><strong>23.    </strong>The new Act was not given a retrospective effect, but inspite of repeal of section 339D of the Code (provision of revival of a stopped proceeding), provision was made in section 6 of the new Act for application of section 339D of the Code, as if it was not repealed, when, before the coming into force of the new Act,( i.e. on the 1<sup>st</sup> November, 1992), a proceeding was already stopped under the unamended provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code. If a proceeding is now stopped after the coming into force of the new Act either by the High Court Division or by this Court, the prosecution will not have any corresponding right of revival of the proceeding under the repealed provision of section 339D of the Code. The accused will be scot free and no proceeding can be continued against him without a fresh complaint or First Information Report. It is therefore to be borne in mind that under the unamended provision of sub-section (4) of section 339C of the Code, the accused did not enjoy an unqualified right or privilege or facility of stoppage of proceeding and release if the trial could not be completed within 270 days. His right was commensurate with the right of the prosecution to revive the prosecution. It cannot be the intention of the new Act that it is only the accused who will carry prospectively, in spite of the amendment, his right of stoppage of proceeding and release, while the prosecution will prospectively lose its right of revival. The new Act has effected a change in the procedural law, but it has not affected any vested right of the accused and the prosecution, because the accused had not in fact any absolute and vested right of stoppage and release. It was fettered and chained with the prosecution’s right to revive the proceeding. Now both the corresponding rights are gone. No one can complain of any loss thereby. By necessary intendment of any Act will be retrospective in operation in so far as sub-section (4) of section 339C and 339D of the Code of the new Act are concerned. Those will apply to pending cases.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong>    On meticulous examination of the record we find that the impugned order was passed on 25-07-1991 and the instant revision was filed in the year 1991 upon which the Rule was issued on 17-12-1991. Therefore, the same will attract section 6 of the Act XLII of 1992, consequently the Special Tribunal Case no. 294 of 1990 will be revived. Thus the Rule have merit succeeds.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong>    In view of foregoing narrative the Rule is made absolute. The Special Tribunal Case no. 294 of 1990 pending in the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, and Special Tribunal Judge, Dhaka stands revived and the same shall proceed in accordance with law and in the light of observations made above.<br/> <br/><strong>26</strong>.    In view of the facts this is an old case of 1990, the learned Judge of the Court below is directed to dispose of the case within six months from date.<br/>        <br/>Office is directed to send down the record at once.<br/>        <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
