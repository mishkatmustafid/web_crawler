The two provisions have only to be looked at by side to be sure that more people can now be called public servants for the purposes of the anti-corruption law. The word “any” as </strong><strong>mentioned in section 2(b) included “all” or “every”</strong><strong> as well as “some” or “one” depending on the context of the subject matter of the statute. The word “any” used in section 2(b) has diversity and may be employed to indicate “all” or “every” as well as “some” or “one”. The word “body” as used in section 2(b) means a number individually spoken of collectively, usually associated for a common purpose, joined in a certain cause or united by some common tie or occupation.          . . .

They are public servants since they held office by virtue of which they were authorized or required to perform public duty. The word “office” has been used in Articles 3 and 3D of P.O.28 of 1973 meaningfully. It can be said that there is complete departure from Penal Code and Act II of 1947. All those provisions are to be applicable for “any person” who committed the offences mentioned therein. Act has been enacted with the specific object of altering the existing anti-Corruption laws </strong><strong>so as to make them more effective by widening</strong><strong> their coverage and by strengthening the provisions and also </strong><strong>to widen the scope of the definition of “public</strong><strong> servant”. Those persons should be tried by the Special Judge.

No. 40 of 2007 corresponding to Kotwali Police Station Case No.68 dated 30.05.2007 under section 409/104 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 ( Act II of 1947). In the said petition, he sought for direction upon the writ respondent Nos.1-3 to accept customs duty and penal demand made by the writ respondent No.3 dated 05.11.2007 pursuant to adjudication order No. 1033 dated 05.11.2007 passed by the writ respondent No.2 and also challenged the continuation of the aforesaid criminal case stating, inter alia, that he was Member of Parliament for the term of 2001-2006. Taking privilege given by S.R.O No.266-Ain/2005/2098/ Shulka 22.08.2005 he imported Lexus-LX 470-model, UZJIOOR-GNAGK1, Japan origin Jeep under L/C. No.16825010037 dated 21.08.2005 giving undertaking pursuant to the certificate issued by the Speaker of Parliament. Thereafter, the writ respondent No.2 issued a show cause notice on 26.09.2007 to the writ petitioner asking him as to why legal action should not be taken against him for illegal transfer of the said jeep. The writ respondent No.2 by an order dated 05.11.2007 demanded duty of taka 51,00,000/- from the writ petitioner. The writ respondent No.3 issued another notice on 05.11.2007 demanding duty and penalty amounting to tk.148,76,068,96/- from him. Thereafter, on 30.05.2007, a Deputy Director of Anti-Corruption Commission lodged a First Information Report which was registered as Kotwali Police Station Case No.68 dated 30.05.2007 under Section 409/109 of the Penal Code stating that the writ petitioner transferred the aforesaid tax free Jeep to accused Abdul Jabbar Miah before the expiry of four years from the date of importation of the said Jeep violating the provision of law and thereby committed offence. Holding investigation, Anti-Corruption Commission submitted Chargesheet against the writ petitioner under the aforesaid provisions of law and accordingly impugned proceeding was started. The writ petitioner, challenging the said proceeding, filed the instant writ petition in the High Court Division and obtained Rule. The High Court Division made the said Rule absolute by the impugned judgment and order. Thus, the Anti-Corruption Commission has filed this appeal getting the leave.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts of Civil Appeal No.03 of 2009, in short, are that the respondent No.1 filed Writ Petition No.8578 of 2007 challenging the proceeding of Special Case No. 15 of 2007 arising out of Pallabi Police Station Case No. 37 dated 17.03.2007 under section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 read with Section 409/420 of the Penal Code and Section 156 of the Customs Act. One Md.Younus Ali, Sub- Inspector of Police, lodged a First Information Report with Pallabi Police Station against the writ petitioner stating, inter alia, that at about 13.15 hours on 05.03.2007 members of RAB-2 found a black Hummer Jeep bearing registration No. Dhaka Metro-Gha-11-6195 at the basement-1 of the UTC building. They asked about the ownership of the said Jeep and came to know that the owner of the Jeep was one Enayetur Rahman. Then the RAB personnel asked Enayetur Rahman to appear before the RAB-2 on 06.03.2007 who met the officials of RAB-2 and produced documents in support of his claim of Jeep but finding inconsistencies in the documents, RAB-2 arrested him and seized the Jeep. Writ petitioner Harun-or-Rashid imported the said Jeep under M.P. quota and transferred the same to Enayetur Rahman by showing lesser price than that of market price. The Anti-Corruption Commission holding investigation, submitted charge sheet against the writ petitioner and others under the aforesaid provisions of law. The Metropolitan Special Judge, Dhaka took cognizance of the offence and, thereafter, transferred the case before the Special Judge, Court No.4, Dhaka where the case was registered as Special Case No.15 of 2007. At the stage of examination of witnesses, the writ petitioner filed the instant writ petition in the High Court Division and obtained Rule. The High Court Division ultimately made the said Rule absolute. Thus, the Anti-Corruption Commission has filed this appeal getting leave.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts of Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 421 of 2012, in short, are that the respondent Obaidul Karim filed an application under Section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the High Court Division challenging the proceeding of Special Case No.13 of 2008 corresponding to Metropolitan Special Case No.120 of 2008 arising out of Tejgaon Police Station Case No.17(8) of 2007 under section 409/109 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. One Abdul Karim, Deputy Director of Anti-Corruption Commission lodged a First Information Report with Tejgaon Police Station against the respondent No.1 stating that Mr. Saidul Haque, Member of Parliament, imported an Infinity Jeep from the U.S.A. opening L/C. No.133505010254 dated 04.05.2005 under M.P. quota. Said Md. Saidul Hauqe used the address of Orion group, House No. 153-154, Tejgaon Industrial Area, Dhaka. On the date of opening L/C, the respondent No.1, through his employee deposited taka 5,00,000/- in the account of Md. Saidul Haque. After receiving the said Jeep, said Md. Saidul Haque gave undertaking stating that he would not transfer the Jeep during the tenure of his membership in Parliament or before expiry of three years from the date of importation. Before delivery of the said Jeep, the respondent No.1 deposited taka 40,00,000/- in the account of Md. Saidul Haque through an employee of Orion Laboratory Limited. Md. Saidul Haque, in collusion with respondent No.1, misappropriated taka 85,50,680/- transferring the said jeep to respondent No.1 thereby they committed offence. The Anti-Corruption Commission, holding investigation, submitted charge sheet against the respondent No.1 and others under the aforesaid provisions of law. The case was transferred before the Special Judge, Court No.8, Dhaka for holding trial. Challenging the said proceeding, the respondent No.1 filed the instant application under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the High Court Division and obtained Rule. The High Court Division by the impugned judgment and order dated 16.6.2011 made the Rule absolute, thereby, quashed the proceeding. Thus the Anti-Corruption Commission has filed this criminal petition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General with Mr. Khorshed Alam Khan appeared on behalf of the appellant and the petitioner in all the cases. On the other hand, Mr. Shah Manjurul Haque, learned Advocate appeared for the respondent No.1 in Criminal Appeal No.68 of 2009 and Mr. Mvi.Md. Wahidullah, learned Advocate-on-Record on behalf of the respondent No.1 in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 421 of 2012.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The submissions of the learned Attorney General in all the cases are same, those are, the respondents have committed offences within the meaning of sections 409/109 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act by transferring or purchasing the tax free Jeep before expiry of prescribed time limit. He submits that since the prima-facie cases against the respondents have been made out under the aforesaid provisions of law, the High Court Division erred in law in making the Rules absolute. He submits that the writ petition Nos.9905 of 2007 and 8578 of 2007 against the Criminal proceedings were not maintainable since Criminal Procedure Code provides efficacious remedy to get redress against such types of proceedings if the writ petitioners feel themselves aggrieved. He further submits that members of Parliament are public servants in view of the provisions of Section 21 of Penal Code read with Section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Shah Manjurul Haque, learned Advocate appearing for the respondent No.1, in Civil Appeal No.68 of 2008 and Mvi. Md. Wahidullah, learned Advocate-on-Record in Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.421 of 2012 submit that the respondents being Members of Parliament were not Public Servants, so initiation of criminal proceedings under Sections 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act read with Section 409/109 of the Penal Code against them were bad in law, the High Court Division rightly passed the impugned judgments.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts and relevant laws related to the cases are identical. The High Court Division quashed the proceedings mainly on the ground that the Members of Parliament are not Public Servant within the meaning of the expression in any of the clauses of Section 21 of the Penal Code and Section 2(b) of the prevention of Corruption Act, so the initiations of proceedings against them under Sections 409/109 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 were bad in law. The High Court Division relied on the decision in the case of R.S. Nayek Vs. A.R. Antulay reported in AIR 1984 SC 684=(1984) 2 SCC 183. In the cited case it was observed that MLA was not and is not a “public servant” within the meaning of the expression in any of the clauses of Section 21 IPC. It was further observed that MLA does not perform public duty but he discharges constitutional functions and thus he is not a public servant. In the case Ramesh Balkrishna Kulkarni Vs. State of Maharashtra (AIR 1985)SC 1655 Indian Supreme Court further held that a public servant is an authority who must be appointed by Government or a semi government body and should be in the pay or salary of the same, secondly, a “public servant” is to discharge his duties in accordance with the rules and regulation made by the Government.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The relevant expressions regarding the definition of Public Servant are:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Section 21. Public Servant: The words “Public Servant” denote a person falling under any description hereinafter following namely:-<br/>:Twelfth-every person-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">in the service or pay of the Government or remunerated by the Government by fees or commissions for the performance of any public duty;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">in the service or pay of a local authority or of a corporation, body or authority established by or under any law or of a firm or company in which any part of the interest or share capital is held by, or vested in the Government.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Explanation 1- persons falling under any of the above descriptions are public servants, whether appointed by the Government or not.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Haque submits that an M.P. occupies in the Parliament as has been referred to as “seat” instead of “office” in part V. Chapter 1 of the Constitution. They do not hold any “office” and that they do not get any salaries. So they are not “Public servant”.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It would not be out of place to reproduce the related provisions regarding financial benefits provided in law for the members of Parliament.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Article 68 of the Constitution provides-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Remuneration etc. of members of Parliament- Members of Parliament shall be entitled to such remuneration, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Act of Parliament or, until so determined, by order made by the President.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">14. In Bengali version of Article 68 of the Constitution the word “remuneration” has been translated as “<strong><em>cvwikªwgK</em></strong>”. In the case of Accountant General, Bihar Vs. N. Bakshi reported in AIR (1962) SC 505 Indian Supreme Court held that if a man gives his services, whatever consideration he gets for giving his services is a remuneration for him. Consequently, if a person was in receipt of a payment, or in receipt of a percentage, or any kind of payment which would not be actual money payment, the amount he would receive annually in respect of this would be remuneration. The Supreme Court of India relied upon in In R Vs. Postmaster General, (1986) 1QBD658 where Justice Backburn observed, “I think the word “remuneration” ----- as a quid pro quo”. It is a wider term than salary.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There is no definition of “remuneration” in the Constitution, but that is not a ground for holding that the expression is used in any limited sense as merely salary. The expression “remuneration” in its ordinary connotation means “reward”, recompense pay, wages or salary for service render. It is payment for services rendered or work done. In S &amp; V Stores Ltd. V. Lee, (1969)2 All Er 417, 419 (QBD) it was observed that “remuneration” is not mere payment for work done, but is what the doer expects to get as the result of the work he does in so far as what he expects to get is quantified in terms of money.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The mere fact that the position which an M.P. occupies in the Parliament has been referred to as “seat” instead of office is not a sure indicium of the fact that an M.P. is not a “public servant” and it would not be proper to place reliance thereupon for the conclusion of the fact that an M.P. is not a “Public servant”. It is true that in the Constitution Member of Parliament has been referred to as a person who holds “seat” of Parliament. But the words “seat” and “Office” are interchangeable terms and either of them can be used while referring to a member of Parliament.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The term “office” has been defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, in the following words:- “Duty attaching to one’s station, position or employment; a duty service, or charge, falling or assigned to one; a service or task to be performed; A position or place to which certain duties are attached, especially one of a more or less public character, a position of trust, authority, or service under constituted authority; a place in the administration of Government, the public service, the direction of a corporation, company, society etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The word, “office” has got the following meaning as given to it in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words &amp; Phrases.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“In any case, an office necessary implies that there is some duty to be performed”.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Blackstone defined an “office” as “a right to exercise a public or private employment, and to take the fees and employments thereunto belonging.” Cockburn C.J. thought that “an office necessarily implies that there is some duty to be performed.” The formulation of Rowlatt J. has frequently been endorsed in the House of Lords “---- an office or employment which was a subsisting, permanent, substantive position which had an existence independent of the person who filled it, and which went on and was filled in succession by successive holders.----“</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The word “office” has been defined in Black’s Law Dictionary, an “assigned duty” or “function”. Synonyms are “post” ,”appointment” , “situation”, “place”, “position”, and “office” commonly suggests a position of (especially public) trust or authority.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The word “Office” is of indefinite content. One of its various meanings is a position or place to which certain duties are attached, especially one of a more or less Public Character (Rajendra Shankar Tripathi V. State of U.P,1979 Cr.LJ 243) Black’s Law Dictionary further defines office” as right, and correspondent duty, to exercise a public trust. The most frequent occasions to use the word “office” arise with reference to a duty and power conferred on an individual by the Government, and when this is the connection, “Public Office” is a usual and more discriminating expression. But a power and duty may exist without immediate grant from government, and may be properly called an “office”. Public office defines as, “The right, authority, and duty created and conferred by law, by which for a given period, either fixed by law or enduring at the pleasure of the creating power, an individual is invested with some portion of the sovereign functions of Government for the benefit of the public. An agency for the state, the duties of which involve in their performance the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power either great or small.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The term “office” has also been a subject matter of interpretation in American Jurisprudence, in following manner;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“........ Ordinarily and generally, a public office is defined to be the right, authority, and duty created and conferred by law, the tenure of which is not transient, occasional, or incidental, by which for a given period an individual is invested with power to perform a public function for the benefit of the public. The position is an office whether the incumbent is selected by appointment or by election and whether he is appointed during the pleasure of the appointing power or is elected or a fixed term.”<br/>“A public officer is such an officer as is required by law to be elected or appointed, who has a designation or title given him by law, and who exercises functions concerning the public assigned to him by law”.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Grahm Zellic in an article “Bribery of Members of Parliament and the Criminal Law” published in Public Law, 1979, has cited the observations of Sir Issac J, which are in the following words:-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“When a man becomes a Member of Parliament, he undertakes high public duties. Those duties are inseparable from the position; he cannot retain the honour and divest himself of the duties. The position, independent of the Member, is subsisting, permanent and substantive and will be filled by others after him; this is provided by law; and it is certainly of a more, rather than less, public character, Erskine May in fact speaks of “Corruption in the Execution of their office as Members. There is nothing to stop a Court, therefore, holding that membership of Parliament constitutes an office........”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Taking into consideration the above quoted definitions and observations, the Delhi High Court in the case of L.K. Advani V. Central Bureau of Investigation reported 1997 Cri.L.J.2559 has observed:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Let us now see as to whether an M.P. holds an office? Admittedly, an M.P. enjoys a status and position. He is also required to perform public duties under the Constitution. Thus it can be safely concluded therefrom that a Member of Parliament is holder of an office.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In R.V. Whitaker (1914-3KB.1283) it was held, “A public officer is an officer who discharges any duty in the discharge of which the public are interested, more clearly so if he is paid out of a fund provided by the public. If taxes go supply his payment and the public have an interest in the duties be discharges, he is a public officer”.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Best C.J. in Henly V. Mayor of Lyme, (1928)5 Bing 91, to the view that “--- every one who is appointed to discharge a public, duty, and receives a compensation in whatever shape, whether from the crown or otherwise, is constituted a public officer------ It seems to me that --- if a man takes a reward- Whatever be the nature of that reward, whether it be in money from the crown, whether it be in land from the crown, whether it be “ in lands or money from any individual, - for the discharge of a public duty, that instant he becomes a public officer ---“</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Well discussed case in this regard is the case of P.V. Narashima Rao Vs. State (CBI/SPE) reported in (1998) 4 SCC page 626. In that case, facts, in short, were that, in the General Election for the Tenth LokSabha held in 1991 the Congress (I) party emerged as the single largest party and it formed the Government with P.V.Narasimha Rao as Prime Minister. On 26-7-1993, a motion of no confidence was moved in the Lok Sabha against the minority Government of P.V. Narasimha Rao. The support of 14 Members was needed to have the no-confidence motion defeated. On 28-7-1993, the no-confidence motion was lost, 251 Members having voted in support and 265 against. Suraj Mandal, Shibu Soren, Simon Marandi and Shailendra Mahto, Members of the Lok Sabha owning allegiance to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (the JMM), and Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav, Ram Sharan Yadav, Roshan Lal, Anadicharan Das, Abhay Pratap Singh and Haji Gulam Mohammed, Members of the Lok Sabha owning allegiance to the Janata Dal, Ajit Singh group (the JD, AS), voted against the no-confidence motion. Ajit Singh, a Member of the Lok Sabha owning allegiance to the JD, AS, abstained from voting thereon. One Shri Ravindra Kumer of Rashtriya Mukti Morcha filed a complaint dated 1-2-1996 with the “CBI” wherein it was alleged that in July 1993 a criminal conspiracy was hatched pursuant to which the above –named Members agreed to and did receive bribes, to the giving of which P.V. Narasimha Rao, MP &amp; Prime Minister, Satish Sharma, MP &amp; Minister, Buta Singh, MP. V. Rajeshwara Rao, MP, N.M. Revanna, Ramalinga Reddy, MLA, M.Veerappa Moily, MLA &amp; Chief Minister, State of Karnataka, D.K. Adikeshavulu, M. Thimmegowda and Bhajan Lal, MLA &amp; Chief Minister, State of Haryana, were parties, to vote against the no-confidence motion. A prosecution being launched against the aforesaid alleged bribe-givers and bribe takers subsequent to the vote upon the no-confidence motion, cognizance was taken by the Special Judge, Delhi. The persons sought to be charged as aforesaid filed petitions in the High Court at Delhi seeking to quash the charges. By the judgment and order under challenge, the High Court dismissed the petitions. They preferred appeals. The appeals were heard by a Bench of three learned Judges and then referred to a Constitution Bench. The argument on behalf of the appellants to be considered by the Constitution Bench, broadly put, was that by virtue of the provisions of Article 105, members of Parliament are immune from the prosecution and that, in any event, they cannot be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Relevant portions of the majority view of the cited case was as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“We will first examine the question whether a Member of Parliament holds an office. The word “office” is normally understood to mean “a position to which certain duties are attached, especially a place of trust, authority or service under constituted authority. In Macmillan V. Guest Lord Wright has said:<br/>The word “office” is a indefinite content. Its various meanings cover four columns of the New English Dictionary, but I take as the most relevant for purposes of this case the following: “ A position or place to which certain duties are attached, especially one of a more or less public character.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Lord Atkin gave the following meaning:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">an office or employment which was subsisting, permanent, substantive position, which had an existence independent of the person who filled it, which went on and was filled in succession by successive holders.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Lord Wright said:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">An office means no more than a position to which certain duties are attached.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In R.V. White, 13 SCR (NSW) 332 the Supreme court of New South Wales has held that a Member of the State Legislature holds an office. That view has been affirmed by the High Court of Australia in Boston (1923) 33 CLR 386. Issacs and Rich, JJ.said:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">A Member of Parliament is, therefore, in the highest sense, a servant of the State; his duties are those appertaining to the position he fills, a position of no transient or temporary existence, a position forming a recognized place in the constitutional machinery of government. Why, then, does he not hold an “office’? In R. V. White it was held, as a matter of course, that he does. A person authoritatively appointed or elected to exercise some function pertaining to public life. “Clearly a Member of Parliament is a “public officer” in a very real sense, for he has, in the words of Williams, J.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In Habibullah Khan V. State of Orissa (1993 Cr.L.J 3604) the Orissa High Court has held that a Member of the Legislative Assembly holds an office and performs a public duty. The learned Judges have examined the matter keeping in view the meaning given to the expression “office” by Lord Wright as well as by Lord Atkin in McMillan V. Guest (1942 AC 561).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The next question is whether a Member of Parliament is authorized or required to perform any public duty by virtue of his office. In R.S. Nayak V. A.R. Antulay Supreme Court of India has said that though a Member of the State Legislature is not performing any public duty either directed by the Government or for the Government but he no doubt performs public duties cast on him by the Constitution and by his electorate and he discharges constitutional obligations for which he is remunerated fees under the Constitution.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In P.V. Narashima Rao’s case it was further observed that under the Constitution M.P is responsible to Parliament and act as watchdogs on the functioning of the Council of Ministers. In addition, a Member of Parliament plays an important role in parliamentary proceedings, including enactment of legislation, which is a sovereign function. The duties discharged by him are such in which the State, the public and the community at large have an interest and the said duties are, therefore, public duties. It can be said that a Member of Parliament is authorised and required by the Constitution to perform these duties and the said duties are performed by him by virtue of his office.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Issac, J., (1920)-27CLR 494, has further said:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“One of the duties is that of watching on behalf of the general community the conduct of the executive, of criticising it, and if necessary, of calling it to account in the constitutional way by censure from his place in Parliament- censure which, if sufficiently supported, means removal from office. That is the whole essence of responsible government, which is the keystone of our political system, and is the main constitutional safeguard the community possess.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In R.V Boston (1923) 33 CLR 386 it was further observed that the fundamental obligation of a Member in relation to Parliament of which he is a constituent unit still subsists as essentially as at any period of our history. That fundamental obligation which is the key to this case is the duty to serve and, in serving, to act with fidelity and with a single-mindedness for the welfare of the community.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Those duties are of a transcendent nature and involve the greatest responsibility, for they include the supreme power of moulding the laws to meet the necessities of the people, and the function of vigilantly controlling and faithfully guarding the public finances.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In P.V. Narashima Rao’s the Supreme Court of India finally observed:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“1. A. Member of Parliament does note enjoy immunity under Article 105(2) or under Article 105(3) of the Constitution from being prosecuted before a criminal court for an offence involving offer or acceptance of bribe for the purpose of speaking or by giving his vote in Parliament or in any committees thereof.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"> A Member of Parliament is a public servant under Section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> Since there is no authority competent to remove a Member of Parliament and to grant sanction for his prosecution under Section 19(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the court can take cognizance of the offences mentioned in Section 19(1) in the absence of sanction but till provision is made by Parliament in that regard by suitable amendment in the law, the prosecuting agency, before filing a charge-sheet in respect of an offence punishable under section 7, 10, 11, 13 and  of the 1988 Act against a Member of Parliament in a criminal court, shall obtain the permission of the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha/Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the case may be.”</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Indian Supreme Court lastly held, “Having considered the submissions of the learned Counsel on the meaning of the expression “public servant” contained in section 2 (c) of the 1988 Act we are of the view that a Member of Parliament is a Public Servant for the purpose of the 1988 Act.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Relevant provision provides in Section 2(b) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XL of 1958) regarding expanded definition of “public servant” is as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">2. Definitions- In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context-<br/>(a)-------<br/>(a)(a)----<br/>(b)”Public servant” means a public servant as defined in section 21 of the Penal Code and includes a Chairman, Director, Trustee, Member, Commissioner, Officer or other employee of any local authority, statutory corporation or body corporate or of any other body or organisation constituted or established under any law;’</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">There can be no doubt that coverage of section 2(b) of Act XL of 1958 is far wider than that of section 21 of the Penal Code. The two provisions have only to be looked at by side to be sure that more people can now be called public servants for the purposes of the anti-corruption law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Realising the importance of honesty and probity in public life and to weed out the corruption rampant amongst the Public servants, the legislators thought it fit and proper to frame a comprehensive legislation in the form of Anti-corruption Commission Act (Act-V of 2004). Before that they provided the above mentioned expanded definition of “Public servant” substituting 2(b) quoted above in Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 by the Ordinance No.VI of 1978.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the expanded definition of the public servant, the legislators, amongst others, added, “a------ Member..... of any other body”.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The word “any” as mentioned section 2(b) included “all” or “every” as well as “some” or “one” depending on the context of the subject matter of the statute. The word “any” used in section 2(b) has diversity and may be employed to indicate “all” or “every” as well as “some” or “one”. The word “body” as used section 2(b) means a number individually spoken of collectively, usually associated for a common purpose, joined in a certain cause or united by some common tie or occupation. The parliament is a legislative body which is a creation of the Constitution itself. The main function of parliament is law making, that is, legislative. Earlier a member of the parliament had no specific function as to the custody, receipt or disbursement of any public money. But, today, that is not whole true. There is little change of the situation. It would not be irrelevant here to give some examples regarding activities of the members of Parliament. For example: <strong><em>Ò</em></strong><strong>Probidhan 5 of</strong> <strong><em>মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক শিক্ষা বোর্ড, ঢাকা (মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক</em></strong><strong>  <em>বেসরকারী শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের গভর্নিং বডি ও ম্যানেজিং কমিটি) প্রবিধানমালা, ২০০৯ </em>ঢ়ৎড়ারফবং-<em> ৫। গভর্নিং বডির সভাপতি মনোয়ন।-(১) কোন স্থানীয় নির্বাচিত সংসদ সদস্য তাঁহার নির্বাচনী এলাকায় অবসিহত বোর্ড কর্তৃক স্বীকৃতি প্রাপ্ত এমন সংখ্যক উচ্চ মাধ্যমিক সত্মরের বেসরকারী শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের গভর্নিং বডির সভাপতির দায়িত্ব গ্রহন করিতে পারিবেন যেন উক্ত এলাকায় অবসিহত, এই প্রবিধান মামলার আওতাভুক্ত নহে এইরূপ অন্যান্য বেসরকারী শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানসহ তাঁহার এইরপূ দায়িত্ব গ্রহনকৃত শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের সংখ্যা চার এর অধিক না হয়।’’ </em></strong>Similarly Section 25 of the<strong><em> উপজেলা পরিষদ আইন, ১৯৯৮ </em></strong>ঢ়ৎড়ারফবং <em>২৫<strong>। পরিষদের উপদেষ্টা ।-(১) গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশের সংবিধানের অনুচ্ছেদ ৬৫ এর অধীন একক আঞ্চলিক এলাকা হইতে নির্বাচিত সংশিস্নষ্ট সংসদ সদস্য পরিষদের উপদেষ্টা হইবেন এবং পরিষদ উপদেষ্টার পরামর্শ গ্রহন করিবে।’’</strong></em> There are instances of the activities of the members of Parliament which are related to the executive functions of the State and money disbursement. By different ways the members of Parliament involved themselves in executive functions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As per provision of Article 3 of P.O. No.28 of 1973 a Member shall be entitled to receive a remuneration at the rate of twenty seven thousand and five hundred take per mensem and to the privileges and amenities provided in the order during the whole of his term of office. That is, the Members of Parliament received remuneration from the government during the whole of his term in office. Article 3C(1) of P.O.28 of 1973 provides that a member shall be, entitled to import free of customs duty, value added tax, development surcharge and import permit fee during the whole of his term of office, one car, jeep or microbus of such specification, and on such conditions, as the Government may specify in this behalf. Article 3CC says, “A member shall be entitled to receive a transport allowance at the rate of forty thousand take per mensem. Article 3D provides:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“A member shall be entitled to receive office expenses allowance at the rate of nine thousand taka per mensem for maintaining an office in his constituency. A member shall also get laundry and miscellaneous expenses allowances, allowances relating to journey performed for the purposes of attending a session, daily allowances travel allowance within the country, insurance coverage, discretionary grant, medical facilities for family members etc.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The oath that they took referred to their obligation to “faithfully discharge the duty” upon which they were about to enter. They are public servants since they held office by virtue of which they were authorized or required to perform public duty. The word “office” has been used in Articles 3 and 3D of P.O.28 of 1973 meaningfully.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, regarding the object of legislation of Anti-corruption Act as stated in the preamble is: <strong>Ò</strong><strong><em>দেশে দুর্নীতি এবং দুর্নীতিমুলক কার্য প্রতিরোধের লক্ষ্যে দুর্নীতি এবং্যান্যঅন সুনির্দিষ্ট অপরাধের অনুসন্ধান</em></strong><strong> <em>এবং তদমত্ম পরিচালনার জন্য একটি স্বাধীন দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশন প্রতিষ্ঠা এবং আনুষাঙ্গিক বিষয়াদি সম্পর্কে বিধানকল্পে প্রনীত আইন যেহেতু দেশে দুর্নীতি এবং দুর্নীতিমুলক কার্য প্রতিরোধের লক্ষ্যে দুর্নীতি এবং অন্যাুনির্দিষ্ট্যস অপরাধের অনুসন্ধান এবং তদমত্ম পরিচালনার জন্য একটি স্বাধীন দুর্নীতি দমন কমিশন প্রতিষ্ঠা এবং আনুষাঙ্গিক বিষয়াদি সম্পর্কে বিধান করা সমীচীন ও প্রয়োজনীয়।’’</em></strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the schedule of the ACC Act section, 161 and 409 of the Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 have been included objectively.

All those provisions are to be applicable for “any person” who committed the offences mentioned therein. Act has been enacted with the specific object of altering the existing anti-Corruption laws so as to make them more effective by widening their coverage and by strengthening the provisions and also to widen the scope of the definition of “public servant”. Those persons should be tried by the Special Judge.

The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and Anti Corruption Commission Act and Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 are the enactments which are meant for the benefit of the public. The main aim of those Acts are eradiction of the Corruption which is permeating every nook and corner of the country. Corruption by public servants has now reached a monstrous demension in Bangladesh. Its tentacles have been grappling even the institutions established for the protection of the State. Those must be intercepted and impeded the orderly functions of the public officer, through strong legislative, executive as well as judicial exercises the corrupt public servants could even paralyze the functioning of such institutions and thereby hinder the democratic polity. Hence, the laws should be so interpreted which would serve the object of the Acts. The founding fathers of the Constitution envisioned the legislators as men of character, rectitude and moral uprightness whose sole object was to serve the public with dedication, to be open, truthful and legal. We are reminded here of the memorable words of H.G. Wells. He was of the view:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The true strength of rulers and empires lies not in armies or emotions, but in the belief of men that they are inflexibly open and truthful and legal. As soon as a Government departs from that standard, it ceases to be anything more than “the gang in possession” and its days are numbered.” Proliferation of corrupt public servants could garner momentum to cripple the social order if such men are allowed to continue to manage and operative public institution.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Franklen has said-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Let honesty be as the breath of they soul; then shall thou reach the point of happiness, and independence shall be they shield and buckle, they helmet and crown; then shall they soul walk upright, nor stoop to the silken wretch because he hath riches, nor pocket an abuse because the hand which officers it wears or ring set with diamonds”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Thomas Jefferson said-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The whole of Government consists in the art of being honest.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">J.A.G Griffith in “Parliament” Functions, practice and procedure, has cited Edmund Bruke while Commentina on the functions of the Members of Parliament. Accordingly to him, “It ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication, with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him, their opinion, high respect, their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions to theirs- and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living----------your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to yours opinion.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Raja Ram Pal V.

Advani’s case (supra) it was finally observed, “Now each and every person who holds an office by virtue of which he is required to perform any public duty in the discharge of which the State, public or the community at large is interested would be deemed to be a ‘public servant’. It is no more necessary that to be a “public servant” the said person must be in the pay of the Government or remunerated for the performance of any public duty by the Government.” In fact, in India finally the controversy has been settled in the case of P.V.Narsimha Rao (Supra) in which it has been observed that Member of Parliament is a public servant for the purpose of Prevention of Corruption Act.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We are, therefore, of the view that a member of Parliament holds an office and by virtue of such office he is required or authorized to carry out duties and such duties are in the nature of public duties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Another important aspect is that challenging the proceedings of Special cases writ Petition No.9905 of 2007 and 8578 of 2007 are not maintainable inasmuch as Code of Criminal Procedure provides efficacious remedy to get redress if one feels himself aggrieved due to initiation of such criminal proceedings. In such view of the matter those two writ petitions were not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether the accused respondents have committed any offence within the meaning of section 409/109 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 or not are to be decided after recording evidence by the trial Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of such circumstances, we find substance in the submissions made by Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, we find merit in the appeals as well as in civil petition. Thus the judgment and order dated 14.02.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.9905 of 2007, judgment and order dated 18.05.2008 passed by the High Court Division in Writ Petition No.8578 of 2007 and judgment and order dated 16.06.2011 passed by the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.10340 of 2011 are set aside.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         Consequently, C.A. 68 of 2009 and C.A. No.03 of 2009 are allowed. The Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 421 of 2012 is hereby disposed of. The respective trial Court are directed to proceed with the respective proceedings in accordance with law.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

This application was partially allowed by this Court vide order dated 23.03.2015. By that order dated 23.03.2015, the suit was allowed to be non-prosecuted/ withdrawn, and by the same order this Court fixed 05.04.2015 for necessary orders as regards the prayer of the plaintiff for refund of the Court fees. Consequently, after deferments, the issue of refund of the Court fees will now be deposed of by this order.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The aforesaid Admiralty Suit No. 17 of 2015 was originally filed by the plaintiff on 12.03.2015 along with the highest Court fee of Tk. 1,00,000.00 (one lac) as per the provisions of the  Admiralty Court Act, 2000 (“the said Act”) and the applicable Rules, namely Admiralty Rules, 1912. It appears from record that though the suit was filed claiming compensation for short-landing, the plaintiff did not press for admission of the suit and as such neither the same was admitted by any order of this Court and nor any notices were issued on the defendants. Before such formal admission of the Suit, the plaintiff has come up with the aforesaid application for non-prosecution/withdrawal of the same and for refund of the Court fees. In support of the application for refund of the Court fees, the plaintiff mainly relies on the underlining principles of the provisions under Section 89-A, in particular sub-section (11) thereof, and Order 23, Rule-1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. M.A. Hannan, learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-applicant, has made the following submissions in support of the plaintiff’s prayer for refund of the Court fees:	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li>Since sub-section (11) of Section 89-A of the Code of Civil Procedure has made it obligatory on the Court to issue certificate directing refund of the Court fee in case of settlement of dispute between the parties through mediation process, and such mediation process can be initiated after filing of the written statement by the defendants, in the present Admiralty Suit there is no bar in allowing refund of the Court fees inasmuch as that the instant suit has even not yet admitted by a formal order and no notices have been issued on the defendants;</li><li>Since Section 7 of the Admiralty Court Act, 2000 has made the provisions of the Court Fees Act, 1870 applicable, the refund of Court fees should be allowed in the instant case in view of the underlining principles of Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the said Court Fees Act.</li></ol></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In support of his above submissions, Mr. Hannan relies upon three decisions of our sub-continent, namely <strong>Bhola v. Sardar Muhammad,</strong><strong> PLD 1976 Lahore 1268, Jan Mohammad vs. </strong><strong>Amolak Ram, AIR 1936, Lahore 301, Krutibasa</strong><strong> Nayak vs. Sri Jagannath Mahapravu, AIR 1975, Orissa 211</strong>.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">To reach a conclusion as to whether the court fees in the instant suit at present stage can be refunded or not, we have examined the relevant provisions of the Admiralty Court Act, 2000, applicable Admiralty Rules, namely Admiralty Rules, 1912, relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as well as the Court Fees Act, 1870. We have also examined the corresponding provisions of the Original Side Rules of this Court as well as the Calcutta High Court (as amended time to time).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It must be noted at the very out-set that there is no specific provision for refund of Court Fees either in the said Admiralty Court Act, 2000 and the applicable Admiralty Rules, 1912. There is also no specific provision in the Admiralty Court Act, 2000 as to the applicability of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure except Section 6 of the said Act which provides that the presentation or filing of the plaint (j¡jm¡ l¤S¤) in the Admiralty Court shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. For all practical purposes, Admiralty Suits before the Admiralty Court in Bangladesh are now being preceeded and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the said Act of 2000 and the Admiralty Rules, 1912. While Rule 2 of the Admiralty Rules, 1912 has made the said Rules applicable to all suits instituted in the Admiralty Court, Rule 51 of the said Rules provides that in the absence of any provisions in the said Rules regarding any matter, the said Admiralty proceedings shall be regulated by the Rules and practice of the Court in suits brought in it in exercise of its ordinary Original Civil jurisdiction. Therefore, applicability of the Original Side Rules of this Court have been preserved by the provisions under Rule 51 of the Admiralty Rules, 1912 though the Letters Patent of 1865, under the authority of  which the said Original Side Rules were framed, have been repealled by the Law Reform Ordinance, 1978. This position of preservation of the Original Side Rules as well as the application of the provisions of the Code of Civ il Procedure in absence of specific provisions in the said Act of 2000 and the Rules of 1912 has been confirmed by this Court in two earlier decisions, namely <strong>King Shipping Trading Company vs. M/S. L.S. Lines and others, 1986 BLD-117 and Multcargo Limited vs. M.V. Poul Barcelona and others, 2 L.G. (2005)-287. </strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, in the said Original Side Rules (as we have examined), this Court has not found any specific provision as to the refund of the Court Fees. In such a situation, Rule 61 of the Admiralty Rules 1912 provides the this Admiralty Court has inherent power to make orders under the Ordinary Rules and practice in the absence of the specific provisions in the above mentioned Act and Rules.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keeping in mind the above position, let us now examine the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as well as the Court Fees Act, 1870. It appears from Section 89A of the Code, in particular sub-section (11), that in case of mediation under the supervision of the Court, or by the Court, after submission of written statements by the defendants, it has been made incumbent upon the Court to issue certificate allowing refund of the court fees in favour of the concerned parties. Sub-section (13) of Section 89A of the Code also recognizes the right of the plaintiff to withdraw the suit at any stage under the provisions of the Order 23 of the Code. It further appears that in view of the provisions under Rule-1 of Order 23, a plaintiff is allowed to simply withdraw the suit without any condition. In which case, he will not be permitted to file the suit afresh with the same cause of action. However, in view of the provisions under Rules 2 and 3 of Order 23, if the said suit is withdrawn with a permission of the Court to file the same afresh for any formal defect or any other reasons, the Court may impose condition or costs on the plaintiff. In the instant Admiralty Suit, we are dealing with the former situation which is that a plaintiff has simply withdrawn the suit even before admission of the same. This Court is of the view that the conditions as mandated under Rules-2 and 3 of Order 23 of the Code will not apply here as this situation only relates to simple withdrawal of the suit without any entitlement of the plaintiff to file the same afresh.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now, since Section 7 of the Admiralty Court Act, 2000 has made provisions of the Court Fees Act, 1870 applicable, we may take recourse to the relevant provisions of refund of the Court fees as provided under Sections 13-15 of the said Court Fees Act. The  underlining principles of the said provisions are that the parties are entitled to refund of the Court fees if it is found that the apparatus of the Court and its process have not been used for the cause for which the parties have taken recourse to the proceedings of the Court. This underlining principle of the Court Fees Act as well as the provisions under sub-Section (11) of Section 89A of the Code have also been recognized and affirmed in the cases as referred to by Mr. Hannan, in particular the case of <strong>Bhola v. Sardar Muhammad, PLD 1976 Lahore 1268.</strong> In the said case, a Lahore Bench of the Pakistan High Court held that in the absence of specific provisions, the underlining principles of Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Court Fees Act can be taken recourse to in exercise of the inherent powers of the Court to refund the court fees. The situation before the Lahore Bench was withdrawal of an appeal which was only admitted and did not go further. In that case, the appellant was allowed to refund of court fees though that situation was not specifically covered by the provisions under Sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Court Fees Act. In the said Lahore Bench case, after examining several decisions of the superior courts on the point, the Court reached three major legal conclusions, namely-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“(i) The consensus of authorities is that sections 13, 14 and 15 of the Court Fees Act are not exhaustive on the question of the grounds for refund of court-fee; </em><br/><em>(ii) that the Court has inherent powers to refund the court fee; and </em><br/><em>(iii) that it is only discretionary with the Court to issue a refund certificate in its inherent jurisdiction. While exercising the discretion, some of the relevant factors which might be considered includes the length of proceedings vis-à-vis the proceedings and hearing of the matter ; the fault if any committed by any party ; and <u>the benefit, if any, derived by the party concerned through the filing of the proceedings”</u>.</em><br/>(Underlines supplied)</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">At the time of hearing of this issue, Mr. Hafizullah, learned senior counsel present in Court, has made submissions that in such a situation the Court should also take into consideration whether the party derived any benefit from filing the case itself.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, it appears that the suit was not even admitted formally and no notices were issued on the defendants. Therefore, so far as the record is concerned, the defendants did not have any knowledge of the suit. The settlement agreement, a copy of which has been furnished before this Court by the plaintiff, does not also make any reference to the instant suit. Therefore, we cannot hold that the plaintiff has derived any benefit from filing of the instant suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The provision of refund of Court fees though was not present in the Original Side Rules of this Court, which we inherited from the Calcutta High Court, the Calcutta High Court has subsequently in 1974 (vide Notification No. 44 published in the Calcutta Gazette part-1 dated 1<sup>st</sup> August, 1974) added a new Chapter, being Chapter VIA, to it’s Original Side Rules dealing with “Court Fees on Plaint Etc”. Rule- 8 of the said Chapter of the Calcutta High Court Original Said Rules provides as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“8. Where any order is made by the Court for refund of any Court-fees paid by a party or his advocate or advocate acting on the Original Side as the case may be, the Registrar shall grant a certificate in terms of the order made by the Court authorizing the party or his advocate or advocate acting on the Original Side to receive back from the Collector the amount directed by the Court to be refunded.” </em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, it appears that though in case of order of refund of the Court fees under Section 89A it was the Court to issue certificate, the Original Side Rules of the Calcuta High Court has adopted a procedure to issue such certificate by the Registrar authorizing the party or its advocate of the original side to receive back from the Collector the amount of the refunded Court fees.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, since in the instant Admiralty Suit, which has not even gone beyond just filing, by applying the underlining principles of Sections 13, 15 and 16 of the Court Fees Act, 1870 and Section 89A (11) of the Court of Civil Procedure, this Court is of the view that the plaintiff has not at all used the apparatus of this Court, it is entitled to get back the entire Court fees deposited by it, namely Tk. 1,00,000/-(one lac), in the Sonali Bank Limited, Supreme Court Branch, Dhaka through Chalan No. 20 dated 12.03.2015 and, accordingly, a certificate in this regard should be issued by the Registrar/Marshal of this Court in favour of the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of above legal position and circumstances of the case, we find substance in the application for refund of the Court fees and, accordingly, the same is allowed. Thus, the Registrar/Marshall of this Court is directed to issue a certificate for refund of the aforesaid Court Fees of Tk. 1,00,000/-(one lac) in favour of the plaintiff or its advocate acting on his behalf authorizing the plaintiff or his advocate to receive back from the Collector of Dhaka the said Court fees, namely Tk. 1,00,000/-(one lac), within 30(thirty) days from the date of issuance of such certificate.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Admiralty Suit No. 17 of 2015</strong></a></div></div></div></div>

The Company, in the reply to the show cause notice, while admitting some of the allegations, gave clarifications of the events and stated that they occurred due to some ‘unavoidable circumstances’. The Company never admitted that the alleged contraventions were wilful. The Commission concluded that the contraventions are wilful, but refrained from giving any reason in support of its finding. This is simply perverse and violates the requirements of section 22. The enquiry report was not supplied along with the show cause notice. Neither in the show cause notice nor in the impugned order fraud was alleged. Absence of a speaking order cannot be cured by an affidavit giving reasons which should have been in the order itself. Therefore, we do not find any substance and relevancy in the argument. The order of imposition of penalty as well as the order rejecting the review application suffer from non-application of mind and are violative of the provisions of section 22 of the Ordinance. They have also failed to meet the requirement of duty to give reasons, which a quasi-judicial body is entrusted with the task of passing an order adversely against an individual. The decisions of the Commission imposing penalty upon the petitioners are perverse and without any lawful authority, firstly, because, those are solely based on reply of the Company, although the Commission treated the same as admission without lifting the corporate veil, and secondly, the Commission did not assign reasons of its own in holding that the contraventions are wilful and thus, violated the requirements of section 22 of the Ordinance.    . . .

By letter dated 04.04.2012  (Annexure-C), the Company, in compliance of Rule 13(a) of the Securities and Exchange commission (Rights Issue) Rules, 2006 submitted a summary report of the subscription received against the offer stating that valid subscription received by the Company was Tk. 97,50,63,580.00 and that the unsubscribed amount to be offered to the underwriters was Tk. 180,77,61,020.00.<br/>By letter dated 22.04.2012 (Annexure-D), the Company requested for the consent of the Commission to credit the rights shares to the BO accounts of the subscribers who had deposited their subscription within the stipulated time. By letter dated 24.04.2012 (Annexure-D1), the Company requested for extension of time for payment of subscription by two sponsor directors, namely Mr. Kim Jong Suk (petitioner of WP No. 5745 of 2013) and Mrs. Shirin Faruk (petitioner of WP No. 5301 of 2013) and one sponsor shareholder, M.L.

However, the Commission did not immediately reply to the said letters and there was no consent of extension of time as requested.  <br/>By several letters, all dated 26.042012 (Annexure-E series), the Company requested the underwriters to take up the issue in respect of the unsubscribed portion of the offer, which they did by depositing with the Company’s account the required amounts to the extent of their respective underwriting commitments thus completing the subscription, and this was duly informed by the Company to the Commission by letter dated 15.05.2012.   <br/>By letters dated 22.05.2012, 05.06.2012 and 10.06.2012 (Annexure-F series), the Company informed the Commission of the overall subscription status of the rights issue, mentioning that the bankers to the issue, Bank Asia Ltd., had refused to accept in the relevant account deposit of the underwriters’ and sponsor shareholders’ subscription payments despite the Company’s requests, and  hence, the Company had arranged for the deposit of the said amount in separate accounts maintained with Shah Jalal Bank Ltd., Agrani Bank Ltd. and Bank Asia Ltd. The Company also informed the Commission that 3% tax on the premium amount totaling Tk. 4,17,42,370.00 had already been paid to the exchequer and provided the Commission with copies of bank statements regarding the deposit of subscription as well as copies of chalans evidencing payment of the tax. The Company requested the Commission to accord its approval to the crediting of the BO accounts of the subscribers with the rights shares. However, no such consent was immediately forthcoming.<br/>By order No. SEC/CI/RI-70/ 2011/448 dated 12.06.2012 (Annexure-G), the Commission appointed the respondent nos. 4 and 5 (Director and Deputy Director of the Commission) to conduct an enquiry regarding compliance of subscription status of the rights issue of the Company. By a letter dated 24.06.2012 (Annexure-G1), the respondent no. 4 sought certain information in this regard from the Company. In response, by letter dated 26.06.2012 (Annexure-G2) the Company provided the information requested.<br/>By letter No. SEC/CI/RI-70/ 2011/1406 dated 17.06.2012 (Annexure-H), the Commission consented to the deposit of the entire subscription money to the designated account of the rights issue maintained with Bank Asia Ltd.<br/>By a letter dated 28.06.2012 (Annexure-I), the Commission sought to know from all listed companies, including the Company, the status as to compliance with notification No. SEC/CMRRCD/ 2009-193/119/ Administration/34 dated 22.11.2011 regarding minimum holding of shares by sponsor shareholders.<br/>On 04.07.2012, two sponsor directors of the Company, namely, Mr. Kim Jong Suk and Mrs. Shirin Frauk and one sponsor shareholder of the same, namely, M.L. Dyeing Ltd. received several letters from the respondent no. 4 alleging that they had used the funds of the Company to subscribe to the shares. In reply, by a letter dated 07.07.2012, the Director, Finance and Secretary of the Company denied such allegation and asserted that the money had been paid by the said sponsor directors and shareholders from their own sources. Nonetheless, the Enquiry Officer was not satisfied with such explanation and sought further explanation from the said sponsor directors and shareholders by letters dated 15.07.2012, to which, however, no replies were given.<br/>By a letter dated 25.07.2012 (Annexure-K), the Commission accorded its consent to the crediting of rights shares to the general shareholders, but not to the sponsor directors or the underwriters.<br/>By a directive dated 20.09.2012 (Annexure-L), the Commission, in exercise of its powers under section 20A of the Securities and exchange Ordinance, 1969, directed that the sponsors and directors of the Company cannot transfer their shares until further order.<br/>Thereafter, by a show cause notice dated 23.09.2012 (Annexure-M), addressed to the Directors, Managing Director and secretary of the Company, the Commission informed of the submission of the report by the respondent no. 4 stating the contraventions/violations contained therein. The notice asked the recipients to show cause as to why appropriate action should not be taken against them under section 22 of the Ordinance, 1969 for the alleged contraventions and also notified of a personal hearing on 04.10.2012. The show cause notice did not, however, enclose copy of the enquiry report.<br/>On 04.10.2012, the Company, through its Secretary, gave a written reply to the said show cause notice (Annexure-N) and also appeared in the personal hearing. In the written reply, the Company gave its response to each of the alleged contraventions.<br/>By a letter dated 14.01.2013 (Annexure-O), the Commission, in exercise of its power under section 2CC of the Ordinance, 1969 reduced the size of the issue to Tk. 119,95,60,980.00,  and passed direction for transferring the excess amount from the account of Bank Asia to the Company.<br/>By two separate directives dated 23.01.2013 (Annexure-P and P1) issued under section 20A of the Ordinance, the Company was directed to remove the Managing Director and the Company Secretary and the latter was barred from holding office of any organization associated with the Commission for a period of 5 years.<br/>Finally, by the impugned orders, all dated 27.01.2013 (Annexure-A), the Commission stated that since the Company had admitted the alleged contraventions, it imposed the penalty upon the petitioners and directed for payment of the said penalty amount within 15 (Fifteen) days.<br/>The petitioners made applications to the Commission under section 26(2) of the Ordinance, 1969 on 13.02.2013 (Annexure-Q) for reviewing the aforesaid orders.<br/>The Commission rejected the petitioners’ review applications vide the second impugned orders, all dated 07.04.2013 (Annexure-A1), without conducting any hearing of the said applications.<br/>In the supplementary affidavit, it has been stated that with respect to the self same allegations as made in the proceedings against the petitioners, the Commission also proceeded against the Company <em>i.e.</em> R.N. Spinning Mills Ltd. under section 22 of the Ordinance, 1969  and imposed a penalty of Tk. 10,00,000/- by order No. SEC/ Enforcement/ 1051/2012/24 dated 27.01.2013. Impugning the said order and also the order rejecting the application for review, R.N. Spinning Mills Ltd. filed WP No. 4383 of 2013 and obtained a Rule Nisi and order of stay (Annexure-R and R1). Be it mentioned that the said writ petition is not before us for adjudication.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Rules have been contested by the respondent no. 1 Commission by filing separate affidavit-in-opposition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The case of the Commission, in short, is that as per rule 6(2) of the Rights Issue Rules, 2006, the issuer is required to call upon the underwriter(s) to subscribe within 10 (ten) days of “closing of the subscription lists.” The Company’s subscription list opened on 19.02.2012 and closed on 13.03.2012 and thus, the period of calling upon the underwriters to subscribe to the unsubscribed shares was within 23.03.2012, whereas the Company called upon the underwriters on 26.04.2012 <em>i.e.</em> more than 1 (one) month after the prescribed time limit. The issuer, <em>i.e.</em> the writ petitioners’ Company has, therefore, violated the provision of rule 6(2) of the Rights Issue Rules. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the Company failed to provide proof of Bank Asia’s refusal to accept the underwriters’ and sponsor shareholders’ subscription. The letter dated 22.02.2012 from the Company to the Commission has no mention of Bank Asia refusing to accept the sponsor shareholders’ subscription payments. 3 (three) sponsors of the issuer, namely, Mrs. Shirin Faruk, Mr. Kim Jong Suk and M.L. Dying Limited deposited subscription money through Agrani Bank, Shahjalal Islami Bank and a different account of Bank Asia (which was not mentioned in the Rights Share Offer Document (ROD) as banker to the issue) between 03.06.2912 to 07.06.2012, even though the subscription for right shares had closed on 13.03.2012. The Company, therefore, clearly contravened the law and the terms and conditions imposed by the approval letter.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon enquiry, the enquiry committee found the Subscription Status Report along with bank statements submitted by the petitioners’ Company on 22.03.2012 to be forged and false. The forgery was confirmed by the concerned banks and as such, there was absolutely no question of giving the Commission’s consent to the Company to credit the right shares as applied for.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In respect of non-supply of the enquiry reports to the petitioners, it has been stated in the affidavit-in-opposition that it is apparent from the Company’s response dated 04.102012 that nowhere in the said letter the Company mentioned that it could not make any effective reply to the show cause notice for non-supply of the enquiry report, nor did it request the Commission to supply the same to it.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Rokanuddin Mahmud, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for all the writ petitioners, advances the following arguments in support of the Rules:	<ol><li>The most serious allegation, namely the usage of the Company’s funds by sponsor directors and sponsor shareholder, has not actually been admitted or proven, but rather, the facts and circumstances clearly show that these funds were generated from the subscription of the directors and sponsor shareholders themselves and not from the funds of the petitioners.</li><li>The allegations brought against the petitioners, even if admitted, do not warrant the imposition of the penalty that has been given.</li><li>The Commission has not applied its mind individually to the several allegations that have been made and arrived at a conclusion without recording any finding as to whether each of the charges was proven individually, but has rather proceeded in an omnibus fashion.</li><li>The satisfaction of willful refusal, failure or contravention required for penalty to be imposed against a person being not present in the impugned orders, the same is violative of and <em>ultra vires</em> the provisions of section 22 of the Ordinance, 1969.</li><li>The Commission having decided to proceed with respect to the allegations in issue under section 22 of the Ordinance, there is no scope to hold directors of the Company <em>i.e.</em> the petitioners vicariously liable for any alleged willful refusal, failure or contravention of the Company.</li><li>The impugned orders were not preceded by any show cause notice personally addressed to the petitioners and hence, it is violative of section 22 of the Ordinance and the principle of natural justice.</li><li>The Commission disposed of the petitioners’ applications for review unilaterally without even conducting an application hearing which is a blatant breach of the principle of natural justice.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Probir Neogi, the learned senior Counsel appearing for the respondent no. 1 Commission, on the other hand, opposes the Rules by submitting that the Commission has duly followed the procedure prescribed by law. In the process, it conducted detailed and credible enquiry in the matter and served show cause notice upon the petitioners giving full particulars of the allegations brought against them. In the said notice, the enquiry report concerned was adequately quoted giving the petitioners ample opportunity of explaining their case. Furthermore, all the contraventions have been admitted by the petitioners in the reply to the show cause notice signed by the Company Secretary on behalf of the Company and the Directors.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In respect of the argument advanced by Mr. Mahmud that the Directors of the Company cannot be individually penalized for wrongs committed by the Company, Mr. Neogi submits that the argument is not tenable in law for two reasons; firstly, a number of offences related to the penalty have been directly committed by the Directors or Sponsors themselves, and secondly, under the Ordinance, every Director, Manager or other officers responsible of the conduct of a Company is liable for the wrongs committed by such Company.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Neogi finally submits that the Commission has fully complied with the provisions of section 22 of the Ordinance and that there has been no violation of the principle of natural justice.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the learned Advocates of both sides and perused the materials on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The respondent no. 1 the Commission issued one show cause notice dated 23.09.2012 (Annexure-M) which was addressed to the Company R.N. Spinning Mills Ltd. and its Directors. The notice referred to the enquiry report and set out the facts. In the notice, 8(eight) contraventions were mentioned out of which 3(three) contraventions <em>i.e.</em> contravention nos. (d), (f) and (g) were alleged to have been committed by the petitioners. The rest were directed against the Company itself and its Secretary.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The petitioners did not reply to the show cause notice. However, the Company, through its Secretary, gave a written reply dated 04.10.2012 (Annexure-N) to the show cause notice responding to each of the contraventions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Commission, vide separate impugned orders, all dated 27.01.2013 (Annexure-A), imposed penalty upon the petitioners and the Company. The Company is not a petitioner before us.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The impugned orders are in identical terms, except for the operative parts, in which the names of the delinquents upon whom the penalty has been imposed. Analysis and discussion of one impugned order shall cover the cases of all the writ petitioners.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The relevant portions of the impugned orders, so for as they relate to the petitioners, are quoted below for ready reference:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>তারিখঃ ২৭ জানুয়ারী ২০১৩</strong><br/><strong><u>অাদেশ</u></strong><br/><strong>       যেহেতু,</strong> Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 (Ordinance No. XVII of 1969) Hl Section 2(g) <strong>মোতাবেক</strong> R.N.

Spinning Mills Limited <strong>এর লিখিত বক্তব্য থেকে সুস্পষ্ট প্রতীয়মান হয় যে, শুনানীর নোটিশের অভিযোগসমূহ</strong> R.N. Spinning Mills Limited <strong>স্বীকার করেছে, যা ইচ্ছাকৃত এবং সিকিউরিটিজ আইন পরিপালনে ব্যর্থতা বিধায় </strong>Section 22 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 <strong>অনুযায়ী শাসি¹যোগ্য অপরাধ এবং যা ক্ষমার অযোগ্য;</strong><br/><strong><u>আদেশ</u></strong><br/>         <strong>অতএব, সেহেতু, কমিশন, উল্লিখিত যাবতীয় বিষয় বিবেচনাপূর্বক,</strong> Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 (Ordinance No. XVII of 1969) Hl section 22 [যা The Securities and Exchange (Amendment) Act, 2000 <strong>দ্বারা সংশোধিত) এর প্রদত্ত  ক্ষমতাবলে পরিচালক জনাব কিম জং সুক এর উপর ৫০ (পঞ্চাশ) লক্ষ টাকা জরিমানা ধার্য্য করল যা অত্র আদেশের তারিখ হতে ১৫ (পনের) দিনের মধ্যে "বাংলাদেশ সিকিউরিটিজ অ্যান্ড এক্সচেঞ্জ কমিশন' এর অনুকূলে উস্যুকৃত ব্যাংক ড্রাফট/পে-অর্ডারের মাধ্যমে কমিশনে জমা করতে হবেz </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the impugned order that in the process of reaching the conclusion in respect of finding the petitioners liable for the alleged contraventions, the Commission refrained from giving its own finding against each of them, rather solely relied upon the written reply of the Company. The Commission concluded that the Company admitted the charges mentioned in the notice which is wilful and hence, the directors are liable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The petitioners did not reply to the show cause notice. Nevertheless, they may be found liable for the alleged contraventions, but, in that case, the Commission must give specific finding to that effect. Simply a sole reliance on the reply of the Company in making them liable contravenes the fundamental principle of the Company Law that the Company, being a juristic person, is distinct from its members or shareholders. The Commission seems to have ignored this principle. The Commission must lift the corporate veil and record reasons for so doing prior to making the Directors liable on the basis of admission of the Company. Admission of ‘A’ in respect of ‘B’ cannot be the sole basis to make ‘B’ liable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Commission passed the impugned order by virtue of the power conferred upon it under section 22 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969. The relevant parts of section 22 run thus:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“22. Penalty for certain refusal or failure.-</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">If any person-	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li>refuses or fails to furnish any document, paper or information which he is required to furnish by or under this Ordinance; or</li><li>refuses or fails to comply with any order or direction of the Commission made or issued under this Ordinance; or</li><li>contravenes or otherwise fails to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance;</li></ol></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">the Commission may, if it is <u>satisfied</u> after giving the person an opportunity of being heard that the refusal, failure or contravention was <u>wilful</u>, by order direct that such person shall pay to the Commission by way of penalty such sum not less than one lakh taka as may be specified in the order and, in the case of a continuing default, a sum calculated at the rate of ten thousand further Taka for every day after the issue of such order during which the refusal, failure or contravention continues. <em>(emphasis supplied)</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">...</li><li style="text-align: justify;">...”</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">By using the words ‘satisfied’ and ‘wilful’ in section 22(1)(c), the legislature has clearly intended that the Commission must be ‘satisfied that the contravention is wilful’. Any contravention, which is not wilful, or appears not to be wilful, in our view, would not attract section 22. It implies the requirement of giving reasons by the Commission as to contravention which is wilful.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">When the Commission passes an order under section 22, it acts as a quasi-judicial authority. Mahmudul Islam in ‘Constitutional Law of Bangladesh’ (3<sup>rd</sup> ed., pp. 694 para 5.64 J) referred to a number of cases and observed,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Requirement of giving reasons:</em> General principle of law is that in the absence of statutory requirement, an administrative order need not be a reasoned one except where there is a provision for an administrative appeal. However, fairness and transparency of administrative decisions require reasons to be recorded. The requirement of recording reasons by every quasi-judicial or even an administrative authority entrusted with the task of passing an order adversely against an individual and communication thereof to the affected persons is one of the recognised facets of the rules of natural justice and violation thereof has the effect of vitiating the order passed by the authority concerned. ...The requirement of reasoned decision not only ensures application of mind of the authority, eschews arbitrariness and improves the quality of administrative adjudication, but also ensures fairness and transparency and enables the review court to properly examine the impugned decision.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>R.V. Higher Education Funding Council ex p. Institute of Dental Surgery</em></strong> [1994] 1 AC 531, it was held that the giving of reasons may among other things concentrate the decision-maker’s mind on the right questions; demonstrate to the recipient that this is so; show the issues have been conscientiously addressed and how the result has been reached; or alternatively alert the recipient to a justiciable flaw in the process.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>Siemens Engineering &amp; Manufacturing</em></strong><strong><em> Company of India Ltd. v. Union of India and others,</em></strong> AIR 1976 SC 1785: (1976) 2 SCC 981, the Indian Supreme Court while considering the exercise of statutory duties held that giving of reasons is like the principle of <em>audi alteram partem,</em> a basis principle of natural justice which must inform every <em>quasi-</em>judicial process and this rule must be observed in its proper spirit and mere pretence of compliance with it would not satisfy the requirement of law. It was held that where an authority makes an order in exercise of a <em>quasi</em>-judicial function, it must record its reasons in support of an order it makes. Every <em>quasi-</em>judicial order must be supported by reasons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>R. (on the application of Jones) v. North Warwickshire Borough Council,</em></strong> (2001) EWCA Civ 315, it was held by Laws LJ that “the general law as regards the duty of a public decision-maker to take relevant considerations into account is well-known. (1) If the operative statute provides a lexicon of relevant considerations to which attention is to be paid, then obviously the decision-maker must follow the lexicon. (2) If however the statute provides no such lexicon, or at least no exhaustive lexicon, then the decision-maker must decide for himself what he will take into account. In doing so he must obviously be guided by the policy and objects of the governing statute, but his decision as to what he will consider and what he will not consider is itself only to be reviewed on the conventional Wednesbury principle.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>R. v. Oadby and Wigston Borough Council, ex p Dickman, </em></strong>(1996) 28 HLR 806, it was held by Buxton J that “Looking at the wording chosen in the Regulations against the background of administrative law principles I have no doubt that the draftsman, and through him the legislator, is telling us that the only factors that are relevant, and, therefore, the only factors that the authority should take into consideration, are those which are specially set out. Otherwise, the implication is that the authority is bound to take into account a factor which has been said to be not irrelevant, or at least not to be relevant. That is a conclusion that I do not think is likely or even lawfully.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have already noted that the requirements of section 22 of the Ordinance are two-folds; firstly, the Commission has to be satisfied that there has been a contravention, and secondly, the same was wilful.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Company, in the reply to the show cause notice, while admitting some of the allegations, gave clarifications of the events and stated that they occurred due to some ‘unavoidable circumstances’. The Company never admitted that the alleged contraventions were wilful. The Commission concluded that the contraventions are wilful, but refrained from giving any reason in support of its finding. This is simply perverse and violates the requirements of section 22.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Neogi, the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no. 1 Commission, refers to the case of <strong><em>Cauvery Software Engineering Systems Ltd., In re</em></strong> (2004) 11 Comp LJ 230 (SEBI) and submits that in the instant case, the petitioners, who are natural persons, acted as directors of the Company and are responsible for the commissions and omissions of the Company. In the cited case, relied upon by Mr. Neogi, it was held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“I find that the directors of the company are responsible for the commissions and omissions of the company as they are the persons who are conducting the affairs of the company. A corporate entity acts through its directors who are natural persons. It is therefore, necessary to lift the corporate veil and find that the natural persons who acts as directors of the company are guilty of the commissions and omissions of the company. The concept of corporate entity was evolved to encourage and evolve trade and commerce but not to commit illegalities and, therefore, I am convinced that this is a fit case to pass an order against the directors of Cauvery also.<br/>The conduct of Cauvery and its directors is detrimental to the interest of the investors and the safety and orderly development of the securities market. Unless these are checked, it would pose serious challenge to the regulatory authority. It is to be noted that persons who operate in the market are required to maintain high standards of integrity, promptitude and fairness in the conduct of the business dealings. A listed Company which indulges in misconduct such as narrated above and shakes the confidence of the investors is not fit and proper to operate in the securities market.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The decision in the cited case was given by a whole time Member of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) which has been established under section 3 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (in short ‘SEBI Act’). The order was passed in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Member under section 19 of SEBI Act read with sections 11, 11(4)(b) and 11B of the Act. Section 19 of SEBI Act, 1992 states,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“19. The Board may, by general or special order in writing delegate to any member, officer of the Board or any other person subject to such conditions, if any, as may be specified in the order, such of its powers and functions under this Act (except the powers under section 29) as it may deem necessary.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Section 11 of SEBI Act deals with functions of the Board. Section 11(4)(b) runs thus:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“11(4) Without prejudice to the provisions contained in sub-sections (1), (2), (2A) and (3) and section 11B, the Board may, by an order, for reasons to be recorded in writing, in the interests of investors or securities market, take any of the following measures, either pending investigation or inquiry or on completion of such investigation or inquiry, namely:-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">... </li><li style="text-align: justify;">restrain persons from accessing the securities market and prohibit any person associated with securities market to buy, sell or deal in securities;” </li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The relevant parts of section 11B of SEBI Act as it stood at the relevant time, are as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“11B. Save as otherwise provided in section 11, if after making or causing to be made an enquiry, the Board is satisfied that it is necessary,- ...”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In <em>Cauvery</em> case, reasons have been assigned for lifting the veil of incorporation. Moreover, the order was passed following a scrutiny and analysis of the show cause notice, the reply and relevant documents, which are absent in the instant case. Here, the Commission did not attempt to lift the corporate veil. Facts and circumstances also do not warrant the same in judicial review.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Neogi refers to Annexure-2 series, which are Subscription  Status Reports filed by the Company and the respective Banks to the Commission and ancillary related documents, and submits that the enquiry committee found that the Subscription Status Report along with Bank statements submitted by the Company on 22.03.2012 are forged and false.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The enquiry report was not supplied along with the show cause notice. Neither in the show cause notice nor in the impugned order fraud was alleged. Absence of a speaking order cannot be cured by an affidavit giving reasons which should have been in the order itself (<strong><em>Union of India v. H.P. Chothia</em></strong>, (1978) 2 SCC 586). Therefore, we do not find any substance and relevancy in the argument.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">So far as the rejection of review applications is concerned, the same is a non-speaking one. The rejection order dated 07.04.2013 (Annexure-A1) states,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The Commission has considered your request dated February 13, 2013 as a review petition under section 26 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 and has decided to uphold its earlier decision of penalty imposed vide the above stated Order.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The order of imposition of penalty as well as the order rejecting the review application suffer from non-application of mind and are violative of the provisions of section 22 of the Ordinance. They have also failed to meet the requirement of duty to give reasons, which a quasi-judicial body is entrusted with the task of passing an order adversely against an individual.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Our observations on the matter are concluded thus; the decisions of the Commission imposing penalty upon the petitioners are perverse and without any lawful authority, firstly, because, those are solely based on reply of the Company, although the Commission treated the same as admission without lifting the corporate veil, and secondly, the Commission did not assign reasons of its own in holding that the contraventions are wilful and thus, violated the requirements of section 22 of the Ordinance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The inevitable conclusion that follows from the above discussions is that the Rules must succeed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rules are made absolute. The impugned orders, all dated 27.01.2013 (Annexure-A to the writ petitions), imposing a penalty of Tk. 50,00,000/- upon the petitioners of WP Nos. 5300 of 2013 (Md. Abdul Kader Faruk) and 5754 of 2013 (Kim Jong Suk), and Tk. 25,00,000/- upon the petitioner of WP No. 5301 of 2013 (Shirin Faruk) and also orders, all dated 07.04.2013 (Annexure-A1 to the writ petitions) rejecting the review applications passed by the respondent no. 1 are declared to have been issued without lawful authority and are of no legal effect and are hereby set aside.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">    There is no order as to cost.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

No. 356(2)95, under sections 409, 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 109 of the Penal Code together with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II of 47) now pending in the Court of Special Divisional Judge, Mymensingh.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">At the time of issuance of the Rule on 23.03.2004, all further proceeding of the aforesaid case was stayed for a period of four months. Subsequently, by order dated 19.07.2004, the order of stay was extended till disposal of the Rule. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Chowdhury Ishraq Ahmed Siddiky, the learned Advocate appears on behalf of the petitioner in support of the Rule, while Mr. Md. Fazlur Rahman Khan, the learned Deputy Attorney General (briefly, the DAG) appears in opposition to the Rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Relevant facts necessary for disposal of the Rule are that on 20.12.1994, an FIR was lodged by the Executive Engineer, Sales and Supply Division 1, Mymensingh stating, inter alia, that the Resident Engineer, Purbadhala Electric Sales and Supply Section, Power Development Board (briefly, PDB) sent a letter dated 20.11.1994 to him (i.e., the informant) asking for some electric goods and machineries, which was forwarded to the concerned authority for taking necessary action. The said goods and machineries were sent to the informant, who, in turn, handed them over to the accused petitioner through the lineman of his office on 21.09.1995.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, when the Resident Engineer of Pubadhala Electric Supply, PDB went to the office of the informant in connection with some official work, the informant asked him about the goods and machineries, who replied that the goods and machineries were kept at the petitioner’s house as it was not possible to take them to the assigned godown at that time. The informant directed the accused petitioner to deposit the goods and machineries in the Divisional Godown.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The informant sent a letter to the accused petitioner seeking information about the goods and machineries. In reply, the Resident Engineer replied that he had no knowledge about it. Subsequently, one Azizur Rahman was called to the office of the informant, who admitted that the goods and machineries were in his custody. Thereafter, Azizur Rahman and Nazrul Islam went to the informant’s office and admitted their guilt and wanted to return the goods and machineries. However, as they failed to do so, the informant lodged the case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The police took up investigation and, upon conclusion of the same, submitted charge sheet against three accused persons including the petitioner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The case was then sent for trial to the Court of Special Divisional Judge, Mymensingh and charge was framed against the accused petitioner and two others on 19.05.2002. However, after the framing of charge, the Public Prosecutor obtained adjournment on several dates as none of the witnesses appeared to depose in the case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, a Departmental proceeding was initiated by PDB by constituting a four member Enquiry Committee, headed by the Superintendent Engineer.  Although the petitioner and two others were charged under 6 (six) separate heads, the Committee found that 5 of the charges could not be established against the petitioner. However, with respect to the other charge, the Committee only “suspected” the petitioner’s involvement with the same.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Despite the findings as aforesaid, PDB issued Memo No. 184-¢hE­h¡- (Ax nª)3/H-21/95 dated 16.06.1999 imposing a penalty of Tk. 53,149.70, directing the petitioner to pay the same through monthly installment of Tk. 1,000/- each. The petitioner’s increment was also stopped for 1(one) year.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Challenging the same, the petitioner filed Writ Petition No. 2703 of 1999, which was contested by PDB by filing an affidavit-in-opposition. Upon hearing both sides, a Division Bench of this Court, by judgment and order dated 26.07.2006, made the Rule absolute, declaring the aforesaid Memo dated 16.09.1999 to have been issued without lawful authority.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, subsequent to filing of the Writ Petition, but prior to pronouncement of judgment, the concerned authority filed the criminal case against the petitioner on 30.08.2000 in respect of the self same allegation and charge.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved thereby, the petitioner moved this Court and obtained the instant Rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Chowdhury Israk Ahmed Siddiky, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that the Enquiry Committee, constituted by the Power Development Board, conducted a thorough investigation into the matter, but failed to establish the charges against the petitioner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Referring to the judgment dated 26.07.2006 passed in Writ Petition No. 2703 of 1999, Dr. Siddiky submits that since a competent Court of law declared the imposition of penalty and stoppage of increment of the petitioner by PDB to be illegal and without lawful authority, the entire matter came to an end there. Dr. Siddiky further submits that since the petitioner had been exonerated from all the charges by a competent Court of law, he cannot now be put on trial in respect of the same set of charges in a criminal forum, being barred under Article 111 of the Constitution. Furthermore, according to Dr. Siddiky, a criminal Court is not competent to deal with any matter that has already been dealt with by a civil Court in another proceeding. Therefore, the proceeding of the said criminal case filed against the petitioner case is liable to be quashed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Md. Fazlur Rahman Khan, the learned Deputy General appearing for the State submits that the Departmental Enquiry Committee found the petitioner guilty. Mr. Khan contends that although the imposition of penalty and stoppage of one year’s increment was set aside by this Court in Writ Petition No. 2703 of 1999, the Board filed a criminal case against the petitioner, which is still pending in the Court below. According to Mr. Khan, since a prima-facie case appears to have been disclosed against the petitioner, the question of quashment of the proceeding does not arise at this stage and therefore, the Rule is liable to be discharged.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have perused the instant application together with the connected documents, more particularly, the judgment dated 26.07.2006 passed in Writ Petition No. 2703 of 1999. We have also considered the submission advanced by the learned Advocates of the contending sides.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, the petitioner was initially charged under six heads by PDB. The Enquiry Committee, after a thorough investigation, found that five heads of charge could not be established against the petitioner. However, the Committee “suspected” that the petitioner had “complicity” with one charge. Accordingly, vide Memo dated 16.06.1999, he was penalized by imposition of fine and stoppage of one year’s increment, which was, however, challenged through Writ Petition No. 2703 of 1999, wherein the Rule was made absolute on contest by judgment dated 26.07.2003.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Let us now refer to the report of the Enquiry Committee, wherein the finding of the Committee reads as under :</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong><u>অভি­যাগ নং ১ঃ</u></strong><br/><strong>ক) অভি­যা­গর সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরনঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>খ) অভিযু­ও্রর সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>গ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির বও্রব্যঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>ঘ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির সিদ্ধা¿¹ঃ অভি­যাগ স­ন্দহাতীতভা­ব প্রতিষ্ঠিত নয়z </strong><strong>”</strong><br/><strong><u>অভি­যাগ নং ২ (অনু­চ্ছদ-২)ঃ</u></strong><br/><strong>ক) অভি­যা­গর সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরনঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>খ) অভিযু­ও্রর সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>গ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির বও্রব্যঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>ঘ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির সিদ্ধা¿¹ঃ অভি­যাগ প্রতিষ্ঠিত নয়z</strong><br/><strong><u>অভি­যাগ নং ৩ (অনু­চ্ছদ-৩)ঃ</u></strong><br/><strong>ক) অভি­যা­গর সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরনঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>খ) অভিযু­ও্রর সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>গ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির বও্রব্যঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>ঘ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির সিদ্ধা¿¹ঃ অভি­যাগ সরাসরি প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয় নাইz ত­ব মিটার কারচুপি­ত সংশ্লিষ্টতা রহিয়া­ছ বলিয়া ম­ন হয়z</strong><br/><strong><u>অভি­যাগ নং ৪ (অনু­চ্ছদ- ৪)ঃ</u></strong><br/><strong>ক) অভি­যা­গর সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরনঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>খ) অভিযু­ও্রর সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>গ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির বও্রব্যঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>ঘ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির সিদ্ধা¿¹ঃ অভি­যাগ প্রতিষ্ঠিত নয়z</strong><br/><strong><u>অভি­যাগ নং ৫ (অনু­চ্ছদ-৫)ঃ</u></strong><br/><strong>ক) অভি­যা­গর সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরনঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>খ) অভিযু­ও্রর সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>গ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির বও্রব্যঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>ঘ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির সিদ্ধা¿¹ঃ অভি­যাগ প্রতিষ্ঠিত নয়z</strong><br/><strong><u>অভি­যাগ নং ৬ (অনু­চ্ছদ- ৬)ঃ</u></strong><br/><strong>ক) অভি­যা­গর সংক্ষিপ্ত বিবরনঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>খ) অভিযু­ও্রর সংক্ষিপ্ত জবাবঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>গ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির মতামতঃ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong><br/><strong>ঘ) কমিটির সিদ্ধা¿¹ঃ অভি­যাগ প্রতিষ্ঠিত নয়z</strong><strong>”</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, out of the six charges brought against the petitioner, the Committee found that five charges could not be established, let alone be proved, against the petitioner. With regard to the remaining one charge, the Committee found as under :</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>ঘ) তদ¿¹ কমিটির সিদ্ধা¿¹ঃ অভি­যাগ সরাসরি প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয় নাইz ত­ব মিটার কারচুপি­ত সংশ্লিষ্টতা রহিয়া­ছ বলিয়া ম­ন হয়z</strong><strong>”</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, when the Enquiry Committee failed to establish the charges against the petitioner, initiation of a criminal proceeding, and that too on the same set of charges, would tantamount to an abuse of the process of the Court, more particularly when the standard of proof required in a criminal case is much higher than those required in a departmental proceeding.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Let us now refer to some decisions which has been cited by Dr. Siddiky.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Srikisson Beriwala and another v. Emperor, reported in 37 Cr. L J 187, the Court held :</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Where the issues in a criminal case are likely to be included in the issues in Civil Court which is ripe for hearing and there is a risk of a conflict of jurisdiction, it is better that the criminal proceeding are stayed.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Muhammad Akbar v. The State and another, reported in PLD 1968 Supreme Court 281, the Supreme Court of Pakistan held :</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“There is now consensus of opinion that there is no invariable rule that a criminal proceeding should be stayed pending the decision of the Civil suit but the matter is one of discretion entirely. In exercising this discretion the guiding principle should be to see to whether the accused is likely to be prejudiced if the criminal proceeding is not stayed.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In our own jurisdiction, in the case of Abdul Quader vs. State, reported in 28 DLR (AD) 1978, 38, the Court held :</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“In the criminal proceeding in question is in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by an accused person and it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or continuance of the said proceedings the High Court would be justified in quashing the proceedings on that ground.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Mr. Khan has referred to a decision reported in 5 BLT (AD) 1997, 22 (M. Rahela Khatun vs. M.A. Hassan and others), where the Apex Court held that a criminal proceeding could not be quashed on the basis of defence materials which were still not part of the materials for the prosecution. However, the case is quite distinguishable from the one before us.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this contest, I may profitably refer to the case of P.S. Rajya v. State of Bihar, reported in (1996) 9 Supreme Court Cases 1, where the facts were very similar to the present case before us.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In that case, the moot question was whether the respondent was justified in pursuing the prosecution against the appellant, who had been exonerated in the departmental proceeding, under section 5(2) read with section 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption  Act, 1947. As the charges in the criminal proceeding was the same as in the departmental proceeding, the Supreme Court of India answered in the negative and allowed the appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, the petitioner stands on a much better footing. The initial Departmental enquiry conducted by a 4 (four) member Committee, found that five out of six charges could not be established against the petitioner. However, as the Committee “suspected” the petitioner’s complicity with one head of charge, a fine of Taka 53,000/= and odd was imposed and his increment for 1 year was stopped, which was challenged through Writ Petition No. 2703 of 1999. Upon hearing the parties and more particularly, having considered the Enquiry Report, the Court held that since the charges could not be proved against the petitioner, the imposition of fine and stoppage of 1(one) year’s increment by PDB was illegal and accordingly, made the Rule absolute by judgment dated 26.07.2003.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is, therefore, evident that the case against the petitioner was considered twice – once by the Departmental Enquiry Committee and subsequently, by this Court. On both occasions, he stood exonerated. Therefore, in our view, the continuation of the impugned proceeding against the petitioner in Special Case No. 11 of 2001, pending before the Court of Divisional Special Judge, Mymensingh, would certainly tantamount to an abuse of the process of the Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Be that as it may, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in due deference to the decisions referred to above, we are inclined to hold that the instant Rule merits positive consideration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is made absolute.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The proceedings of Special Case No. 11 of 2001 arising out of Kotwali Police Station Case No. 12(7)95, corresponding to G.R. No. 356(2)95 under sections 409, 419, 420, 467, 468, 471,109 of the Penal Code and section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (Act II/47) now pending in the Court of Special Divisional Judge, Mymensingh, so far as it relates to the petitioner, is hereby quashed.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         The office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/>         <strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

For the Opposite Parties </em></strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div> <div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Borhanuddin, J:</u></strong><br/>         This rule has been issued calling upon the opposite party no.1 to show cause as to why the judgment and order dated 11.05.2011 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Chittagong, in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 276 of 2002 allowing the appeal by setting aside order dated 30.09.2002 passed by the Waqf Administrator, Dhaka, in Miscellaneous Enrolment Case No. 01 of 2000 corresponding to E. C. No.16832, should not be set aside and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this court may seem fit and proper.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts relevant for disposal of the rule are that Miscellaneous E.C. no.01 of 2000 arose out of application dated 12.12.1999 and 14.05.2000 respectively filed by the petitioner M. Tofazzel Ahmed for enrolment of certain properties under Section 47 of the Waqf Ordinance which cause dispute with the properties enrolled earlier under E.C. no.16832. M. Tafazzel Ahmed, petitioner herein, filed an application on 12.12.1999 for enrolment of .19 acres of land as Waqf under Section 47 of the Waqf Ordinance; Concern Waqf Inspector was directed to inspect and submit report in Miscellaneous E.C. no.01 of 2000; Accordingly, Waqf Inspector submitted his report on 25.01.2000 stating that Mosharaf Ali and others dedicated .19 acres of land in favour of Eshatul Ulum madrasha and mosque by a registered deed of gift; As per condition of the Waqf deed, secretary of the madrasha managing committee has been supervising the same; But .12 acres of land appertaining to R.S. Plot no.12163 under the said deed of gift earlier enrolled in E. C. no. 16832 by one Jasim Uddin Haider Faruqui showing the land belongs to a mosque established by one Asharaf Ali Sareng; Pursuant to the report of the waqf inspector dated 25.01.2000, a notice under Section 47(5) of the Waqf Ordinance was served upon the Secretary of E. C. no.16832 Jasimuddin Faruqui to explain his position; Petitioner Tafazzal Ahmed filed another application on 14.05.20000 under section 47 of the Waqf Ordinance claiming that one Abu Bakar Siddique enrolled 0.36 acres of land including 0.12 acres of land appertaining to R.S. Plot no.12163 in E. C. no.16832 and got approval of a committee in violation of Waqf deed; On query, it reveals that a waqf deed relating to 0.24 acres of land appertaining to Plot no.13554 created in favour of the Rupchand Shah Fakir mosque committee vide registered deed dated 26.05.1990 and Wakifa Alfa Khatun gifted decimals of land in favour of the mosque; As such, petitioner Tafazzal Ahmed prays to cancel record of E.C. no.16832 and enroll 0.24 acres of land in the record of Misc. E.C. no.1 of 2000; Copy of the application sent to the Mutawalli/ Secretary of E. C. no. 16832 who filed a written reply stating that prayer of Tafazzal Hossain has no legal basis; Then the matter was taken up for hearing. In the hearing, petitioner submits that he has been served as principal of the Kagatia Eshatul ulum madrasha from 1957-1997 and also as Secretary of the Madrasha Managing Committee; Though he retired from the post of the Principal on 13.06.1997 but performing as Secretary of the Madrasha Managing Committee;  The opposite parties i.e. Moulana Abu Bakar Siddiquie and Md. Jasim Uddin Faruqui identifying themselves as President and Secretary filed application under section 47 of the Waqf Ordinance to enroll .36 acres of land on 26.07.1989 beyond knowledge of the madrasa committee; In column 6 of the application “Mosque” is written as name of the Wakif and in column 9 in place of date and year it is written “Mo. Binajury, Upazilla Raozan, Chittagong” and in 3<sup>rd</sup> page of the application “Hazrat Rupchand (Rah:) Fakir Masjid Committee” is written in place of the name of mutwalli; On the basis of such incomplete and wrong application, E. C. no.16832 has been enrolled as public waqf and a committee consisting of 15 members also approved on 25.11.1991 which was not disclosed for a long period; When the concern waqf inspector went to the area for inspection of another waqf estate then it is disclosed amongst public and thereafter the petitioner filed application for enrolment and cancellation of the earlier enrolment; In total .43 acres of land including .36 acres enrolled in E. C. no.16832 are waqf property of mosque and Madrasha; As such, the petitioner prays to enroll .43 acres of land in the record of Miscellaneous E. C. no.1 of 2000 by cancelling E. C. no.16832.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the opposite party submits that application filed by M. Tafazzal Ahmed is contrary to the law and the statements made in the application are false and baseless as such, application is liable to be rejected.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After hearing the parties and perusing the relevant papers/documents, Administrator of Waqf passed an order on 30.09.2002 keeping the original E. C. record 16832 as it was appointing petitioner M. Tofazzal Ahmed as Mutwalli/Secretary of the Waqf estate, approving a 15 member committee of the estate as proposed by the petitioner for a period of 5 years and enroll the properties submitted by the petitioner in E. C. no.16832 renaming the Waqf estate as “Kagotia Eshatul Ulum Madrasha waqf estate” cancelling previous name “Hazrat Rupchand Shah (R) Fakir masjid Waqf estate”. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved, the opposite party as appellant filed Miscellaneous Appeal No.276 of 2002 in the Court of learned District Judge, Chittagong, which was ultimately heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Chittagong, who after hearing the parties and assessing the evidence on record allowed the appeal on 11.05.2011 by setting aside the order passed by the Administrator of Waqf holding that Rupchand Shah Mosque and Committee exists long before filing of miscellaneous E.C. no.1 of 2000 and the P. S. and B.S khatian recorded in the name of president of Rupchand Shah Mosque Committee who mutated the khatians on payment of rents and taxes to the Government exchequer.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and order, the petitioner preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule with an order of stay.  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Abdul Quaiyum, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner at the very outset submits that Miscellaneous Appeal filed by the opposite party as appellant against the order of administrator of Waqf is not maintainable under the waqf ordinance inasmuch as the administrator of Wakf passed the order under Section 47 of the Wakf Ordinance against which remedy lies only under Article 102 of the constitution and not considering this legal aspect appellate court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. He also submits that appeal under Section 35 of the Wakf Ordinance available to the Mutwali or any person claiming any interest in the property in respect of which a notification has been issued under Sub-section (1) of Section 34 of the Ordinance and as such the appellate court below committed an illegality in passing the impugned judgment and order. He further submits that court below committed an error of law in not considering that appeal against order under Section 47 is not provided in the Waqf Ordinance and unless a right of appeal is clearly and expressly given by the statute, it does not exist, nor is there any scope for interfering such a right by implication. In this regard Mr. Mahbubey Alam supports contention of Mr. Quaiyum. Mr. Alam submits that since no provision of second appeal exists, the petitioner legally and correctly exhausts the forum of revisional jurisdiction. In support of his submissions, learned Advocate Mr. Abdul Quaiyum referred to the case of Hari Miah vs. the state, reported in 10 DLR 123; the case of Syed Masud Ali and others vs. Md. Asmatullah and others, reported in 31 DLR 249 and the case of Bangladesh vs. Abdul Mannan and others, reported in 29 DLR(SC) 17.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand Mr. Abdul Momen Chowdhury, learned advocate appearing for the opposite party no.1 submits that the administrator of wakf passed the order after hearing the parties and perusing the evidence on record submitted by the parties as such it is not only an order relating to application for enrolment rather it is an order resolving a dispute between the parties after hearing and perusing relevant documents adduced by the parties which comes within the ambit of Section 50 of the Wakf Ordinance and as such appeal under Section 35 of the Wakf Ordinance was the appropriate forum against the order passed by administrator of wakf. He also submits that since section 35 provides an appeal against the order of the learned District Judge, instant revisional application is not maintainable and liable to be rejected. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Syed Masud Ali and others vs. Md. Asmatullah and others, reported in 31 DLR (AD) 1979.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dispute is to be resolved whether miscellaneous appeal filed by the opposite party against order of the Administrator of Waqf under Section 47 of the Waqf Ordinance was a competent one, if the answer is affirmative, whether this revisional application against judgment and order of the District Judge is maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On perusal of the provisions of Section 47 of the Waqf Ordinance it appears that this section imposes a duty on the administrator to enroll all waqfs and maintain register. In the register the particulars to be recorded are enumerated. This duty under the Section is administrative in nature. When a waqf is enrolled and particulars are recorded in the register, description of the properties of the waqf are also to be recorded in the register. This register reflects the contents of the instruments of waqf if there be any. It is not an adjudication order. Once a property is entered into the register as waqf property, any person claiming any right over such property is not barred from raising the claim. But Section 50 of the Waqf Ordinance provides that the claimant has to submit his claim to the administrator. When a claim of this nature is submitted to the administrator, role of the administrator stands changed. He becomes an adjudicator and decides the claim which may be allowed or rejected. Contemplation of section 50 is that, the claim so lodged is a dispute. The administrator decides the dispute after hearing the parties. This role of the Administrator is quasi-judicial in nature. Quasi-Judicial decision under Section 50 on a dispute attracts the procedure of Section 35.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this case, from the order passed by the Administrator of Waqf it appears that by filing applications on 12.12.1999 and 14.05.2000, the petitioner raises dispute regarding the previous enrolment of the property in E.C. no.16832 enrolled in the year 1991 as such it is not simply an application under section 47 for enrolment but the petitioner claims his right over the property under Section 50 of the Waqf Ordinance as such it can be said that the claim so lodged is a dispute. The Administrator decides the dispute after hearing the parties. In the instant case this role of the Administrator is quasi- judicial in nature. This quasi-judicial function ends up with a verdict and it can be taken to the court of District Judge under Section 35 for a full fledged judicial adjudication. Decision of the District Judge is appealable. The appeal lies to the High Court Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Section 50 of the Waqf Ordinance is as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“<strong><u>50. Decision if a property is waqf property</u></strong>- Any question whether a particular property is waqf property or not shall be decided by the Administrator:</em><br/><em>            Provided that the mutawalli or any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Administrator this behalf may, within three months from the date of such decision or order, submit a petition to the District Judge in accordance with the provision of sub-section (1) of section 35; and if such a petition is filed, the provisions of Section 35 shall apply.”</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Syed Masud Ali and others-Vs- Md. Asmatullah and others, reported in 31 DLR(AD) 249, our apex court held that inclusion of a property as waqf property in the register under section 47 is not a decision under section 50 denotes a person who has raised an objection as to the waqf character of any property to the administrator. And the expression “any person aggrieved” denotes the person, who is interested to challenge the order passed by the Administrator on a dispute as to the waqf character of the property.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Again, Section 35(3) of the Waqf Ordinance runs as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“35. Petition and appeal against notification or order by Administrator: </em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>……………………………...</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>……………………………...</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Any person aggrieved by the decision of the District Judge under sub-section (2) may, within sixty days of the order, appeal to the High Court Division.”</em></li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">As it appears from above that Section 35 (3) provides appeal to the High Court Division within 60 days against the decision of the District Judge under Sub-section (2), as such I am of the view that the instant civil revision is not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It may be mentioned here that the learned advocate for the petitioner filed an application for seeking a decision whether this revisional application is to be converted into an appeal. This court is for adjudication of the matter under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure but not for giving advice to the parties whether revisional application will be converted into appeal or not. Furthermore, learned advocate for the petitioner Mr. Abdul Quaiyum though filed the application but maintained his stand that revisional jurisdiction is appropriate forum inasmuch as the appeal filed by the opposite party against the order of the waqf administrator is not in accordance with law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Since I am of the opinion that civil revision does not lie against the order of the learned District Judge inasmuch as section 35(3) provides appeal to the High Court Division against the order of the learned District Judge, I am not inclined to enter into the merit of the case. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the rule is discharged without any order as to cost.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Order of stay granted earlier by this court at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">        Send down lower court records alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> <br/> </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Civil Revision No. 2174 of 2011</strong></a></div></div></div></div>

(1)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27</strong><br/><strong>Naraji petition filed by the informant/ complainant or any other person aggrieved against any report within the meaning of section 27 of the Ain,   submitted by police, Magistrate or any person authorized by the Government or appointed by the Tribunal is maintainable and the Tribunal is competent to take notice of the naraji-petition for its own satisfaction about the acceptability of the investigation or inquiry-report and as an aid to the process taking cognizance.                                       . . . (48)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27</strong><br/><strong>Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898)</strong><br/><strong>Section 200</strong><br/><strong>The informant/complainant or person aggrieved</strong><strong> filing naraji petition against investigation/ inquiry report within the meaning of section </strong><strong>27 of the Ain is  not required to be  examined</strong><strong> u/s 200 of the Code for any purpose.   . . .(48)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain (VIII of 2000)</strong><br/><strong>Section 27</strong><br/><strong>On receipt of the complaint the Tribunal may, if thinks fit, withhold direction for inquiry as contemplated under sub-clause (Ka) of section 27(1Ka) and send the complaint-petition back to the police station for recording a regular case, with direction to cause the investigation to be made by any competent police officer, other than the one who refused to accept the complaint, or direct any other investigating agency to investigate.            . . .

(48)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Words and Phrases</strong><br/><strong>Naraji</strong><br/><strong>If I am not far wrong, naraji is largely a sub-continental phenomenon which owes its </strong><strong>origin to the ever declining public confidence</strong><strong> in police investigation and  found favour with the courts as a document specially focused </strong><strong>on the flaws in investigation indicating possible</strong><strong> ways to set things right.   . . .(12)</strong><br/><strong>Investigation</strong><br/><strong>“Investigation” is a goal- oriented mission, like a tiger chasing a deer, not to stop short of the target and must be allowed exactly as much time as it needs in its bid to reach the target. Statutory limitation giving deadline for the report is, therefore, bound to produce abortive and distorted result to the </strong><strong>advantage of the true offenders. Investigation</strong><strong> being a process that follows its own rules must be allowed to go unhindered unless its goal is reached. What is important is not to squeeze a report within a deadline but constant vigilance by the supervisory authority to see whether the investigation is going in right order and in right pace and take drastic measures against the  investigating officer should any  laches, negligence or foul-play on his part  is noticed.     . . . (43)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Interpretation of statute:</strong><br/><strong>One of the basic principles of common law is, law should serve the public interest. By the </strong><strong>same strain, Parliament, as a body representing</strong><strong> the people, is presumed not to intend absurd or illogical result from the applications of its enactments. Consequently, interpretation of statute finally turns on discovery of the intention of legislature...Strict literalism, one of the principles of statutory interpretation deeply rooted into the parliamentary supremacy in England, is difficult to be fitted into our constitutional dispensation, even though the language of law is clear beyond doubt but produces absurd and illogical result. Here in our jurisdiction Constitution is supreme and every piece of legislation made by parliament must follow the parameters of </strong><strong>the American due process principles enshrined</strong><strong> in Art. 31, in order to qualify as law as well as being enforceable by the Supreme Court. Law, therefore cannot travel far beyond its context and afford to be arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable yielding absurd and illogical consequences. When purpose of the enactment is clear strained construction may legitimately be put to any expression or phrase used inadvertently.</strong><strong> Since the enactments in question apparently go narrower than the purpose of the law we have no hesitation to reject the contentions built upon strict literalism in interpretation totally isolated from the context. The language of clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) must, therefore, be harmonized with the rest of the statute and be construed to include power not only co-equal with powers provided by section 27(1) but also the Tribunal must be taken to include powers to take notice of naraji as well as all other powers incidental to carrying out the purpose of the Ain.           . . .

Moazzam Husain, J:</u></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">This Rule, at the instance of one of the accused,  was issued calling in question the legality  of the proceedings in Petition  (Nari-o-Shishu)  Case No.71 of 2014 u/s 7, 9(1) read with section 30 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, as amended up-to-date now pending in the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Tribunal No.1, Lalmonirhat. At the opening of the hearing  of the Rule before a Division Bench it appeared that the basic question upon which the proceedings was challenged is the question of maintainability of a <em>naraji</em> petition within the scheme of section 27 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000. Since the question already gave rise to conflicting decisions the matter was referred to the Hon’ble Chief Justice for constituting a Full  Bench as per Rule 1 of Chapter VII of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh (High Court Division) Rules, 1973 so that the issue may be settled along with other related issues raised by the petitioner. Hon’ble Chief Justice in his turn was pleased to constitute this Bench for the purpose. </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Back on facts, it appears that a victim of rape is the complainant. She first approached the local <em>thana</em> in order to lodge a complaint but having been refused therefrom took recourse to the second option and filed the instant complaint-petition in the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Tribunal (hereafter referred to as “the Tribunal”) No.1, Lamonirhat. In the complaint-petition she said, <em>inter alia</em>, that she was a student of Haziganj BM College. On 10.6.2014 after attending classes she made a detour to visit the house of her friend Hosne Ara. On her way back home present petitioner Anjuara took her to Lalmonirhat by persuasion and from there to an unknown house at Rangpur. Other accused including accused Bipul Chandra Barmon, the principal accused, joined them on the way. At Rangpur accused Anju (present petitioner) compelled the victim under threat to stay with accused Bipul in a room at night. As the night advanced Bipul insisted her to have sex with him but failed at the face of resistance. As the night advanced the victim got growingly tired and exhausted under persistent pressure meted out to her. Taking the advantage Bipul finally overpowered and raped her at late hours of the night. Accused Bipul thereafter stayed in the same room with her following three nights and raped her on several occasions. On 13.6.2014 Bipul went away and remained untraced. He came back on 15.6.14 and took the victim to Dhaka and stayed there in a rented house with the victim as husband and wife. The victim gradually accepted the incident as <em>fait accompli</em> but kept pressing the accused to complete the formality of marriage. As the pressure mounted accused Bipul suddenly disappeared leaving her alone in the house. On 15.8.2014 the victim was recovered by her brother from there and brought back home.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Tribunal having received the complaint- petition sent the same to the Upa Zila Vice-Chairman to inquire and submit report. The Vice-Chairman inquired into and submitted his report against five out of the six persons against whom, according to him, a <em>prima facie</em> case was found established. The sixth one is the petitioner whose release from the case was recommended. Soon thereafter a <em>naraji</em> petition was filed by the complainant. Learned Judge having heard the parties and perusing the records found a <em>prima facie</em> case against the petitioner also. He accordingly rejected the recommendation for release and   took cognizance of offence against all the six accused persons named in the complaint petition including this petitioner. Learned Judge while taking cognizance against all the accused made the following observations:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “<strong>নথি পর্যালোচনায় ও সার্বিক বিবেচনায় দেখা যায় যে তদমত্ম প্রতিবেদনে মামলার বাদিণীর অভিযোগের বাসত্মব প্রতিফলন ঘটে নাই। ঐঈষক্ষ্মপ অবস্থায় অত্র ট্রাইবুনালের নিকট সমেত্মাসজনক প্রতীয়মান না হওয়ায় তদমত্মকারী কর্মকর্তা কর্তৃক দাখিলী  আসামী ইবঝমঁবষবকে মামলার দায় হইতে অব্যহতির  সুপারিশ সম্বলিত অংশটুকু অগ্রাহ্য করা হইল। ’’</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner being the person grossly affected by the order obtained this Rule. The petitioner, in her bid to get the proceedings quashed raised basically three contentions. First<strong>,</strong> there is no scope for <em>naraji</em> petition within the scheme of section 27 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as <strong>“</strong>the Ain”), therefore,  the learned Judge, in taking cognizance of the offence on <em>naraji</em> petition committed an error of law occasioning failure of justice. Second, <em>naraji</em> petition is, for all practical purposes, a fresh complaint, therefore, taking cognizance without examining the complainant u/s 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as “the Code”) is illegal.  Third<strong>,</strong> had there been scope under clause (1Ka) of section 27(1) for investigation by police or any other specialized agencies having knowledge and experience of investigation truth behind the allegation could have been discovered on sufficient materials and the learned judge would have been satisfied about the innocence of the petitioner and finally, the complaint petition does not disclose any offence, hence, initiation and continuation of the proceeding is nothing but an abuse of the process of court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Before we embark upon the merit of the contentions it would be apt to turn back on three of the series of decisions handed down by different Benches of this Division touching upon various questions-all, someway or other, relatable to  <em>naraji</em>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>Abdul Halim (Md) v State</em></strong>, 60 DLR 393, the victim lodged an information with the local police station  alleging commission of rape. After investigation police submitted ‘final report’ (Referred to as such in the Police Regulations Bengal, 1943, when the investigation officer submits report recommending release of any or all of the accused having found no <em>prima facie</em> case justifying a sent-up for trial ). The informant filed a <em>naraji</em> petition against the final report. Learned Judge of the Tribunal accepted the <em>naraji</em> petition and took cognizance of the offence. Trial was held and the accused was found guilty of the offence and accordingly sentenced to suffer imprisonment. In appeal no question of legality as to cognizance taken on <em>naraji</em> was directly raised. A Division Bench of this Division while deciding the appeal in the positive did not see anything wrong in <em>naraji</em> petition filed in a Nari-o-Shishu Case rather explained the position of final report and <em>naraji</em> petition by reference to a number of cases (mostly under  the Penal Code decided in the context of the Code of Criminal Procedure) and held that <u>‘on receipt of <em>naraji</em> petition the Tribunal may take cognizance of the offence if it is found reasonable and proper or direct further investigation.</u>  (<em>Underlines are mine</em>)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Next comes the case of <strong><em>Ruma Khatun v Md. Abdun Noor</em></strong> (unreported), Cr. Appeal No. 7782 of 2011, a case of rape. The victim having failed to persuade the local <em>thana</em> to accept her complaint filed a petition of complaint in the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Tribunal. The Tribunal sent the petition back to the police station for investigation. The investigation yielded negative report recommending release of the accused. The report was responded by a <em>naraji</em> petition. Upon the <em>naraji</em> petition further investigation  was directed. Further inquiry yielded the same result recommending release of the accused.  Naraji petition was also filed against the second final report.  This time the Tribunal rejected the <em>naraji</em> petition and accepted the final report consequently the accused was discharged. <u>A Division Bench of this Division, while disposing of the appeal that was preferred by the complainant, took no exception of <em>naraji</em> petition rather in view of the facts disclosed in the <em>naraji</em> petition was satisfied about existence of a <em>prima facie</em> case to be tried and held  that the Tribunal rejected the <em>naraji</em> petition mechanically on the report tainted with bias and  in total disregard of the facts that there were enough materials on records, namely, medical report and affidavits sworn by the witnesses in support of the case</u>. (<em>Underlines are mine</em>.)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In both the cases courts appear to have dealt with naraji-petitions in a manner as if the same were filed in a case under the Penal Code leaving an impression that, so far <em>naraji</em> petition is concerned, there is no difference between cases under the Penal Code and under a special law like Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain.  <em>Naraji</em>, in <em>nari-o-shishu</em> cases, has thus derived indirect approval in almost all the cases decided by different Benches of this Court as the question of maintainability of <em>naraji</em> never came up directly as an issue in the context of the Ain, as it did, in the case of Hafizur Rahman (<em>infra</em>).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>Hafizur Rahman v State</em></strong>, (unreported), Cr. Miscellaneous Case No.27249 of 2013, the victim girl approached the local police station with an allegation of rape against the accused. The Officer-in-Charge refused to record a case on the complaint. <u>The Tribunal sent the complaint-petition  back  to police station with a direction to treat the same as first information report and investigate</u>. Police after investigation submitted final report recommending action against the alleged victim under section 17 of the Ain. This was followed by a <em>naraji</em> petition filed by the informant. In this case, amongst others, the question that came to the fore is the question of maintainability of <em>naraji</em> petition within the scheme of section 27 of the Ain.  A Division Bench of this court upon a comprehensive discussion took the view that in cases initiated upon complaint <u>Tribunal is not empowered to take cognizance upon <em>naraji</em> petition which being redundant in the context of the law.</u> The  Court proceeded further to hold that <u>question of examination of the complainant does not arise nor the Tribunal is empowered to send the complaint to police for inquiry and in that view the report submitted by police is no report within the meaning of section 27(1Ka) (Ka) of the Ain</u>. No cognizance, therefore, can lawfully be taken on such report. (<em>Underlines are mine</em>).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The cast-iron bar on the competence of the Tribunal to entertain <em>naraji</em> petition and of sending complaint petition to the police station with direction to record a case as put in   <em>Hafizur Rahman </em>has virtually denuded the Tribunal of a time-honored practice recognized by  the courts of this sub-continent as a mechanism to cure an otherwise flawed investigation and curtailed the inherent discretion of the Tribunal, as a court, to send the complaint-petition to police station for recording a regular case, should necessity arise. At the same time the judgment not being comprehensively focused on the total scheme of section 27 virtually allowed  many other questions, often raised, specially touching upon power of the Tribunal in proceedings initiated on information given to the police station and in proceedings  initiated on complaint, <em>vis-à-vis, </em>scope of <em>naraji</em> in the scheme of section 27, to remain unanswered. Such as, <strong>a)</strong>  if cognizance is taken on the report contemplated under sub-section (1) of section 27  is <em>naraji</em> maintainable,  <strong>b)</strong> is the Tribunal competent to reject the report as aforesaid  and direct further investigation or,  where expedient,  judicial inquiry,  <strong>c) </strong>so far as the power of the Tribunal is concerned,  is there any difference between the proceedings started on <strong>Awf‡hvM</strong> (referred to hereinafter as “FIR”) as contemplated under  sub-section (1) and the one started on <strong>Awf‡hvM</strong>  (shortly, “complaint”) contemplated under clause (1Ka) of sub-section (1), <strong>d)</strong> is  the Tribunal  powerless  in matters of sending  back the complaint   to the police station even, in its  opinion,  an investigation should be made<strong> e) </strong>in a case started upon complaint,  is the Tribunal bound to be confined to  ‘inquiry-report’  and the ‘complaint’  for taking cognizance and devoid of power to take notice of <em>naraji</em>. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Ain is silent about the term ‘<em>naraji’</em>.  So is the case with the Code. But <em>naraji</em> is there to play its role as an important tool at the hands of the courts to test the <em>bona fide</em> of the police investigation and take necessary correctional measures in order that the true offenders cannot escape trial.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If I am not far wrong, <em>naraji</em> is largely a sub-continental phenomenon which owes its origin to the ever declining public confidence in police investigation and  found favour with the courts as a document specially focused on the flaws in investigation indicating possible ways to set things right. </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Naraji</em> petition, almost without exception, is filed by the informant of a case against the final report recommending release of any or all of the accused named in the first information report as a protest indicating flaws in the investigation and asking either for further investigation or judicial inquiry. In our socio-economic reality, lack of professionalism and susceptibility of the investigating officer to undue influence seems as much likely as to make it difficult for the courts to ignore the objection raised by the informant and rely on the credibility it ideally deserves.  <em>Naraji</em>, thus, came to be recognized by courts as a safeguard against ill-attempts directed to screening offenders upon extraneous considerations or against an inefficient and perfunctory investigation leaving scope for the criminals to go scot-free and gradually assumed the status of a fresh complaint by consistent judicial expositions with all the attendant formalities of a complaint petition contemplated in the Code. </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Naraji</em> is not to be confused with a partisan document by reason merely of the fact that it owes its origin in the grievance of a party. It is a document that works in aid of the court in its efforts to ascertain the nature and magnitude of the flaws, if any, in investigation and suggests the next course of action in detection mechanism. <em>Naraji </em>thus <em>has</em> turned into an instrumentality of justice germane to criminal jurisprudence. Curtailing the power of the court to take notice of <em>naraji</em> cannot, therefore, be possible without significantly impairing the power of a court to prevent investigation being misdirected with ulterior motive or flawed by inefficiency or inexperience. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">With the jurisprudence in mind, let us see whether section 27 of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000, (as amended upto date) can be construed to exclude <em>naraji</em> from its scheme as is sought to be canvassed on behalf of the petitioner. But before we turn to the scheme, we need to have a look through  the preamble of the Ain and two other sections having direct bearing upon the issue.  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The preamble reads as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   <strong>যেহেতু নারী ও শিশু নির্যাতনমূলক অপরাধসমূহ কঠোরভাবে দমনের উদ্দেশ্যে প্রয়োজনীয় বিধান প্রণয়ন করা সমীচীন ও প্রয়োজনীয়;</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><u>Section 18 of the Ain says</u>:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>18|  </strong><strong>অপরাধের তদন্ত। (১) ফৌজদারি কার্যবিধিতে ভিন্নতর যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, এই আইনের অধীন কোন অপরাধের তদন্ত-</strong><br/><strong>(ক) অভিযুক্ত ব্যক্তি অপরাধ সংঘটনের সময়ে হাতেনাতে পুলিশ কর্তৃক ধৃত হইলে বা অন্য কোন ব্যক্তি কর্তৃক ধৃত হইয়া পুলিশের নিকট সোপর্দ হইলে, তাহার ধৃত হইবার তারিখ হইতে পরবর্তী পনের কার্য দিবসের মধ্যে সম্পন্ন করিতে হইবে;

The Ain is in the sense a mixed legislation sought to be made as far as possible self-contained.  The preamble of the Ain suggests that the   law was enacted in order to effectively curb the crimes against women and children.  Under the enabling provisions of section 18(8) the Tribunal, <em>albeit</em> after examination of witnesses, may direct the controlling authority of the investigating officer to take necessary action against him, if it is satisfied that he, with intent to shield any offender, refrained from collecting evidence required to be collected or willfully omitted to examine any important witness. Sub-section (9) of the section empowers the Tribunal to issue direction to change the investigating officer and appoint a new one in his place if it finds expedient so to do <u>‘on the basis of an application’</u> or <u>‘any other information received’</u> from any source whatsoever.   Subject to anything   to the contrary appearing in the Ain section 25 makes the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure applicable to filing, investigation, trial and disposal of cases under the Ain. Under the section Tribunal is deemed to be a Court of Session and will have all powers of a Court of Session in matters of trial of any offence under the Ain. (<em>Underlines are mine</em>).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The aforesaid two sections read with the preamble and limitation clauses of the Ain  makes it amply clear that the legislature while making the law has taken adequate care to devise a more effective mechanism for detection of criminals responsible for commission of offences against women and children and ensure punishment of the offenders through speedier investigation and trial.  Furthermore, the Ain has made the Code applicable to filing, investigation, trial and disposal of the <em>nari-o-shishu nirjatan</em> cases and as abundant caution has equipped Tribunal with all the powers of the Court of Session in matters of trial of offences under the Ain. Nothing is there indicating exclusion of <em>naraji</em> rather the  Tribunal is obviously better placed  than the Court of Session in matters of control and supervision of investigation  so that it enjoys an additional power to take steps for changing the investigating officer on the basis of an application, irrespective of <em>naraji</em>, or on information received from any source whatsoever.  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Down to section 27, the centerline of the controversy.

Within the scheme of section 27 a proceedings under the Ain should ordinarily be initiated by lodging information in the police station. The second or, more appropriately, the alternative procedure sets in by default with a complaint-petition directly filed in the Tribunal subject to refusal by a police officer to accept the same. Sub-section (1), providing the first procedure, read with section 25 suggests that the Tribunal has been clothed with power wide enough to cover all the power of a Magistrate and of the Sessions judge rolled together in ignoring investigation-report with concomitant power to entertain <em>naraji</em> and sending back the case for further investigation or, (where practicable)  judicial inquiry. Sub-section (1) and (1Ga) of section 27 read with section 18 goes to show that the Tribunal is further equipped with power more robust than that of an ordinary criminal court in taking cognizance absolutely on its own satisfaction, <em>albeit</em> by assigning reason, gathered from any materials, irrespective of <em>naraji</em>, or information received in disregard of the final report submitted by police or the person authorized by the Government in this behalf. The enormously unqualified power of the Tribunal to take cognizance of offences on its own satisfaction in total disregard of everything means by necessary implication that the Tribunal enjoys power to take into consideration anything including the naraji-petition for its satisfaction without any formality attached to it in general law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">While draftsmanship went halfway through well enough in dressing-up the Tribunal with powers in keeping with legislative policy to effectively suppress the ever increasing offences against women and children the drafters suddenly  lapsed  into contextual oblivion and embarked upon a drastic cut-back on power  depriving  the Tribunal of its important armory  required for detection of crime and the criminals : a new segment of provisions including  clauses (1Ka) to (1Kha) were  engrafted in section 27  introducing procedure of cognizance to be taken on report submitted by a Magistrate or any other person assigned by the Tribunal so to do, on materials collected through ‘inquiry’ apparently leaving no scope for the Tribunal to make a direction for ‘investigation’ by police or other specialized investigating agencies, even in the peculiar facts of the case, the Tribunal is of the opinion that nothing less than an investigation is enough to discover the truth behind the offence. This paradigm shift  taken through semantically   incoherent  provisions   has practically given rise to two types of prosecutions in similar cases: one equipped with adequate materials collected through investigation conducted by professional investigators leaving the other only with a report submitted by a Magistrate or any other person assigned by the Tribunal, almost without any exception,  prepared on statements made by a handful of witnesses and the complaint, that too, if the report does support the allegations made in the complaint. In any case, if inquiry-report does not support the allegations made in the complaint the Tribunal is left with only complaint, nothing else as prosecution materials upon which trial may be held -an occasion in which success of prosecution may hardly, if ever, be expected. The textual shift or error fairly attributable to inept draftsmanship in effect divided the victims into clear two classes: fortunate and unfortunate. The victim whose case is accepted by police is fortunate as the trial, if any, would be held on enough materials collected through investigation whereas the one whose complaint was not accepted by police would have to depend on prosecution-materials at best comprising of statements of few witnesses recorded by Magistrate<u>/</u> any other person and the complaint-petition, <em>a</em> <em>fortiorari<u>,</u></em> if the report so submitted lends support to the complaint-version<strong>.</strong></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Save as the exception made in clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) of sub-section (1) of section 27  the phraseologies regained its contextual upbeat just from the next section, namely, section 28, which says, <em>inter alia</em>: ‘any party aggrieved  by an order, judgment or sentence passed by the Tribunal  may prefer an appeal in the High Court Division against the order, judgment or sentence adversely affecting him or her   which by its plain meaning suggests that the Ain, unlike the Code, did not limit  the right to  appeal only to the formal parties of the case instead has widened the same to the extent of persons directly affected by the order passed or any decision taken by the Tribunal exactly in keeping with the overriding power otherwise vested in the Tribunal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The reason for sudden exclusion of investigation and drastic curtailment of power  of the Tribunal made by clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) is nothing but refusal of ‘a police officer’ or an authorized person to receive the complaint alleging cognizable offences (all offences under the Ain are cognizable) where such refusal by police, without lawful excuse, is itself a  misconduct. The apparent ineptitude of the drafters in harmonizing the provisions with the context even with sub-section (1) of section 27 has not only stood in contrast with the legislative intent but also begged the question mooted here and many more crowding the courts with avoidable litigations. We think it apt to carve out the exclusionary clauses  from section 27 (already quoted) and reproduce here once again for a ready glance.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(১ক) কোন অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১)-এর অধীন <u>কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তিকে কোন অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন মর্মে হলফনামা সহকারে ট্রাইব্যুনালের নিকট অভিযোগ দাখিল করিলে</u> ট্রাইব্যুনাল অভিযোগকারীকে পরীক্ষা করিয়া-</strong><br/><strong>(ক) সন্তুষ্ট হইলে <u>অভিযোগটি অনুসন্ধানের (রহয়ঁরৎু) জন্য কোন ম্যাজিস্ট্রেট কিংবা অন্য কোন ব্যক্তিকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করিবেন এবং অনুসন্ধানের জন্য নির্দেশপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি অভিযোগটি অনুসন্ধান করিয়া সাত কার্য দিবসের মধ্যে ট্রাইব্যুনালের নিকট রিপোর্ট প্রদান করিবেন;</u></strong><br/><strong>(খ) সন্তুষ্ট না হইলে অভিযোগটি সরাসরি নাকচ করিবেন।</strong><br/><strong>(১খ) উপ-ধারা (১ক) এর অধীন রিপোর্ট প্রাপ্তির পর কোন ট্রাইব্যুনাল যদি এই মর্মে সন্তুষ্ট হয় যে,</strong><br/><strong>(ক) <u>অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যওিুকে কোন অপরাধের  অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন এবং অভিযোগের সমর্থনে প্রাথমিক সাক্ষ্য প্রমাণ আছে সেই ক্ষেত্রে  ট্রাইব্যুনাল উওু রিপোর্ট ও অভিযোগের ভিত্তিতে অপরাধটি বিচারার্থ গ্রহণ করিবেন;</u></strong><br/><strong>(খ) অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যওিুকে কোন অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন মর্মে প্রমাণ পাওয়া যায় নাই কিংবা অভিযোগের সমর্থনে কোন প্রাথমিক সাক্ষ্য প্রমাণ পাওয়া যায় নাই সেই ক্ষেত্রে ট্রাইব্যুনাল অভিযোগটি নাকচ করিবেন;</strong><br/><strong>(<em>Underlines are mine)</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">If we take a bit of pains in reading through the provisions particularly of  sub-clauses (Ka) of both the clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) of sub-section (1) we notice a legal obligation created for the Tribunal to take recourse to ‘inquiry’ for collection of evidence without leaving option for investigation to put in place,  in case it is needed. This means the Tribunal, which was supposed to be fortified by power more robust than usual, is relegated to a position weaker than that of a Magistrate who, in the circumstances, can direct the police to treat the complaint as first information report and investigate. The proposition upon which the   Tribunal’s discretion exercised <em>ex debito justiciae </em>is curtailed stands sharply opposed to criminal jurisprudence. Secondly, sub-clause (Ka) of clause (1Ka) and sub-clause (Ka) of clause (1Kha) read together may fairly be taken to mean that the Tribunal is confined to the report submitted by a Magistrate or any other person in taking cognizance and holding trial on the basis of aforesaid two documents. It is totally unclear how on earth a clueless, secret or mysterious crime which needs in-depth investigation by professional investigator or an specialized agency for detection can be detected by a Magistrate, more so, through ‘inquiry’ within the meaning of the Code and for that matter how the Tribunal, meant to be instrumental to curbing dreadful, organized and sometimes high-tech crimes against women and children, will proceed with trial depending on the meager  materials, if any,  that can be collected within the limit  of ‘inquiry’ by a Magistrate or any other lay person as indicated in the law. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The apparent power  imbalance between the  two segments of section 27 created by textual shift has made room, amongst others,  for  argument that in the scheme of section 27, at least so far as it relates to the alternative procedure, there is no scope for <em>naraji</em>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Ain being a social defense legislation (as the similar statutes are often so called) the Tribunal created under it is designed to effectively curb the growing crimes against women and children by ensuring flawless investigation or (where practicable) inquiry and speedy trial. No contextually defiant and discordant phrases, expressions and terminologies found place in the law, however clear in meaning, cannot be put to strict literal construction divorced from context, without betraying the cause of the legislation. It is precisely for the reason, sub-clauses (Ka) of both clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) need be put to strained construction so as to be synchronized with the rest of the statute for that matter the purpose of the  Ain. Any otherwise a number of absurd and illogical consequences is bound to follow.  <strong>Fi</strong>r<strong>st, </strong>if the report is in the negative the Tribunal would be left with no materials except the complaint to decide the fate of the case. Thus a hardened criminal committing the offence alleged may find an easy exit to walk away from punishment or even trial. <strong>Second</strong>, making the Tribunal confined to two documents only would invariably enhance the importance of the report and thereby render the inquiry more susceptible to undue influence often difficult to ward off resulting in miscarriage of justice.  <strong>Third</strong>, Tribunal’s power as a court to circumvent the vices of inquiry with the help of other materials, like <em>naraji</em>, or any information received would be significantly impaired for no good reasons. <strong>Finally</strong>, and most importantly, the opinion of the Tribunal would be subjected to the opinion of the inquiry- officer if the Tribunal is bound down to the inquiry-report-a proposition unknown to criminal jurisprudence.   </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, in the alternative procedure the proceedings is basically dependant on ‘inquiry’ as against ‘investigation’ where there is no arrest, interrogation,  police dossier, case diary, <em>alamats</em>, expert opinion, inquest, post-mortem reports etc. <em>Naraji,</em> in the circumstances, remains to be the most crucial document for the Tribunal to test the credibility of the inquiry-report. Strict literal interpretation of a contextually inconsistent provision and/or expression seeking to exclude <em>naraji</em> is, therefore, too ingenious to be accepted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">One of the basic principles of common law is, law should serve the public interest. By the same strain, Parliament, as a body representing the people, is presumed not to intend absurd or illogical result from the applications of its enactments. Consequently, interpretation of statute finally turns on discovery of the intention of legislature.  In this juncture I might well borrow the words of Fancis Bennion in <strong><em>Understanding Common Law Legislation: Drafting &amp; Interpretation</em></strong><em> (First Indian Reprint, 2004, Page 39-41):</em> ‘The historic purpose of statutory interpretation is to arrive at the presumed intention of the legislators in promulgating the enactment… The so-called literal rule of interpretation nowadays dissolves into a rule that the text is the primary indication of legislative intention.. .There are occasions when, as Baron Parke said, the language of the legislature must be modified to avoid inconsistency with its intention…There are four reasons which justify stretching the literal meaning 1) where consequences of applying a literal construction are so obviously undesirable that Parliament cannot really have intended them 2) an error in the text which falsifies Parliament’s intention 3) a repugnance between the words of the enactment and those of some other relevant enactments and 4) changes in external circumstances since the enactment was originally drafted.’ </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Decisions of the superior courts of the common law world including our sub-continent reflecting the aforesaid principles abound the pages of law reports. The following are but few: </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In <strong><em>Attorney General for Canada v Hallet &amp;Carey Ltd</em></strong>. [1952] AC 427, it is held that- ‘Of all the rules of interpretation, the paramount rule remains, laws should be construed to carry out the intention of legislature,’ and where in the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words legislative intent is missing it must be construed by reference to the context of the whole Act.  In the words of Francis Bennion occurring in ‘<em>Understanding Common Law Legislation</em>’ (<em>supra</em>, page 50):<br/><em>‘Where the literal meaning of the enactment goes narrower than the object of the legislator, the court may need to apply rectifying construction widening that meaning. Nowadays it is regarded as not in accordance with legal policy to allow a drafter’s ineptitude to prevent justice (sic) being done and the legislator’s intention implemented’ </em><br/>         In<em> <strong>SA Haroon v Collector of Customs, </strong></em>11 DLR (SC) 200, Pakistan Supreme Court held:<br/><em>“All rules of interpretation have been devised as aids to the discovery of the legislative intents behind an enactment. Where the words are plain and unambiguous, that intent can best be judged by giving full effect to the ordinary grammatical meaning of those words. But when this is not the case an attempt should be made to discover the true intent by considering the relevant provisions in the context of the whole Act in which it appears and by having regard to the circumstances in which the enactment came to be passed. The previous state of law, the mischief sought to be suppressed and the new remedy provided are relevant factors to be given due consideration</em>”<br/>         In a relatively recent case, <strong><em>K Anbazhagan v Superintendent of Police</em></strong><em>, AIR 2004 SC 524,</em> Indian Supreme Court observed:<br/><em>“Every law is designed to further the ends of justice and not to frustrate it in technicalities. The court should construe a statute to advance the cause of the statute not to defeat it.”</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Apart from what is said above, strict literalism, one of the principles of statutory interpretation deeply rooted into the parliamentary supremacy in England, is difficult to be fitted into our constitutional dispensation, even though the language of law is clear beyond doubt but produces absurd and illogical result.   Here in our jurisdiction Constitution is supreme and every piece of legislation made by Parliament must follow the parameters of the American due process principles enshrined in Art.31, in order to qualify as law as well as being enforceable by the Supreme Court.   Law, therefore, cannot travel far beyond its context and afford to be arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable yielding absurd and illogical consequences.  When purpose of the enactment is clear strained construction may legitimately be put to any expression or phrase used inadvertently. It is held in <strong><em>Sutherland Publishing Co. v Caxton</em></strong> <strong><em>Publishing Co</em></strong><em>. [1938] ch 174,</em> that‘- ‘ Where the purpose of an enactment is clear, it is often legitimate, to put a strained interpretation upon some words which have been inadvertently used’.  Reverting to Bennion: “ The truth is that, sometimes the argument against a literal construction are so compelling that even though the words are not, within the rules of language, capable of another meaning they must be given one”. [<strong><em>Understanding Common Law Legislation, </em></strong><em>supra p 43</em>].  Since the enactments in question apparently go narrower than the purpose of the law we have no hesitation to reject the contentions built upon strict literalism in interpretation totally isolated from the context. The language of clauses (1Ka) and (1Kha) must, therefore, be harmonized with the rest of the statute and be construed to include power not only co-equal with powers   provided by section 27(1) but also the Tribunal must be taken to include powers to take notice of <em>naraji</em> as well as   all other powers incidental to carrying out the purpose of the Ain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Be that as it may, the controversy is set at naught by clause (1Ga) of section 27 which spelt out in no uncertain terms that notwithstanding any recommendation made in the report submitted either by police/authorized person or by Magistrate/any other person   as contemplated in sub-section (1) and clause (1Ka) respectively, not sending the accused for trial, the Tribunal, if considers proper for ends of justice, may take cognizance of the offence against the accused assigning its reasons thereof.  The language of the law leaves no doubt that the Tribunal, as distinguished from the Court of Session or the Magistrate, enjoys an added statutory power to reject the investigation/ inquiry report and take cognizance on its own satisfaction.  It follows, by parity of reasoning, that the Tribunal which is free to take cognizance regardless of the nature of the report is free to take into notice any information supplied under any name, <em>naraji</em> or otherwise, if the same proves to be of use in testing the veracity of the report and by necessary implication enjoined with power to direct a further investigation or inquiry (where practicable) regardless of how the proceedings was started, upon FIR or complaint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Viewed in the light of expositions made hereinabove, it logically follows that Tribunal is well within its competence to entertain <em>naraji</em> leaving no room for argument that there is no scope of <em>naraji</em> petition in the scheme of section 27 of the Ain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now two different but closely interrelated questions that fall to be addressed, that is, whether <em>naraji</em> is to be treated as a fresh complaint and if so whether the complainant is required to be examined u/s 200 of the Code when it is filed in a case under Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The answer is not very far to seek. It is implicit in the language of sub-section (1Ga) of section 27 of the Ain. As we have already stated, the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjaton Damon Ain, 2000, is a special and stringent legislation made with intent to detect the persons alleged to have committed crimes against women and/or children and to suitably punish them   through speedier investigation, inquiry and trial. With the end in view the Ain, unlike the Code, has taken care to equip  the Tribunal, as far as possible,  with unqualified power to take cognizance of offences on its own satisfaction gathered from any materials (<em>naraji</em> or otherwise) regardless of what is said in the report. In the realm of almost unqualified power directed to achieving the object of law, <em>naraji</em> stands to lose its ordinary legal signification and is relegated merely to the status of a document supplying important information indicating flaws in the investigation or inquiry making the formalities in taking notice of it totally redundant. There is, therefore, no scope in the Ain, to ascribe the status of fresh complaint to <em>naraji</em>-petition.  In the same vein, examination or non-examination of the informant/complainant under section 200 for taking <em>naraji</em>-petition into consideration is of no consequence. Examination of complainant, thus, being unnecessary, non-examination under section 200 does not furnish any ground for quashing.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The contention finally raised is whether section 27(1Ka) of the Ain takes away power of the Tribunal to send back the petition of complaint  to the police station, for recording a regular case and proceed with investigation. The issue incidentally came up and already decided down the line, however, without any special reference to the question pointedly raised. Mr. Raquibul Haque, learned Advocate, tried to argue by reference to the special wordings of  section 27(1Ka), that the section puts a clear bar on the Tribunal’s power to send back the petition to the police, as according to him, fair investigation cannot be expected from an agency that refused to accept the complaint as a case.  He sought to lend support from the case of <strong><em>Sirajul Islam v State </em></strong>reported in 17 BLC 740.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">No doubt the point raised demands independent treatment in view of its importance. Nevertheless, before we go for addressing the contention we need to dwell in the concept of ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ at a certain length. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan Damon Ain, 2000, does not define any of the terms. Naturally, the pre-existing law i.e., the Code of Criminal Procedure, will come into play in filling up the gap as per settled principles of interpretation. So far as the word’ investigation’ occurring in the Ain is concerned, the Code will apply specially by virtue of section 25 of the Ain.  Section 4(k) of the Code describes ‘inquiry’ as one- ‘<em>that includes</em> <em>every inquiry other than a trial conducted under the Code by a Magistrate or Court.’ </em> Section 4(l) describes ‘investigation’ as one<strong>-‘</strong><em>that</em> <em>includes all the proceedings under the Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a police officer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorized by Magistrate in this behalf</em>. Since the meaning of the words ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ appearing in the Ain borrow their meaning from the Code there is no difference of meaning of those words occurring in the Code and in the Ain. Nevertheless, the word ‘inquiry’ appearing in section 27(1Ka) (Ka), in view of its special wordings, seems to differ, if at all, in degree from ‘inquiry’ within the scheme of the Code. An inquiry within the meaning of the Code, especially when follows a <em>naraji</em> petition, is generally an <em>indoor </em>activity of <em>quasi</em> judicial nature conducted by a Magistrate or court that includes recording of oral evidence adduced by a handful of witnesses, in most cases selected by the informant, in order to examine whether there is <em>prima facie</em> materials to justify   cognizance which has nothing to do with visiting place of occurrence, search, seizure, detection and tracking down accused, arrest, interrogation, collection of evidence on ground-level including expert opinion etc. as is done during investigation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, “inquiry” as contemplated under section 27(1Ka)(Ka) may fairly be construed to include spot- visit and  recording statements of  witnesses at the field level  before  preparing a report to be submitted in the Tribunal. Here the inquiry- officer is either a Magistrate or ‘any other person’ assigned so to do by the Tribunal. It is knowledge <em>a priori </em>that a Magistrate is not a professional investigator. So is the case with the persons generally assigned by the Tribunal to make the inquiry, such as, the local Upa-Zila Chairman, Vice-Chairman (as is the case here) or a Government officer<strong>.  </strong>Furthermore, it is difficult to ascribe an extended meaning to the phrase, “any other person” so as to include an officer belonging to police or any other investigating agencies for the simple reason that had the legislature, by the phrase, meant to include any officer belonging to any of those agencies it had no reason not to specify the name of the agency. More importantly, if it is an ‘inquiry’ with its legal import as aforesaid, persons assigned matters a little because of the fact that inquiry made even by a member of an investigating agency is an ‘inquiry’ not ‘investigation’ and being circumscribed by its inherent limitations is incapable of making any significant difference.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is, thus, clear that the words ‘inquiry’ and ‘investigation’ are not words meant to bear the same connotations in the Code as well as in the Ain. They finally remain to be distinctly different in connotations to be taken recourse to   by the Magistrate or the Tribunal according as the nature of a particular case, they respectively sit on, permits.  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">As is suggested by its definition read with chapter XIV of the Code investigation is an independent discipline to be mastered by long training and experience, adequate knowledge of criminal law, law of evidence, forensic science, art of tracking down the suspects and of    interrogation and priorities in collection of evidence (material, documentary and oral) including expert-opinion enough to establish interlinkage between the offence and the offender. Investigation may be hidden or open unbounded by territorial limits involving various scientific methods, instruments and devices to be used in order to unearth the secret behind the crime.  Investigation knows no time limit except sheer professionalism of performance and untiring efforts of the investigating officer directed to discovering the truth behind a crime, often clueless and shrouded with mystery.  With the progress of science and technology crimes are also gaining newer and newer dimensions. Dreadful offences against women and children, including killing and grievous hurt throwing acid or other corrosive substance are being regularly recorded.  Cases of rape and gang-rape have risen to an epidemic scale. Routine rape over months under constant threat of posting nude images of young girls in the website often resulting in suicide committed by the victims has become a regular phenomenon. Women and children trafficking is now a subject of gang operation having international network. Extra-marital conception of unmarried girls, question of paternity of the baby and identification of the real criminal have posed a threat to social harmony. The offences are often so complicated, clueless and deep- rooted into influential quarters that nothing less than a full-scale investigation by a professional investigator is enough to unearth the truth behind them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Investigation is a goal- oriented mission, like a tiger chasing a deer, not to stop short of the target and must be allowed exactly as much time as it needs in its bid to reach the target. Statutory limitation giving deadline for the report is, therefore, bound to produce abortive and distorted result to the advantage of the true offenders. Investigation being a process that follows its own rules must be allowed to go unhindered unless its goal is reached. What is important is not to squeeze a report within a deadline but constant vigilance by the supervisory authority to see whether the investigation is going in right order and in right pace and take drastic measures against the  investigating officer should any laches, negligence or foul-play on his part  is noticed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The factual perspective illustrates the difference between the two terms and makes it amply clear that they are not mechanisms to be used interchangeably irrespective of the nature of the cases. Investigation must be directed to be carried out either by police or by any other specialized agency where facts of a particular case requires the Tribunal so to do. A police officer is not police. Refusal by him to accept the complaint need not be construed as refusal by police. If in the peculiar facts of a case Tribunal is satisfied that nothing less than a threadbare investigation is needed for detection of the crime and the criminals it has no choice but to exercise its inherent power and send back the complaint- petition to the police station with direction to treat the same as an FIR and cause investigation to be made by any competent police officer (other than the one who refused to accept the complaint) or by an officer belonging to any other specialized investigating agency. The power to make such direction must not be limited to any stage or difference of title of the information upon which the proceedings was started, FIR or complaint precisely for the reason that justice is the <em>raison d’ệtre</em> of a court or tribunal and no law, however clear in meaning, seeking to deter the court/tribunal in passing any order for securing ends of justice can stand without being indicted. Direction may be made on receipt of the complaint-petition or even after receiving inquiry- report if the report, in the opinion of the Tribunal, suggests that the facts are not as obvious and plain as is narrated in the complaint petition and the inquiry-report is not enough to support a fruitful prosecution. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Over and above, police is duty bound to receive complaint alleging commission of cognizable offence and cannot refuse it without lawful excuse. Since all the offences under the Ain are cognizable arbitrary refusal by police to accept the complaint alleging commission of any of them amounts to misconduct. It is an absurd proposition to suppose that mere refusal by a police officer or in other words, dereliction of duty of a police officer or for that matter an authorized person may be taken to create a legal binding upon the Tribunal to take recourse to inquiry-procedure although, in its opinion, investigation should be directed in the peculiar facts of the case.  This is a proposition which militates against the ultimate authority of the Tribunal to take its own decision and runs contrary to the ‘last say’ doctrine. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">It may not be out of place to mention here that a Magistrate or ‘any other person’ for that matter a Judge, how high soever, is not an expert in investigation. They are not persons, merely because of their higher credibility in the society, to act as a substitute for a competent police officer or a member of other investigating agencies nor a direction for inquiry by one or more of them may be given interchangeably with investigation regardless of the nature of the case. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The case of <strong><em>Sirajul Islam</em></strong> (<em>supra</em>), sought to be relied upon by the learned Advocate is clearly distinguishable because the issue in that case was whether the phrase “any other person” occurring in section <em>27(1Ka) (Ka) includes</em> a police officer or not and their Lordships answered the question in the negative. We see no difference between the view taken by their Lordships and the one taken by us on the point in the sense, in our view, if it is ‘inquiry’ a person merely by virtue of being a police officer is of no consequence.  Learned Advocate seemingly missed the position that here we are not on interpretation of the phrase “any other person” occurring in section 27(1Ka) (Ka) but on acceptability of the proposition that mere refusal by   a police officer leaves the Tribunal with no choice but to go for inquiry. The citation, therefore, is misplaced in the context and is of no avail for the petitioner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The last and the final contention raised as a faint attempt to show that the allegation does not constitute any offence fades away as a cry in wilderness.  We have meticulously gone through the complaint petition. Unfortunately for the petitioner, we notice her name consistently appearing throughout the complaint-petition indicating her direct involvement (true or false) in the commission of the offence. There is obviously a strong <em>prima facie</em> case against the petitioner to be tried.  The report submitted by the Vice-Chairman of the local Upa-Zila Parishad is clearly biased and the Tribunal has rightly taken cognizance of the offence against the petitioner by rejecting   the report. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>To sum up:</u></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Naraji</em> petition filed by the informant/complainant or any other person aggrieved against any report within the meaning of section 27 of the Ain,   submitted by police, Magistrate or any person authorized by the Government or appointed by the Tribunal is maintainable and the Tribunal is competent to take notice of the <em>naraji</em>-petition for its own satisfaction about the acceptability of the investigation or inquiry-report and as an aid to the process taking cognizance. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The informant/complainant or person aggrieved filing <em>naraji</em> petition against investigation/inquiry report within the meaning of section 27 of the Ain is  not required to be  examined u/s 200 of the Code for any purpose.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On receipt of the complaint the Tribunal may, if thinks fit, withhold direction for inquiry as contemplated under sub-clause (Ka) of section 27(1Ka) and send the complaint-petition back to the police station for recording a regular case, with direction to cause the investigation to be made by any competent police officer, other than the one who refused to accept the complaint, or direct any other investigating agency to investigate.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Without prejudice to the findings made in the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal may, if it appears after receiving the inquiry-report that the facts are not as plain and obvious as narrated in the petition of complaint and an inquiry is not enough for discovery of truth behind the offence, send the complaint-petition to the local police station with direction to cause an investigation to be made by a competent police officer, other than the one who refused to accept the same, or otherwise direct any other investigating agency to investigate, and report.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">For what we have stated above, we see no merit in the Rule. In the result, the Rule is discharged. The order of stay granted earlier is hereby vacated. The Tribunal is directed to proceed with the trial of the case in accordance with law.<br/>         Communicate at once.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

For the Opposite Parties </em></strong><div style="text-align: center;"><br/><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong><u>Soumendra Sarker, J:</u></strong><br/>The Rule was issued calling upon the opposite party No. 1 to show cause as to why the impugned judgment and order dated 18.11.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, in Title Suit No.201 of 2013 rejecting the application filed by the defendants No. 1-3 under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure should not be set aside and/or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts leading to the issuance of the Rule in a nutshell can be stated thus that the present opposite party No.1 as plaintiff instituted the original Title Suit being No.201 of 2013 in the Court of learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka for declaration of title and recovery of <em>khash</em> possession in the suit property contending <em>inter alia</em> that the disputed property had been owned and possessed by the plaintiff in his exclusive 16 <em>annas</em> share. In the disputed land there exist 04(four) shops of the plaintiff in which the tenants are one Md. Shafiullah in shop No. 1 and in shop No.2 the other tenant was one Monjur Mia and  the shops No.3 and 4 respectively were possessed by the plaintiff’s tenants Manju Mia and Rafique Mia. The defendants No. 1-3 claiming the property as of their own from their predecessor-in-interest Dr. Sirajul Islam. The remaining defendants No. 4-8 are also claiming title in the disputed property on the basis of their papers. The further case of the plaintiff is such that the defendants to the suit denying the plaintiff’s title dispossessed the plaintiff from the suit property including his shops  on 03.12.2009. The defendant’s claim in the disputed property on the basis of waqf is baseless, at which the title of the plaintiff has been clouded. To dispel that cloud the plaintiff instituted the original suit for declaration of the title and recovery of <em>khash</em> possession.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The contrary case of the defendants No.1-3 in short is thus that the plaintiff to the suit having no manner of right, title, interest and possession in the disputed property on the basis of false allegation filed the original suit and the defendants had been owning and possessing the disputed properties including the shops therein in their own interest and knowledge of all from the very beginning. The further case of the defendants is such that the plaintiff’s suit is barred by the principle of <em>res-judicata</em> as for the same suit-premises earlier a Title Suit being No.158 of 2010 have been filed against the same parties and the earlier suit have been dismissed on contest vide judgment and decree dated 31.07.2012.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During pendency of this suit the defendant-petitioners filed an application under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the trial court for rejection of the plaint on the ground that in respect of the self-same suit properties earlier the plaintiff in the 3<sup>rd</sup>  court of Assistant Judge, Dhaka filed a Title Suit being No.158 of 2010 and in that suit the plaintiff have failed to establish his case and also failed to prove his right, title and possession in the disputed premises. As a result of which the learned Assistant Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka by his judgment and dismissal decree dated 31.07.2012 dismissed the suit on contest and as such the present suit is not tenable in the eye of law which is barred by the principle of <em>res-judicata. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Against the aforesaid application for rejection of the plaint the plaintiff-opposite party filed a written objection on the ground that the application for rejection of the plaint is liable to be rejected inasmuch as there is no scope to entertain the said application under VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff-opposite parties in their written objection specifically contended that the principle of <em>res-judicata</em> is not applicable in the instant case and the defendants out of ill-motive only to harass the plaintiff have preferred such application for rejection of plaint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned trial court viz. the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka by the impugned judgment and order dated 18.11.2013 hearing the parties to the suit rejected the application under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order the defendant-petitioners have preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule with an interim order of stay.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. M.G.H. Ruhullah the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the petitioners while Mr. N.A.M. Abdur Razzaque the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the plaintiff-opposite-party No. 1.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that in passing the impugned judgment and order dated 18.11.2013 the learned trial court committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision in not considering that the plaintiff to the suit prior to the present suit for declaration of title filed a Title Suit being No.158 of 2010 and in that suit the plaintiff prayed for eviction of the defendants from the suit land on the ground that the plaintiff is the owner of the suit land but the learned Senior Assistant Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka dismissed the suit on contest on 31.07.2012 and thus the present suit is barred by the principle of <em>res-judicata</em> as provided in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The learned Advocate further submits that the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka having failed to appreciate the actual proposition of law arrived at an erroneous view that the provision of law as incorporated in Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not applicable in the instant suit and it is a matter of evidence by virtue of which the matter agitated from the side of the defendants can be adjudicated and finally settled. The learned Advocate lastly submits that the learned trial court erred in law as well as in facts resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and as such the impugned judgment and order is not sustainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As against the aforesaid submissions of the learned counsel  of the petitioners the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff-opposite party opposing the Rule controverted the arguments advanced from the side of the learned Advocate of the petitioners and submits that the trial Judge, viz. the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka during passing the impugned judgment and order committed no illegality or irregularity. The learned Advocate further submits that in the instant suit at the present moment there is no scope to entertain such application under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and it is apparent from the face of the papers that the earlier suit which was filed by the plaintiff in the third court of learned Assistant Judge, Dhaka being Title Suit No.158 of 2010 was not between the same parties and the matter-in-issues are quite different and the points for determination on which that suit was disposed of are different with that of the present suit. The learned Advocate also submits that the earlier suit was not a suit for declaration of title and recovery of <em>khash</em> possession. Hence; the provision laid down in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure is very much inconsistent for it’s application in the instant suit as the principle of Resjudicata itself provides that, “No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a court competent to try subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised and has been heard and finally decided by such court.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, the former suit being Title Suit No.158 of 2010 was quite different and the matter for adjudication therein is not identical with the present suit being Title Suit No.201 of 2013. The learned Advocate lastly submits that the learned trial Judge rightly held that at this stage; there is no scope for rejection of the plaint as the matter of <em>res-judicata </em>and the point of limitation is a mixed question of facts and law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates and have perused the impugned judgment and order passed by the learned trial Court i.e. the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No.201 of 2013 including the judgment and dismissal decree passed in the earlier suit being No.`158 of 2010 along with the connected papers as well as the application filed under Order VII rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having gone through the connected papers it transpires that the former suit <strong><em>i.e.</em></strong> the Title Suit No.158 of 2010 was instituted by the present plaintiff-opposite party No. 1 for eviction of tenant from the suit premises and the subsequent suit which is Title Suit No.201 of 2013 is a suit for declaration of title and recovery of <em>khash</em> possession. It further transpires from the connected papers that the learned trial Judge in the former suit framed four issues for decisions and those were as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>ক) অত্র মোকদ্দমাটি বর্তমান আকারে ও প্রকারে চলতে পারে কিনা?</strong><br/><strong>খ) অত্র মোকদ্দমার নালিশী সম্পত্তির সংশ্লিষ্টতায় বাদী বিবাদীদের মধ্যে মালিক ভাড়াটিয়ার সম্পর্ক বিদ্যমান ছিল বা আছে কি না ?</strong><br/><strong>গ) বাদী মালিক মর্মে অত্র মোকদ্দমা আনয়ন করার কষদয়ড় জঢ়তশধভ আছে কি না এবং বিবাদীগণ খেলাপী ভাড়াটিয়া গণ্যে উচ্ছেদযোগ্য কি না ?</strong><br/><strong>ঘ) অত্র মোকদ্দমা প্রার্থিত মতে বাদী প্রতিকার পেতে পারে কিনা?</strong><strong>’’</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">On the aforesaid four issues for determination the learned trial Court decided the fate of that suit  and dismissed the suit for want of necessary proof.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have come across from the instant Title Suit being No.201 of 2013 that this suit is a suit for declaration of title and recovery of khash possession. In the said suit the proposed issues from the side of the plaintiff were as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>১z অত্র মোকদ্দমা বর্তমান আকারে ও প্রকারে চলিতে পারে কি না?</strong><br/><strong>২z অত্র মোকদ্দমা পক্ষদোষে দুষ্ট কিনা ?</strong><br/><strong>৩z অত্র মোকদ্দমা তামাদি আইনে বারিত কি না ?</strong><br/><strong>৪z অত্র মোকদ্দমা রেস জুডিকেটা দ্বারা বারিত কি না ?</strong><br/><strong>৫z নালিশী সম্পত্তি ওয়াকÚফকৃত সম্পত্তি কি না ?</strong><br/><strong>৬z বাদী স্বত্ব সাব্যসÛত্র্রমে খাস দখল পাইতে পারে কি না ?</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, in view of the nature of the present suit the issues which have been proposed from the side of the plaintiff deserve consideration of the trial Judge inasmuch as the matter of controversy between the parties to the suit is encircled within the right, title, interest and the matter of possession and dispossession of the concerned parties. Besides this; the provision laid down in section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as many as five conditions, which are necessary to constitute <em>res-judicata</em>. These are : (i) “The matter directly and substantially in issue” in the former suit must be the same in the subsequent suit. (ii) The former suit must have been between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim. (iii) The parties in the subsequent suit must have litigated under the same title in the former suit. (iv) The Court which decided the former suit must have been competent to try the subsequent suit. (v) The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must have been heard and finally decided in the former suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On meticulous consideration of the application for rejection of the plaint in connection with the former suit and the present Suit being No.201 of 2013 it is apparent from the face of the papers that the matter in issues are not at all identical with the former suit and it is not directly or substantially in issues which has been heard and decided finally by a competent court of law. Apart from this; it transpires that the parties to the suits are not same. Beside this; it is a decided matter that the question of <em>res-judicata</em> as well as the question of limitation is a mixed question of facts and laws which is required to be adjudicated and decided during trial of the original suit. The learned trial Judge with regard to this; relying upon the decision of our Apex Court reported in 20 BLD(AD) 82 rightly held that there is no scope at the present stage to entertain such application under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having regard to the facts, circumstances and proposition of law we have every reason to inclined such a view that the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka committed no illegality in disallowing the application for rejection of the plaint, rather; he was quite justified in holding the view that this provision of law is not applicable in the instant suit. Hence; we find no substance in the Rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is discharged. The impugned judgment and order dated 18.11.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 5<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, in Title Suit No.201 of 2013 rejecting the application filed by the defendants No. 1-3 under Order VII, rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure stands good.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Let the order of stay granted earlier by this Court at the time of issuance of the Rule be vacated.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However; there will be no order as to costs.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">        Communicate the judgment and order immediately.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Criminal Appeal No. 1245 of 2003 was allowed acquitting appellant Emran Hossain alias Rana of the charge levelled against him under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Since the both the appeals arise out of the same judgment of the High Court Division, these were heard together and they are dealt with by this single judgment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The relevant facts are as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         On 08.08.2002 at about 5:30 p.m. victim Badsha Miah, elder son of the informant Nurjahan Begum, was sitting in front of his place of business, namely Badsha Community Center. At that time the informant along with her grandson P.W. 2 Rafiqul Islam @ Suman, was going to her daughter Jahanara’s house and on her way she talked with her son Badsha Miah. When the informant proceeded a little further, she saw Sohel, Billal, Manik and some other persons loitering on the right hand side in front of the market. As she proceeded further, she heard the sound of firing and looked back and saw accused Billal, Sohel and Manik shooting at her son Badsha Miah with the firearms in their hands. Then she cried out for help to save her son. Appellants Billal, Sohel and Manik along with others left the place of occurrence towards the South firing blank shots from their firearms. The informant and Sumon went to Badsha Miah and saw blood oozing from his nose, mouth, neck, belly and his entire body was soaked with blood. Badsha Miah fell on the ground from the chair. Yasin (P.W.3), Sumon(P.W.2) and Dukhu (P.W.4)took Badsha Miah to hospital in a baby-taxi. As the informant was crying, she was taken to her house. After a while she received information from the hospital that Badsha Miah succumbed to his injuries. When the other relatives came to the house of the informant, she along with her ‘putra’ (brother of daughter-in-law) Rezaul Karim (P.W.8), Sumon and Dukhu went to Kafrul Police Station to lodge the First Information Report (F.I.R.). Accordingly, Kafrul P.S. Case No.11 dated 08.08.2002 was started.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">After completion of the investigation police submitted charge-sheet No. 4 dated 17.01.2003 against the appellants and two others under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After submission of charge sheet the case record was transferred to the Druto Bichar Tribunal No. 4, Dhaka for trial and the case was re-numbered as Druto Bichar Tribunal Case No. 1 of 2003. Charge was framed under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against the appellants and under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code against the other two accused, which was read over to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During trial the prosecution examined as many as sixteen witnesses who were cross- examined by the defence, but the defence examined none. The defence case of the appellants, as it appears from the trend of cross-examination, was that they did not commit the offence as alleged by the prosecution and that they had been falsely implicated in the case. The appellants were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when again they pleaded their innocence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After hearing the parties and upon consideration of the evidence and materials on record, the Druto Bichar Tribunal, by the judgment and order dated 17.05.2006, convicted the appellants Shoel Dewan, Billal Hossain and Manik @ Omar Faruque under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to death. The Tribunal also found the other two co- accused guilty under sections 302/109 of the Penal Code and sentenced each of them to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Tk. 5,000/-each, in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year more.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Reference under section 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was made to the High Court Division for confirmation of the sentence of death, which was numbered as Death Reference No.41 of 2003. The appellants also filed Criminal Appeal No. 1181 of 2003 and Jail Appeal No. 295 of 2003 before the High Court Division. The co-convict Emran Hossain @Rana filed Criminal Appeal No. 1245 of 2003.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A Division Bench of the High Court Division after hearing the death reference along with the criminal appeals and jail appeal accepted the reference and dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants. However, the High Court Division allowed Criminal Appeal No. 1245 of 2003 and acquitted the co-convict Emran Hossain @ Rana. Hence, the appellants filed Jail Petition No.11-12 of 2012 before this Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Leave was granted to consider the following:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“I. whether the High Court Division failed to consider the vital aspect of the case in confirming the sentence of death awarded by the Tribunal to the petitioners that although P.Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 10 posing themselves to be the eye witnesses stated in their deposition that all the three condemned prisoners fired shots at the deceased from the firearms in their hands, the inquest report and the post mortem report show that the victim received two injuries only and thus, these lead to a controversy as to out of the three appellants whose shot struck the body of the victim; and<br/>II. Whether the above anomaly between the medical evidence and the testimony of the witnesses also creates doubt about the prosecution case and in the circumstances whether their sentence of death may be commuted to imprisonment for life.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Md. Helal Uddin Mollah, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that the alleged eye witnesses, namely P.Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 10 all deposed to the effect that the three accused appellants shot the victim with their firearms as a result of which the victim died. But only two bullets were recovered which belies the prosecution story that the three convict appellants shot and killed the victim. He further submitted that since the evidence of the eye witnesses is not fully consistent with the post mortem examination report and the evidence of the Doctor P.W. 14, doubt is created which is sufficient to commute the sentence of death to one of imprisonment for life and the High Court Division erred in law in not considering this aspect.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The State respondent did not file any concise statement. Mr. Biswajit Deb Nath, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the State with leave made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the appellants and the learned D.A.G. for the respondent and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that only two injuries having been found on the dead body of the victim, there is some doubt created inasmuch as one of the convict appellants did not shoot the victim with any firearm, or his shot, if fired at all, did not hit the victim. There is no doubt from the evidence and materials on record that the presence of the convict appellants at the place of occurrence was established. There is no way of assessment as to which one of the three convict appellants did not use his firearm against the victim. Hence, there is no illegality in the findings of the trial Court which has been upheld by the High Court Division, that the convict appellants are guilty on an offence under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code. However, the question of sentence based on the given facts and circumstances, has to be looked at carefully.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this regard we may profitably refer to the decision in the case of Hari Har Singh and others v the State of UP, 1975 4 SCC 148. In that case two of the accused had shot the victim and three others had struck with lathis. The medical evidence indicated that the victim died of the cumulative effect of the injuries. Out of four shots fired by the accused only two hit the victim. It was held that where the accused had not been convicted under section 302 simpliciter the death penalty ought not to have been imposed. On the medical evidence it could not be proved which of the two gunshot injuries was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the victim.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the facts of the case before us, where there is some inkling of a doubt as to which of the shots from the firearms of the accused caused the death, or conversely which one of the three accused who fired the shots missed his target, the application of sections 302/34 of the Penal Code was correct, but the question remains as to whether the death sentence would be appropriate. We are inclined towards the view that where the conviction is not under section 302 of the Penal Code simpliciter, and where the complicity of the accused is proved by the aid of section 34 of the Penal Code, then the sentence of death would not be appropriate.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the accused appellants were convicted and sentenced to death by an order of the trial Court dated 21.4.2003. The convict appellants have, therefore, suffered in the condemned cell for almost twelve years. In this connection we may refer to our earlier decision in the case of Manik versus The State judgment delivered on 19th January, 2015 (unreported) where the sentence of death was commuted to imprisonment for life considering, inter alia, the long period spent in the condemned cell.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the discussion above, we are of the opinion that ends of justice will be sufficiently met if the sentence of death is commuted to imprisonment for life.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the jail appeals, which challenged only the sentence of the convict appellants, are allowed and the sentence of death imposed upon the convict appellants Sohel Dewan @ Mehedi Hasan @ Chanchal, Billal Hossain and Md. Omar Faruq, is commuted to one of imprisonment for life.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div> <hr/><div id="ftn1"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong><u>Jail Appeal Nos. 2-3 OF 2012</u></strong></a><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 17th of May, 2006 passed by the High Court Division in Death Reference No. 41 of 2003 with Criminal Appeal Nos. 1181 and 1245 of 2003 and Jail Appeal No.295 of 2003.)</div></div></div></div>

After service of summons-notice upon the defendants therein the defendant-respondents appeared and filed a written statement denying all the material allegations made in the contents of the plaint among which there was a contention from the side of the defendants that the suit as has been filed is not maintainable. While the suit was ready for pre-emptory hearing the defendant-respondents again on 03.02.2010 filed an application under Order VII rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint on the ground that the plaint would be rejected under section 21A(b) of the Specific Relief Act. The learned trial Judge by his order dated 18.04.2010 rejected the plaint of Title Suit No. 15 of 2006 and thereby dismissing the suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned order of rejection of the plaint the plaintiff have preferred this appeal.</li><li style="text-align:justify">During hearing of this First Appeal Mr. Surojit Bhattacharjee, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the appellant while Mr. Uzzal Bhoumick, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the respondents.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that the learned trial Judge i.e. the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sunamganj during passing the impugned order committed illegality and during pre-emptory hearing stage of the original suit the defendant-respondents filed an application for rejection of the plaint along with dismissal of the original suit. The learned Advocate further submits that the learned Joint District Judge in rejecting the plaint failed to consider that the plaintiff has been in possession of the suit land on the basis of a contract dated 12.08.2004. The learned Advocate also submits that the learned court below misdirected himself in the question of law and facts. The relief sought for in the original plaint was not properly considered by the learned court below. The learned trial court ought to have found that the plaintiff  filed the suit for acquisition of  title by adverse possession from the father of the executant of <strong><em>bainapatra</em></strong> dated 24.07.2004 and lastly the learned Advocate submits, that the court below erroneously held that the suit  is not maintainable under section 21A(b) of the Specific Relief Act and the trial Judge without going through the contents of the plaint being failed to consider the materials on record on surmise and conjecture passed the impugned order which is liable to be set aside.</li><li style="text-align:justify">As against the aforesaid submissions of the learned Advocate of the appellant the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents opposing the grounds of the appeal-memo controverted the argument advanced from the side of the learned counsel of the appellant and submits that the learned trial Judge was quite justified and legal in passing the impugned order dated 18.04.2010 inasmuch as violating the provisions laid down in section 21A(b) of the Specific Relief Act (Act XVI of 1908) without depositing the balance amount of consideration of the contract the suit for specific of contract has been filed by the plaintiff. The learned Advocate further submits that from the very beginning of filing of the written statement it was alleged from the side of the defendants that the suit as instituted is not maintainable. During pendency of the suit the defendants to the original suit again filed an application under Order VII rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure and brought a definite cause for which the suit is liable to be dismissed as the plaint would be rejected under the provisions of law and the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sunamganj vide his order dated 18.04.2010 rightly held that the <em>bainapatra</em> which was submitted from the side of the plaintiff is shown to have executed on 12.08.2004 and in that <em>bainapatra</em> there is a recital that the consideration amount is Tk. 5,25,000/- (Taka Five lac and twenty five thousand). Out of that total amount of consideration money only Tk.4,00,000/- (Taka Four lac) was paid in favour of the executant and Tk.1,25,000/-(Taka One lac and twenty five thousand) was due. The learned Advocate lastly submits that it is apparent from the face of the record that the plaintiff to the suit at the time of filling of the original suit not deposited the balance consideration amount and as such the suit was not maintainable. The learned trial Judge rightly under the provision of law rejected the plaint and there is nothing to interfere with the impugned judgment and order.</li><li style="text-align:justify">I have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates and have gone through the relevant papers including the plaint itself and the impugned order of the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sunamganj dated 18.04.2010 and 21.04.2010 in Title Suit No.15 of 2006.</li><li style="text-align:justify">On perusal of the papers it transpires that the plaintiff-appellant instituted the original suit for specific performance of contract and  cancellation of a sub-kabala deed being No.1100 dated 24.05.2005 with confirmation of possession in the suit property appertaining to Mouza Syedpur corresponding to J.L. No.133 of settlement khatian No.1505 and 1669 and present khatian No. 4046 in plot No.4567. It is also apparent from the case records that in the suit for specific performance of contract the <em>bainanama</em> deed upon which the plaintiff banked upon was for consideration amount of Tk. 5,25,000/-(Taka Five lac and twenty five thousand) and it was contended by the plaintiff that out of the total consideration amount the defendant No.1 who was the executant of the deed accepted Tk.4,00,000/- (Taka Four lac) and executed the <em>bananama</em> but subsequently denying to take the balance consideration amount of Tk.1,25,000/-(Taka One lac and twenty five thousand) the defendant-respondents on 16.12.2005 refused to execute and register the kabala deed in favour of the plaintiff which is the cause of action of the original suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It further transpires from the case records that the defendants during pendency of the original suit on 03.02.2010 filed an application for rejection of the plaint under Order VII, rule 11(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure stating that the suit is barred by law as the plaintiff have failed to deposit the balance consideration amount of Taka Tk.1,25,000/-(Taka One lac and twenty five thousand) at the time of institution of the original suit.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned trial court hearing the application, by the impugned order dated 18.04.2010 rejected the plaint. In the impugned order it was held by the learned trial Judge that the suit is barred by the provisions laid down in section 21 A(b) of the Specific Relief Act which is the amended provisions of the relevant law. In this context; the provision of law as incorporated in section 21A(b) reads as follows,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “<em>notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force, no contract for sale of any immovable property can be specifically enforced unless-</em></div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify"><em>…………………………………………………</em></li><li style="text-align:justify"><em>The balance amount of consideration of the contract is deposited in the Court at the time of filing the suit for specific performance of the contract.”</em></li></ol><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The fact remains that this section 21A(b) was inserted by Act No. <em>XXVII of 2004</em>. In the pretext of this provision for depositing the balance consideration money is a condition-precedent as well as mandatory provision of law, failing which it would not be possible to enforce the contract by filing a suit for specific performance of contract. The provision of section 21A(b) specifically provides that the balance consideration money is required to be deposited at the time of filing of the suit and  there is no scope for the plaintiff to make deposit of the balance consideration money beyond the statutory period of limitation. Consequently; in absence of deposit of balance consideration money the suit is barred. The learned trial Judge was justified the holding the view that he has no other alternative but to held that the suit is not maintainable by law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In this context; their lordships in the case of <em>Osman Gani Mondal –vs.-Mainuddin Ahmed and others</em>, 27 DLR(AD)61 held that, where there is a cardinal rule of construction that the statutory restrictions are coached in negative terms they are almost invariably held to be mandatory. Our Apex Court with regard to the Constitution of Bangladesh 1972, 4<sup>th</sup> schedule, paragraph-7 opined the aforesaid view. Apart from this; in a case law reported in 64 DLR(AD)43 their lordships in the case of <em>JMS Glass Industries Ltd. –vs.- Customs, Excise and VAT Appellate Tribunal and others</em> held that, in the case of condition-precedent there is no scope of any option or discretion which can be applied to waive or dispense with the deposit of money within a period prescribed by law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Having regard to the facts, circumstances and discussions referred to above I am constrained to hold such a view that this appeal have got no substance to succeed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to costs. The impugned judgment and decree dated 18.04.2010 and 21.04.2010 respectively passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Sunamganj, in Title Suit No. 15 of 2006 is hereby upheld and confirmed.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         Let a copy of the judgment along with the Lower Court’s Record be sent down at once.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>First Appeal No. 222 of 2010 </strong></a></div></div></div></div>

He also submits that the appellate court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in not considering that the plaintiff-petitioner adduced six witnesses to prove the oral contract and delivery of possession but the defendants failed to prove their contention by adducing any credible oral or documentary evidence as such the judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He further submits that the appellate court below committed an illegality in not considering that the defendant nos.1 and 2 as DWs. 1 and 2 deposed that the plaintiff is still in possession of the suit land and they did not take any step for ejectment/ eviction of the plaintiff which amply proves transfer of the land in favour of the plaintiff through oral contract as such the judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. He next submits that the appellate court below committed illegality in not believing the PWs without assigning any reason as such the judgment and decree is liable to be set aside.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand Mr. Quamrul Haque Siddique, learned Advocate appearing for the opposite parties submits that the trial court passed the judgment and decree without thorough discussions of the evidence adduced by the parties and without considering that the whole case of the plaintiff based on oral contract, on the contrary appellate court below as a last court of fact after reassessing the evidence thoroughly and meticulously dismissed the suit with specific finding that the plaintiff failed to prove his case of oral contract as such there is nothing to interfere with the impugned judgment and decree. He also submits that since the finding of the appellate court below does not suffer from any legal infirmity nor are vitiated by any procedure affecting merit of the case as such impugned judgment and decree is not called for any interference in this revisional jurisdiction. He further submits that the plaintiff failed to prove his claim mentioning time, place and manner of entering into oral contract with the defendants and also payment of consideration amount with reliable evidence as such the appellate court below justly and legally passed the judgment and decree. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Md. Shah Jahan and others-Vs- Mir Hossain and others, reported in 17 BLD (AD) 219 and the case of Md.

Perused the revisional application, judgment and decree passed by the courts below alongwith lower court records and the decisions cited by the learned advocate for the opposite parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, plaintiff’s claim is based on oral contract. Since there is no documentary evidence relating to the agreement for sale it is very important to see whether the plaintiff could prove his claim including time, place and manner of entering into oral contract and also payment of consideration amount by adducing reliable evidence.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In support of his claim, plaintiff produced and examined six witnesses including himself.

ছিলামz</strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">From the above testimony of the PWs. it cannot be said that the plaintiff strictly proved time, place and manner of entering into the oral contract with the defendants inasmuch as plaintiff as PW.1 stated in his cross examination that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong>মখদ্দস আলম ও তুরুমিয়াকে আমি লেনদেনের দিন উপসিÛত রাখিয়া ছিলামz</strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">But PW.2 Turu Mia stated in his cross examination as mentioned above that he went to the house of the plaintiff to purchase an engine of the car and after entering in the house of the plaintiff he saw plaintiff, defendants, Mokadess Alam, Nuruzzaman or Tareque Mia and one mechanic.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">PW.3 Tareque alias Syed Joynal Abedin who was the lodging master of the plaintiff stated in his cross examination that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong>সঠিক কবে প্রথম কথাবার্তার তারিখ বলিতে পারব না কি¿º ঐদিন অনুমান ২/৩ জন লোক বাদী বিবাদীগণ ও আমি

from England in the year 1964 he purchased a house situated at Royhossain and started living therein. He also stated that he sold the house to his brother 2/3 years back before deposition. PW.1 deposed on 11.02.1980. So it can be presumed that he sold the house in the year 1977 or 1978. He also deposed that he stayed in his purchased house before leaving the county and he left for England in 1966 and came back in 1970 and started living in his purchased house. In the last part of 1970, defendants requested him to stay in their house as tenant and from December, 1970, he started living in the rented house owned by the defendants.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is hard to believe that a person while living in his own house will agree to live in a rented house at the request of land owners.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Relating to delivery of possession, plaintiff as PW.1 deposed that after returning from village in 1971 he paid taka 5,000/- to the defendant no.2 in presence of the defendant no.1 and after receiving the money defendant no.2 delivered possession in favour of the plaintiff. He deposed that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong>২০/১০/১৯৭১ ইং তারিখে আমি আরও ৫,০০০/০০ টাকা তাহাদিগকে দেইz এই পাঁচ হাজার টাকা দেওয়ার সময় আঃ খালিক ও তুরুমিয়া উপসিÛত ছিলেনz উক্ত টাকা গ্রহণ করত: নালিশা জায়গার দখল ১-২ বিবাদীগণ সমজাইয়া দেনz</strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">PW.2 Turu Mia stated in his cross examination that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong>ঐ দিন ঐ বৈঠকে প্রমানিত হয় যে, নালিশা ভুমির দখল বাদীকে পূর্বেই দেওয়া হইয়াছেz এমনকি পরের দিনও দখল বাদীকে দিতে পারেনz যখন দখল সমজানো হয় তখন আমি উপসিÛত ছিলামz তবে ইহা পরের দিন ১০/১১ টার সময় হইবেz</strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">PW.3 stated in his cross examination that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“</em></strong><strong>৫,০০০/- হাজার টাকা প্রদানের পরের দিন বা আগের দিন বিবাদীগণ নালিশী জায়গা বাদীকে সমঝাইয়া দেন, দখল দেওয়ার সময় আমি উপসিÛত ছিলামz</strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">PWs contradicted each other relating to delivery of possession.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Plaintiff as PW.1 deposed that he entered into an oral contract with the defendants on 05.02.1971 and on that day he issued a cheque of taka 10,000/- from his account of Habib Bank now Agrani Bank in favour of the defendant no.2 and he stated in his cross examination that the defendant no.2 drew the amount from bank.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">PW.4 Manger of the Agrani Bank stated in his deposition that the branch of the bank was burnt to ashes in the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of April, 1971, as such he is unable to produce any paper relating to the cheque or ecashment of cheque amount. Though the plaintiff claimed payment of money through cheque but he failed to produce any paper/document in support of his contention.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">PW.1 produced a letter claiming written by DW.1 which was marked as exhibit-‘1’. DW.1 categorically denied that he wrote any such letter. But plaintiff did not take any step to prove exhibit ‘1’ though he got ample time and opportunity.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">When the foundation of the suit for specific performance of contract is based on oral contract, the contract must be proved. if the contract is not proved than the suit fails. In the case of Md. Moslemuddin and others-Vs- Md. Jonab Ali and another, reported in 2 MLD (AD) 295, our apex court held:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“In a suit for specific performance of oral contract the plaintiff has to prove strictly his or her claim including time, place and manner of entering into the oral contract, payment of consideration with very reliable evidence and the court must scrutinize the oral agreement cautiously. Although oral agreement is not barred by any law such oral agreement is always taken with a grain of salt”.</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">I have perused the judgment and decree passed by the courts below. It appears that the trial court passed the judgment and decree in a slip shod manner without discussing the evidence adduced by the parties thoroughly. The appellate court below after reassessing the evidence on record pointed out contradictions of the testimony of PWs relating to time, manner and place of the oral agreement and also payment of consideration amount. The appellate court below reversed the judgment of the trial court and dismissed the suit on proper assessment of the evidence on record. Since the suit is concluded by finding of fact by the appellate court below as the final court of fact, impugned judgment and decree is not called for any interference in this revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code of Civil procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Under the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated above, I am of the view that the findings of the appellate court below does not suffer from any legal infirmity nor are vitiated by any procedure affecting merit of the case. I do not find any reason to interfere with the findings of the appellate court below.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the rule is discharged without any order as to cost.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Judgment and decree dated 26.10.1997 passed by the learned Additional District Judge and Anti Smuggling Tribunal, Sylhet, in Title Appeal No.211 of 1981 is hereby maintained.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Send down lower court records alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>
