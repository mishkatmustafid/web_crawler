During pendency of the appeal the defendants filed an application under Order XXXIX Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) praying for local inspection. After hearing the parties, the learned Additional District Judge by his order dated 08.05.2004, rejected the application.<br/><br/>Being aggrieved, the defendants filed Civil Revision No. 1794 of 2004 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule, which upon hearing the parties and considering the materials on record, was made absolute. Hence, the plaintiffs filed civil petition for leave to appeal No.1124 of 2005.<br/>Leave was granted on the following submissions of the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“(1) The ascertainment of possession is a judicial act which has to be ascertained by the Court upon evidence, and an Advocate Commissioner is not competent to ascertain possession and the High Court Division <em>suo moto</em> and without assigning any reason made the Rule absolute thereby allowed admission of additional evidence in a modified form though the appellate Court, after assigning reasons, rejected the application for local inspection being additional evidence in modified form and thus the High Court Division committed an error occasioning failure of justice in making the Rule absolute.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Syed Mahbubar Rahman, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the appellants made submissions in line with the grounds upon which leave was granted. The learned Advocate further submitted that the High Court Division failed to appreciate that possession cannot be ascertained by local investigation under order XXVI Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure which the High Court Division ultimately directed. He further submitted that the appellate Court rejected the application for local inspection after assigning cogent reasons, but the High Court Division, having accepted that an application under Order XXXIX Rule 7 was not tenable, seriously erred in observing that the appellate Court could have passed an order directing local investigation under Order XXVI Rule 9 of the Code.<br/><br/>Mr. Md. Nurul Islam Chowdhury, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 1 made submissions in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division.<br/><br/>We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates-on-Record appearing for the parties concerned, perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.<br/><br/>The provisions of Order XXXIX of the Code are intended to deal with property during the pendency of trial of a suit by way of granting temporary injunction and interlocutory orders. Rule 7 of Order XXXIX of the Code provides for, <em>inter alia, </em>inspection of any property which is the subject matter of such suit. It must be remembered that the purpose of such inspection is to see the physical condition of the property and to pass any interim order keeping in mind how the state or condition of the property may be affected by any interim change or by the passage of time while the suit is under trial. Suffice it to say that this provision does not apply to ascertainment of possession, which appears to be the purpose of the application. Hence, the Courts below as well as the High Court Division have rightly held that the application under Order XXXIX Rule 7 of the Code is not tenable.<br/><br/>The High Court Division has observed that the appellate Court could have passed an order directing local investigation under Order XXVI Rule 9 of the Code. This provision comes under the heading “Commissions for local investigations” and provides as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><em>“9. In any suit in which the Court deems a local investigation to be requisite or proper for the purpose of elucidating any matter in dispute, or of ascertaining the market-value of any property, or the amount or any mesne profits or damages or annual net profits, the Court may issue a commission to such person as it thinks fit directing him to make such investigation and to report thereon to the Court within such time not exceeding three months as may be fixed by the Court: </em></div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Provided that the Court may, on the prayer of the Commissioner and on sufficient cause being shown, extend the time.”  </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Essentially the purpose of local investigation under this provision is to ascertain the nature and feature and market value etc. of any property. Again, quite clearly this provision is not meant for ascertaining possession of property, which can only be done by taking evidence in the course of trial. <br/><br/>In view of the above discussions, we are of the opinion that the High Court Division was in error in making the Rule absolute. The appellate Court rightly rejected the application.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, without however, any order as to costs. The impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division is set aside.<br/><br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
