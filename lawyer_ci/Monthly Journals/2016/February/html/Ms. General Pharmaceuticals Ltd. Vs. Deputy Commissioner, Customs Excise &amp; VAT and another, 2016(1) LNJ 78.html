The Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner and Divisional Officer vide Nathi No. 4/Mushak/Medicine/Audit/ Demand/ 509/2005/ 5602 dated 4.12.2005 issued a demand notice under Section 55 of the Act upon the Petitioner demanding a deficit amount of VAT of Tk. 2,10,53,501/- for the period  from 29.9.2002 to 31.12.2004 as evident from an audit report dated 6.9.2005.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong>       On 13.12.2005 the Petitioner replied to the said Demand Notice dated 4.12.2005 citing inadvertence in adjusting the said deficit VAT amount of Tk. 2,10,53,501/- to its Current Account Register. It is noted that in rectifying that error the Petitioner made an adjustment of the said deficit amount in its Current Account within the time limit as specified in the demand notice dated 4.12.2005. That notwithstanding, on 22.12.2005 the Respondent No. 1 issued a notice upon the Petitioner fixing a date for hearing the matter. It is now contended that upon hearing the parties, but without considering the applicable law and the facts and circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner on 17.5.2006 illegally allowed the Irregular Case against the Petitioner penalizing it under Section 37(2) of the Act and directing a penalty payment of Tk. 2,10,53,501/-.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong>       Against the above factual backdrop, this Court is now invited to inquire to what extent it was legally within the authority and jurisdiction of the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner to impose the impugned penalty under Section 37(2) of the Act in the facts and circumstances. The preliminary question of law that needs to be determined, as submitted by the learned Advocate of the Petitioner Mr. Omar Sadat, is the extent of the distinct and mutually exclusive spheres of operations of Sections 55 and 37 of the Act in that the two provisions may not be simultaneously and concomitantly be drawn upon to initiate conjoined proceedings against any taxpayer   without, thereby, disregarding the legislative intent in that regard. The prayer is, accordingly, for any attempt at a conjunctive process of realization and penalization, as is reflected in the impugned order, to be declared as being illegal and without authority in law.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong>       It is evident to this Court that the very initiation of a demand process against the Petitioner Company on 4.12.2005 against the backdrop of alleged deliberate avoidance of payment of VAT is marked by a reliance jointly on the provisions of Sections 55 and 37 of the Act. This, the Petitioner submits, stems from an apparent erroneous understanding of the law. Primarily, the demand notice of 4.12.2005 issued under Section 55(1) of the Act reflects an effort at due realization of a shortfall of VAT totalling Tk. 2,10,53,501/-. In that regard, and in keeping with the specific provisions of Section 55(1) of the Act, it is noted that such demand for payment should be followed by an opportunity granted to the Petitioner to show cause against such demand within a specified period. Thereafter, and as indicated in the notice itself, a final determination under Section 55(3) shall follow on the issue of any shortfall in payment. However, that notice of 4.12.2005 refers additionally to Section 37(5) of the Act extending an opportunity to the Petitioner to show cause within a specified period why penalties, inclusive of a fine, shall not be imposed under Section 37 by reason of infractions of various specified provisions of the Act as well as the VAT Rules, 1991 (“the Rules”). It is this very notion of the mutual interplay and connectivity of Section 55 and 37 that is so apparent on the face of the notice of 4.12.2005 that the Petitioner submits is not sanctioned in law.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong>       The learned Advocate for the Petitioner Mr. Omar Sadat has referred to a series of Judgments of this Court that have underscored the functional distinction between the two Sections and, therefore, their spheres of operation. These decisions emphasize upon the fundamental objective of the Section 55 provisions being written into the law to ensure realization of shortfall in payment and those in Section 37 identifying specific offences and the sanctions that attach to the same.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong>       Highlighting the necessity of a strict interpretation and application of the provisions of the Act this Court, for example, in <em>PET Industries vs. Customs, Excise</em> reported in <em>61 DLR (2009) 734</em> emphasized the distinctive features of processes variously initiated under Sections 55 and 37 and insisted on the exhaustion of a process once initiated under Section 55 strictly in accordance with the prescriptions laid down in that Section. Acknowledging that the Act lays down elaborate procedures for the realization of tax under Section 55 on the one hand and for punishment for any violation or omission as enumerated in Section 37 on the other, this Court in the <em>PET Industries Case</em> held that the <em>“concerned authority is therefore, duty bound to follow the procedure as laid down in the Act for each and every action.” </em>In that regard, this Court discerns from the scheme of the Act that it would be for such authority to appreciate that there may not be a haphazard merger of these two provisions in proceeding against an assessee. This Court notes that in such a context the Section 55 provisions, in the facts and circumstances, are to be accorded primacy at realization of any amount having previously fallen due. The rationale for that conclusion is provided thus in the PET Industries Case at paragraphs 13 and 14, page 736:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>"If the entire provision of section 55 is considered then it would be clear that section 55 empowers the concerned VAT authority to take steps for realization of unpaid or less paid Vat or tax upon first issue of a notice asking to show cause and then, upon hearing, within 90 days to make a final demand in respect of any Vat or tax unpaid, evaded or less paid.</em><br/> <br/><em>On the other hand, section 37 of the said Act defines various offences and punishments for such offence. Before any final demand could be made under section 55(3), none of the provisions of section 37 could be resorted to. It is needless to say as the fiscal law demands strict interpretation so equally demands for strict application by an authority authorized to apply. The VAT Act is a comprehensive tax law. It has defined the tax to be paid as VAT on the specified sales and/or services. Similarly, it has laid down elaborate procedure for realization of the tax and punishment for any violation or omission. The concerned authority is therefore, duty bound to follow the procedure as laid down in the Act for each and every action. The Act does not empower any of the authorities created to become zealot to overpower and/or overawe any tax payer. Invoking and/or resorting to section 37 while issuing a notice under section 55(1) of the VAT Act therefore, could not be said to have been issued bona fide for the simple reason that at the time of issue of the notice, the authority concerned had not yet arrived at as to any evasion of VAT by the petitioner.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>Significantly, the interpretation above makes clear that invocation of a Section 55 process necessarily entails the act of final determination as contemplated under Section 55(3) on the basis of a reply or objection submitted further to a Section 55(1) notice. It is deemed prudent to reproduce herein below the provisions of Section 55(3) of the Act as was current at the material time:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“(৩) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন শুল্ক ও কর প্রদানের জন্য যেই ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে দাবী করা হয় সেই ব্যক্তি লিখিতভাবে উক্ত দাবীর বির্রদ্ধে আপত্তি উত্থাপন করিলে তাহাকে শুনানির সুযোগ দান করিতে হইবে। অতঃপর উক্ত ব্যক্তির উত্থাপিত অাপত্তি বিবেচনা করিয়া সংশ্লিষ্ট মূল্য সংযোজন কর কর্মকর্তা নোটিশে দাবীকৃত শুল্ক ও করের পরিমান প্রয়োজনবোধে পুনঃনির্ধারণ করিতে পারিবেন, এবং উক্ত ব্যক্তি নোটিশে দাবীকৃত বা ক্ষেত্রমতে পুনঃনির্ধারিত শুল্ক ও কর পরিশোধ করিতে বাধ্য থাকিবেন।” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>          Evidently, the centrality of a final determin-ation under Section 55(3), within the Section 55 realization process is, therefore, well-encapsulated in the decision in the <em>PET Industries Case.</em> Furthermore, their Lordships in that Judgment emphasized on the exhaustion of a Section 55 process in its entirety culminating in such a final determination even before any thought or intention may be entertained, if at all, by the VAT Authority to proceed under Section 37. To reiterate, Md. Abdur Rashid, J. succinctly held in the <em>PET Industries Case,</em> in the scheme of the Act <em>“(b)efore any final demand could be made under Section 55(3), none of the provisions of Section 37 could be resorted to.” </em>(at paragraph 14 page 736). It is found that their Lordships in that case emphasized significantly on the legal impossibility of any attempt at even raising the spectre of punishment under Section 37 of the Act even before any decision could be arrived at finally and conclusively under Section 55(3) as to the true extent of the shortfall in the payment of any tax or arrears in taxes. Should, however, the VAT Authority, at any instance, and indeed as occurred in the <em>PET Industries Case</em>, have strayed into a misreading of such comparative juxtaposition of Sections 55 and 37 and issued a notice referring simultaneously to both these provisions and seeking, thereby, to initiate parallel or indeed conjoint processes of determination under both the provisions, the unavoidable finding of this Court has to be that this is only but a device to bring undue pressure to bear upon a taxpayer by functionaries who have wrongly assumed ostensible authority to wield power not sanctioned in law. This rationale is found pervasive of the ratio decidendi  in a series of other decisions, most notably, <em>Abdul Motaleb vs. Customs</em> reported in <em>64 DLR(2012), 100</em> as well as in <em>Hotel Zakaria International (Pvt) Ltd. vs. National Board of Revenue (N.B.R.) &amp; Ors.</em> reported in <em>30 BLD (HCD)(2010), 388</em>.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong>       Furthermore, while most of the above referred decisions have declared on the illegality of notices issued  conjointly both under Section 55 and 37 of the Act, the judgment in the <em>Hotel Zakaria International  Case, </em>it is noted, goes further in carrying out a surgical exercise in such instances of conjoint notices, thereby, recognizing the validity of the process initiated under Section 55(1) and culminating in a final determination but categorically denying such part of the notice or process bearing reference to or initiated under Section 37 of the Act to be <em>“bereft or any legal consideration whatsoever.” </em>(at paragraph 6, page 389).<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong>       It is upon a consideration of the above and an application of the rationale of the judgments cited above that this Court finds the legal basis for the issuance of the notice itself of 4.12.2005 to be partially unsound to the extent that in addition to a Section 55 process of realization of short payment of VAT the notice concomitantly seeks to open up a process under Section 37 with a view to penalizing any violation of specified provisions of the Act. In that regard, this Court is of the view that the extent to which  said notice seeks to invoke provisions of Section 37, to that extent, it  indeed proceeds on a grave misunderstanding and erroneous application of the law insomuch as leading the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner to act resultantly beyond his statutory jurisdiction to so act. To that extent, therefore, the said notice is indeed shorn of any legal sanction and consequence. This preliminary finding of this Court has also to be further examined in light of developments that took place consequent upon the issuance of the notice of 4.12.2005. These are reflected in, as above noted, in the rectification by adjustment to its Current Account by the Petitioner of the deficit VAT amount of Tk. 2,10,53,501/- within the time limit as set in the demand notice of 4.12.2005. This was coupled, in lieu of an objection or cause shown to the Section 55(1) notice, by an explanation on the part of the Petitioner of the apparent unintentional slackness as contributed to such amount falling due and with the Petitioner, accordingly, tendering an unconditional apology in that regard. The Petitioner now submits that given these circumstances the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner erred in law by wholly ignoring the legal significance of such payment. That error contributed to the further misstep of seeking to draw a conclusion to the process initiated on 4.12.2005 through an Irregular Case and by arriving at specific findings of violation of various provisions of Section 37(2) of the Act. The outcome of that exercise has been an imposition of penalty equal to the sum of the shortfall in VAT payment initially demanded but otherwise already paid by the Petitioner as above. It is that exercise reflected in the Order of 17.5.2006, also incorporating the demand of payment of the penalty under Section 37(2), by the Respondent No. 1 that is the subject matter of this Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong>     This Court appreciates that there is indeed a paradox in initiating a process under Section 55 of charging and realization of payments fallen due and concurrently issuing a notice under Section 37 in terms as appear to prejudge the offences perceived to be reflected in such short payments. This Court notes that there is a self-contained process of charging and realization as found in Section 55 as a whole. Given the judicial pronouncements finding on the separateness of Section 55 and the Section 37 processes, Mr. Omar Sadat aptly interprets Section 55 as envisaging a process as initiated by a notice under Sub-section 1 invariably culminating in a final determination as stipulated in Sub-section 3. Furthermore, upon a careful reading of Section 55(4), in particular, as recognizes the ability of any payer to pay up as per any demand reflected in a Section 55(1) notice, the operation of Section 55(3) resulting in a final determination is not necessarily precluded given that Section 55(4) clearly presupposes the realization of penalty and fine. Notably, therefore, Section 55(4) at the time read thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৫৫(৪) উপধারা (১) এর অধীন শুল্ক ও কর প্রদানের জন্য যে ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে দাবি করা হয়, সেই ব্যক্তি লিখিতভাবে উক্ত দাবীকৃত অর্থ কিসি¹তে পরিশোধের ইচ্ছা ব্যক্ত করিলে কমিশনার তৎকর্তৃক নির্ধরিত শর্ত ও কিস্তিতে উক্ত দাবীকৃত অর্থের মধ্য হইতে অর্থদন্ড ও জরিমানার অর্থ পরিশোধের জন্য আদেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>          Predicated on the above, this Court, therefore, finds that if any case falls within the four corners of Section 55, a notice issued under Section 55(1) shall always culminate in a Section 55(3) final determination of the extent of liability. There is no scope in law to act in avoidance of such requirement, nor is there any scope in law to proceed halfway under Section 55 and, pending a final determination of liability there under, alter that course of action and invoke at will any other provision of the law, for example, Section 37 of the Act. This Court notes that notwithstanding the adjustment of the claimed shortfall amount by the Petitioner in December 2005 in the Current Account Register coupled within an explanation short of being read as an objection raised to the demand or a cause shown to the notice issued, it was incumbent upon the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner to follow up on that development and strictly proceed under Section 55(3) of the Act to make a final determination. It is apparent that in the present facts and circumstances that exercise, in all probability, upon a mistaken reading of the law, was overlooked and in preference, and by direct reference to the Section 37 process initiated on 4.12.2005, the Respondent No. 1 found himself somehow constrained to arrive at the impugned finding and direction under Section 37(2) imposing a penalty there under. Given the self-contained provisions of Section 55 as make it incumbent for any notice issued under Section 55(1) to invariably culminate in a final determination under Section 55(3), it is found accordingly that it was not within the authority of the Respondent No. 1 to give that process and exercise a complete go by and rely in the alternate on the provisions of Section 37(2). That finding in the facts and circumstances necessitates a further finding that the Petitioner’s rectification by adjustment in Current Account shall not necessarily preclude a final determination under Section 55(3). That final determination may very well invoke an additional imposition of penalties and fines as referred to in Section 55(4). Indeed furthermore as, Mr. Sadat has satisfactorily submitted, the exhaustion of the Section 55 process so in its entirety would still keep open the possibility thereafter under the Act, as was current on the material dates, for the authorities to independently construct a case under Section 37 and pursue that matter upon issuing a notice and extending an opportunity to be heard under Section 37(5).<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong>     It is noted that no Affidavit-in-Opposition has been filed in this case. The learned Assistant Attorney General Ms. Kashefa Hussain has submitted that the impugned determination by the Deputy Commissioner is an order that is appealable under Section 42(1)(L) before the Commissioner  (Appeal). By that reason, therefore, it was incumbent upon the Petitioner   to so appeal rather than invoking the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court. Whenever an issue as to the maintainability of a Writ Petition is so taken against the context of availability of alternate forums, this Court has to consider the same in application of the fundamental principle that the notion of exhaustion of alternate remedy does not reflect an absolute principle or rule of jurisdiction but is merely one that this Court may rely upon to regulate or manage its jurisdiction. That rationale has informed various Judgments of this Court enunciating various grounds to relax the perceived inflexibility of the requirement of initial resort to alternate remedies (<em>Dhaka Warehouse Ltd. &amp; another vs. Assistant Collector of Customs &amp; others</em> reported in <em>(1991)11BLD(AD)327 </em>as well as <em>Nagin</em><em>a</em><em> Silk Mill vs. Income Tax Officer</em> reported in <em>15DLR(SC)(1963)181)</em>. The learned A.A.G. for her part has relied upon the Judgment in <em>Bengal Glass Works Ltd. vs. Member VAT NBR &amp;others </em>reported in <em>9MLR (HC)2004,273</em> as held that since the legislature in the general scheme  of the Act did not differentiate between executive and adjudicatory orders, appeal lies against all such orders as provided under Section 42 of the Act, thereby, negating access to Writ jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution.  Against this backdrop, this Court seized of this Writ in Certiorari, however, finds relatively greater significance in Mr. Sadat’s submission that this Writ arises against the backdrop of an assumption of authority by the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner stemming from an erroneous reading of the law. Given that the relief in Certiorari is available in circumstances where the statutory duty has been to act judicially, whether in an administrative or in a quasi-judicial capacity and in the sense of acting duly and reasonably, this Court holds that this Court shall readily intervene in circumstances where there has been a blatant disregard of that duty so to act, thereby, prejudicially affecting the interests of a petitioner. By that reason, it is this Court’s finding that proceeding on an error of law the Respondent No. 1, Deputy Commissioner far exceeded his authority than as contemplated in the Act itself and in doing so acted in a manner illegal, unreasonable and arbitrary from which no consequence in the manner specified in the Impugned Order can legally follow. The said Order of 17.5.2006 is indeed in this Court’s view one without any legal effect by reason of having been passed without any lawful authority. That finding is in turn predicated on questions of interpretation of law as above rightfully clothe this Court with the jurisdiction in Certiorari and to  entertain the Petitioner’s prayer under this Application. That is indeed the rationale behind this Court’s observation below in the <em>PET Industries Case:</em><br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“There is no dearth of authority to say when an authority is created to exercise certain authority and a procedure laid down to follow in the exercise of such authority by a statue, the authority concerned shall exercise the authority in accordance with the procedure otherwise its action shall become unauthorized. Any demand therefore made by an authority concerned for VAT or other tax, which was not made in accordance with the procedure laid down in the VAT Act, such demand must be held to be not a demand in the eye of law and this Division cannot deny or refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution to strike down such unauthorized exercise of statutory power.”</em>(at paragraph 15, page 736)              </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong>     In view of the above, this Court finds that the exercise undertaken by the Respondent No. 1 resulting in the Impugned Order of 17.5.2006 cannot be said to stem from a lawful exercise of statutory power. By that reason the Impugned Order of 17.5.2006 as imposes a penalty under Section 37(2) of the Act is declared to have been made without lawful authority and to be of no legal effect. This finding shall not in any way, however, restrain the concerned Respondents to take further action, if any, against the Petitioner but only upon a strict adherence to the relevant provisions of the Act, as in particular found in Section 55 of the Act. This shall be done with the primary aim of bringing to a final conclusion the process initiated against the Petitioner by the Section 55(1) notice dated 4.12.2005.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong>     Accordingly, given the Petitioner’s preponderatingly satisfactory invocation of and reliance on the applicable law, this Court finds overall merit in the Application and is inclined to treat the Rule as this being made absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong>     In the result, the Rule is made absolute subject, however, to the observations and specific findings on law as above.<br/> <br/>         There is no Order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>         Ed.</strong></div></div></div>
