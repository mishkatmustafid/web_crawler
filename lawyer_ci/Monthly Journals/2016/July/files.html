To our mind, this description makes the land in possession of the plaintiffs sufficiently identifiable. It appears that the finding of the trial Court with regard to the plaintiffs’ claim of exclusive possession is not correct in view of Exhibit-2 series and also the fact that D.W. 1 admitted the possession in the suit land by the plaintiffs, the High Court Division was wrong in upholding the decision of the trial Court.</strong> <strong>Moreover, admittedly a separate khatian has been prepared in the name of the plaintiffs, which is sufficient to show exclusive possession of the plaintiffs.. . .

The facts of the case, in brief, are that   the appellant along with others as plaintiffs instituted title suit No. 246 of 2001 in the court of Senior Assistant Judge, 2<sup>nd</sup> Court, Narayangonj, praying for permanent injunction in the suit land. They contended, inter<em> alia,</em> that the suit land belonged to Azimuddin Madbar who died leaving behind two sons, named Hafizuddin and Mofizuddin. Hafizuddin died leaving behind his wife Nurjahan Bibi, a son plaintiff No. 1 and two daughters plaintiff Nos. 2 and 3. Nurjahan Bibi transferred her share of the land along with tin shed huts by Wasiwatnama dated 14.3.1981 in favour of the plaintiff No. 1. During R.S. operation 23 decimals of land was recorded in the name of Nurjahan Bibi. In this way the plaintiffs have been in possession in the suit land by way of inheritance and on the strength of the Wasiwatnama. Their names have been correctly recorded in S.A. and R.S.  Khatian. Thus the defendants have got no right, title and possession in the suit land. On 24.11.2001 the defendants threatened to dispossess the plaintiffs from the suit land. Hence, they filed the suit.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The defendant Nos. 1-4 contested the suit by filing written statement denying the material statements made in the plaint contending, <em>inter alia</em>, that the suit land belonged to Azimuddin who died leaving behind two sons Hafizuddin and Mofizuddin.  Hafizuddin and Mofizuddin both transferred 45 decimals of land from plot No. 1814 by a kabala dated 12.4.1943 in favour of Satish Chandra Paul and handed over possession.  They further sold 45 decimals of land by a kabala dated 17.4.1944 in favour of Hossain Miah and Alijan Miah, who got possession and their names were recorded duly in the Khatian. Hossain Miah and Alijan Miah transferred 22decimals of land by a kabala dated 4.2.1957 in favour of Mir Syed Ali. Hossain Miah again  transferred 11decimals of land by a kabala dated 29.4.1963 in favour of Mir Syed Ali, Alijan  transferred 11ecimals of land by two kabalas dated 17.3.1965 and 01.5.1965 in favour of Mir Syed Ali. In this way Mir Syed Ali purchased 45 decimals of land and his name was correctly recorded in the R.S. Khatian. One Chan Miah being an heir of Hossain Miah transferred 5 decimals of land by a kabala dated 14.9.1970 in favour of Mofizuddin, Mir Ibrahim son of Mir Syed Ali sold 7 decimals of land by a kabala dated 3.5.2000 and Mir Wahidulla and other two heirs of Mir Syed Ali transferred 7 decimals of land by a kabala dated 29.11.1993 in favour of defendant No.1.  Mir Shahjahan Ali, another son of Mir Syed Ali, transferred 7decimals of land and Mir Salima Begum and Shahida Begum two daughters of Mir Sayed Ali transferred 7decimals of land in favour of defendant No.1. Mosammat Masuda, another daughter of Mir Syed Ali, transferred by a kabala dated 4.3.1990 an area of .0367 Ajutangsha in favour of the defendant. Mofizuddin, the father of defendant No.1 transferred 5 decimals of land by a Heba dated 29.11.1996 in favour of defendant No.1. In this way defendant No. 1 became owner and possessor of 68 decimals of land and mutated his name, constructed a tin shed hut, one kitchen and one temporary latrine and has been in possession thereof through his tenant. Defendant No. 1 sold 5 decimals of land to Abdul Karim who constructed a pucca building and has been in possession. The plaintiffs have got no title and possession in the suit land. With these averments they prayed for dismissal of the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiffs examined 3 P.Ws. and the defendants examined 4 D.Ws.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After hearing the parties and considering the evidence and materials on record, the learned Assistant Judge, Second Court, Narayangonj, by his judgment and decree dated 18.08.2003 dismissed the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree, the plaintiffs preferred Title Appeal No. 188 of 2003 and the said appeal was heard by the learned Additional District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Narayangonj, who by his judgement and decree dated 13.5.2004 allowed the appeal and decreed the suit setting aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Against the aforesaid judgement and decree, the defendants filed Civil Revision No. 2151 of 2004 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule, which upon hearing was made absolute. Hence, the plaintiffs as petitioners filed civil petition for leave to appeal No. 353 of 2006.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Leave was granted on the following submissions of the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“(I) It is abundantly clear that the suit land has been properly described by the plaintiff in the plaint showing the boundary of it and out of 92 decimals of land 46 decimals has been in the possession of the plaintiffs and on the Northern side of the suit land it was the land of Mir Syed Ali, on the Southern side it was road and on  the Eastern side it was the land of Nazimuddin and on the Western side it was the land of Mir Syed Ali, and this clearly shows that the suit land has been properly specified by the plaintiffs in the plaint, but the High Court Division without taking into consideration the specification of the suit land made the Rule absolute  which is illegal, untenable and unsustainable in the eye of law.<br/>“(II) The High Court Division failed to consider that D. W. 1 during cross examination had stated that:<br/><strong>ÔÔ </strong><strong>আমি এস, এ, পর্চা দাখিল করিয়াছি। তাহাতে বাদীদের পূর্ববর্তীদের নামলিপি আছে</strong><strong>|ÕÕ</strong> and also  stated that <strong>‘‘বাদীর জজ্জল অবদি নালিশী ভূমিতে বাড়ি ঘর করিয়া  বসবাস করিতেছে। আমার অনুমতি দানের পূর্বেও বাদীরা এখানে থাকিত</strong><strong>|ÕÕ</strong> This  clearly shows that the plaintiffs have been in possession of the suit land and the High Court Division has traveled beyond its jurisdiction by not considering that the suit land for which the plaintiffs prayed for injunction has been in the possession of the plaintiffs and as such the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside; and <br/>“(III) D. W.1 during cross examination stated that <strong>ÔÔ </strong><strong>বাদীদের দুইটি সেমি পাকা বারান্দাসহ ঘর আছে। একটি দোচালা  ঘর আছে, তাহারা জন্ম অবদি এইখানে ভোগ দখল আছে। বাদীদের ঘর আমার বাড়ি ঘর হইতে লাগোয়া</strong><strong>|ÕÕ   </strong>The possession of the suit land by the plaintiffs is also corroborated by D.W.1 and on this score the High Court Division ought to have taken into consideration that the suit land for which the plaintiffs prayed for injunction is specified  and also the plaintiffs are in possession of the suit land and  as such the judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be set aside since the impugned judgment and order is not sustainable in law and as such is liable to be set aside.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Sheikh Mohammad Morshed, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant made submissions in line with the grounds upon which leave was granted. The learned Advocate further submitted that the trial Court noted that Exhibit-2 and 2(Kha) show 46 decimals of land having separate mutation in the name of the plaintiff but went on to hold that the boundary of the suit land was not proved by any witness and that although the suit land was recorded in a separate khatian as shown in the R.S. <em>Porcha</em> it did not record the separate plots of the plaintiff and defendant. The learned Advocate submitted that Exhibit-2 series clearly shows that separate plot have been mentioned in the khatian.  In this regard he referred to the decision in the case of <strong><em>Moharram Ali &amp; another Vs. Mohammad Madhu Mia &amp; ors.</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>41 DLR (AD)92. </em></strong>The learned Advocate pointed out that D.W. 1 admitted in his cross-examination that the plaintiffs were in possession of the suit land and living there since their birth by constructing homestead thereon. He also pointed out that D.W.1 admitted that the name of the predecessor of the plaintiffs appears in the S.A. <em>Porcha</em> and a separate R.S. Khatian has been prepared in respect of the suit plot owned by the heirs of Hafiz Uddin, thus the appellate Court was correct in decreeing the suit for permanent injunction, and the High Court Division was wrong to interfere with the decision of the last Court of facts.     </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Awlad Ali, learned Senior Advocate   appearing on behalf of the respondent Nos. 1-5 made submission in support of the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division. The learned Advocate further submitted that admittedly the plaintiffs are co-sharers of the suit plot comprising land measuring 92 decimals with homestead and, therefore, cannot maintain a suit for permanent injunction unless they can prove their exclusive possession. The learned Advocate also submitted that the 46 decimals of land claimed by the plaintiffs having not been specifically demarcated, the suit for permanent injunction was not maintainable and the High Court Division was correct in setting aside the decree of the lower appellate Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocates appearing for the parties concerned and perused the impugned judgment and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We note from the impugned judgement that the High Court Division reversed the judgement and decree of the appellate Court on the ground that the suit land was not identifiable, and as the suit for permanent injunction related to a portion of a bigger plot such a suit is not maintainable unless the plaintiffs are able to make out a case of exclusive possession. The High Court Division observed that the plaintiffs ought to have filed a suit for partition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate for the appellant has placed before us the case of Moharram Ali and another Vs. Mohammad Modhu Mia and others reported in 41 DLR (AD) 92, where it was held that where a co-sharer in ejmali property, when he has been in exclusive possession of a specific and separate share thereof demarcated by boundary, is entitled to retain his portion till legal partition, by an order of injunction.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, we find that the trial Court dismissed the suit because the boundaries of the suit land were not proved by evidence. We note, however, that the trial Court observed that although the suit land was recorded in a separate khatian but the plots were not separated in the names of the plaintiffs and defendants. However, this observation of the trial Court is contradictory to Exhibit-2 series, which show two separate plots. Incidentally the learned Judge of the trial Court himself noted that the mutation <em>porcha</em> exhibited by the plaintiffs as Exhibit-2 and 2(Kha) show that the name of the plaintiffs have been mutated in respect of 46 decimals of land. Moreover, by amendment dated 20.2.2003 the suit land has been described as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>       ""৩৬৮৪ দাগে ১৬ আনা ৯২ শতাংশের পশ্চিমাংশের কাতে ৪৬ শতাংশz যাহার চৌহদ্দি উত্তরে ~~সয়দ আলীz দক্ষিণে রাস¹া, পূর্বে- নাজিম উদ্দিন, পশ্চিমে- ~~সয়দ আলী তৎপশ্চিমে রেল লাহ~নz''           </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">This description, in our view, is sufficiently clear to identify the suit land of the plaintiffs as being 46 decimals of land out of 92 decimals of the whole plot i.e. half of the plot, situated in the western side of the plot bounded in the north by Syed Ali, in the south by a road, in the east by Nazim Uddin and in the west by Syed Ali. To our mind, this description makes the land in possession of the plaintiffs sufficiently identifiable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above discussion, it appears that the finding of the trial Court with regard to the plaintiffs’ claim of exclusive possession is not correct in view of Exhibit-2 series and also the fact that D.W. 1 admitted the possession in the suit land by the plaintiffs, the High Court Division was wrong in upholding the decision of the trial Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, admittedly a separate khatian has been prepared in the name of the plaintiffs, which is sufficient to show exclusive possession of the plaintiffs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, our views expressed above shall not be binding in the trial Court if any suit is filed for partition. In such event the trial Court will be at liberty to give saham to the parties in accordance with title and possession established in such partition suit.    </li><li style="text-align: justify;">With the above observations, the appeal is allowed without, however, any order as to costs.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

(8)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 (VII of 1981)</strong><br/><strong>Section 7A</strong><br/><strong>It has been provided in Section 7A that when an application against the dismissal or removal from service is pending before the Administrative Tribunal, if the employee or servant of the republic dies, than his/her heirs can be substituted in the pending proceeding as heirs of the deceased and right to so survive. But here there was no case pending against any dismissal or removal before the administrative tribunal when the employee died of cancer. Therefore, no question of substitution can be raised for the heirs 'of the deceased. Only the servant of the republic may apply before the Administrative Tribunal or his heirs may be substituted in the case if he dies during pendency of the case filed by him against his removal or dismissal from service. But there is no such case pending in the Administrative Tribunal at the time of his death.

(9 and 10)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 102</strong><br/><strong>The penalty imposed by the authority concerned upon the dead man is not legal in the eye of law.

The Predecessor of the petitioners while in service was posted at Sub Post Office, Khalifarhat, Noakhali and delivered his service at the address mentioned above from 10.04.1994 and 23.07.1996. During that time, a departmental proceeding was initiated against him upon false and baseless allegation and subsequently he was suspended from the post temporarily. Besides, a criminal case was also started against him upon the same self allegation and the appointing authority served a notice upon the predecessor of the petitioners who replied in writingin time to the same explaining the reasons thereof.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It has been further stated in the petition' that during pendency of the criminal, proceeding, departmental proceeding was suspended. In the criminal proceeding the predecessor of the petitioners was acquitted after holding trial of the case by the competent court. Against the order of acquittal the concerned authority preferred an appeal being Govt. Appeal No. 23 of 2003 before this Court. During pendency of the said government appeal the predecessor of the petitioners died of fatal disease on 13.01.2007 and subsequently the criminal appeal was abated at the instance of the authority concerned under Section 431 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is further stated that the concerned authority in respect of the family pension and other service benefit of the predecessor of the petitioners, sought a legal opinion from the learned government pleader through a latter vide Memo No. 317dated 23.07.2007. The G P gave his opinion in favour of the petitioners. Thereafter, the respondent No.4 issued a letter vide Memo' No. <strong>Gd-1-1/96-97</strong> dated 02.08.2007 in the caption of ’’<strong>দন্ডাদেশ নামা</strong>’’ withdrawing the departmental proceeding against the predecessor of the petitioners but most arbitrarily granted leave as to be paid for his suspension period as penalty (Annexure-E to this writ petition). In the meantime, the predecessor of the petitioners, had got 57 years age. As a result, he would have been placed on LPR (leave preparatory to retirement) but the authority through letter vide <strong>bw_ bs we-1-1/Kg©Pvix /Aemi/2006</strong> dated 24.09.2006 informing that no order as required to be issued for sending him on LPR. Thereafter, the respondent No. 4 through letter vide <strong>bw_ bs we-1-1/Kg©Pvix/Aemi/ 2006</strong> dated 19.08.2007 sanctioned family pension without granting LPR. The petitioner No. 1 being wife of the deceased preferred an appeal against the said letters dated 02.08.2007, 24.09.2006 and 19.08.2007 respectively before the respondent No. 3 stating reasons thereof and further seeking for full pay with allowances and other service benefits treating the suspension period of the predecessor as usual duty and granting LPR in due course. But the appellate authority dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Respondent No.4 through <strong>নথি নং- কর্ম-বি/ এন-০২ /০৮</strong> dated 11.05.2008 on misconception of law and non-consideration of the merit of the appeal. Thereafter, the Wife (petitioner No.1) of the predecessor made a representation before the Respondent No. 2 seeking remedy in respect of the same but the respondent informed her by issuing a letter vide <strong>নথী নং তদমত্ম ৬-২/৯৬/১৬৮১</strong> dated 15.10.2008 under signature of Respondent No.5 that they had no jurisdiction to consider the prayer filed by her and -further issued a letter by the Respondent No. 4 clarifying the leave to be granted for the suspension period of the deceased employee through Memo No. <strong>নথী নং বি-৩০৬</strong> dated 22.02.2009 wherein it has been stated that from 14.08.1996 to 22.04.1998 the deceased employee was granted leave with full pay and 23.04.1998 to 09.06.2000, was granted leave with half pay and from 02.06.2000 to 30.09.2006 long six years three months granted leave without pay, which appears to be penalty upon him though the departmental proceeding was withdrawn by the authority. Thus, the heirs of the predecessor-employee, being petitioners moved this court with a petition and obtained the present rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Aminul Islam, learned Advocate on behalf of the petitioners submits that the impugned orders (Annexures -H, E, F and Fl to this writ petition) passed by the appellate authority and the appointing authority are arbitrary and malafide and not tenable in the eye of law. He submits that the allegation brought by the concerned authority against the predecessor of the petitioners was vague and baseless. In fact, no offence or misconduct of deception was committed by the predecessor of the petitioners and the amount of cash shortage was duly deposited in the office of the Respondent No.4 as the same was kept in his personal custody of being insecured inside the post office. He submits further that the predecessor of the petitioners got order of acquittal from the charge brought against him. Against which the government preferred an appeal in which he had been abated after his death. He submits further that the departmental proceeding was also withdrawn by the concerned authority and subsequently, the concerned authority obtained the opinion as desired from the learned government pleader in respect of the service benefit of the petitioners wherein the learned pleader opined that the petitioners are entitled to get all benefits of the predecessor as per asusual course. He further submits that as per provision of Rule 247, 1<sup>st</sup> Part, Bangladesh Service Rules, if Departmental Proceeding is withdrawn after death of the person concerned, no penalty can be imposed upon a dead man who served as an employee in the republic. He filially submits that the heirs of the late employee have been passing the days with financial hardship on being deprived by the impugned orders preventing them from getting full payment of benefits and other allowances of the predecessor and the petitioners, finding no other alternative and efficacious remedy, moved this court and obtained .present the rule which should be made absolute.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Mr. Bishwjit Roy, the learned Deputy Attorney General appearing on behalf of the Respondents submits that the petitioners are not government employees and they are not in any way aggrieved persons" for which they can file a writ petition before this Court invoking Article 102 of the Constitution. He further submits that the petitioners as heirs of the late employee filed application before the appellate authority which was turned down narrating all the reasons' therein. He lastly submits that the petitioners could file an application before the Administrative Tribunal if they were somehow aggrieved by the impugned letters. In fact, they did not have any right to file a writ petition before this Court. Accordingly, this rule should be discharged.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Heard the learned Advocates .from both the parties and perused the petition along with annexures thereof, wherefrom it transpires that the predecessor of the petitioners- during his service 1t1 the republic at Khalifarhat, Noakhali upon an allegation of shortage of fund in the sub-post office, a departmental proceeding was initiated against him and on the same self allegation a criminal case was also started against him. During pendency of the criminal proceeding, the departmental proceeding was suspended but in trial of the criminal case he got an order of acquittal from charge brought against him when he was found not guilty of the offence by the competent court of law. Subsequently a government appeal was preferred by the authority concerned. During pendency of the Govt. appeal, the predecessor of the petitioners died of cancer and therefore, the departmental proceeding was also withdrawn by the concerned authority. But the authority treating the predecessor of the petitioners unusual servant of the republic, curtailed some service benefits which the petitioners are entitled to get asusual course of his service. It appears from the submission of the learned Deputy Attorney General that the petitioners have not been aggrieved by the impugned letters as they are not servants in the service of the republic. Therefore, they don't have locus standi to file this writ petition before the court under Article 102 of the constitution. In view of the facts, as above, let us see Sections 4 and section 7A of the Administrative Tribunal Act, 1980 which provides as under</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>4. (1) An Administrative Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine applications made by any person in the service of the Republic l[or of any statutory public, authority] in respect of the terms and conditions of his service including pension rights, or in respect of any action taken in relation to him as a person in the service of the Republic 2[or of any statutory public authority].</em></strong><br/><strong><em>(2) A person in the service of the Republic 3[or of any statutory public authority] may make an application to an Administrative Tribunal under sub-section (1), if he is aggrieved by any order or decision in respect of the terms and conditions of his service including pension rights or by any action taken in relation to him as a person in the service of the Republic 4[or of any statutory public authority]:</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Provided that no application in respect of an order, decision or action which can be set aside, varied or modified by a higher administrative authority under any law for the time being in force relating to the terms and conditions of the service of the Republic l[or of any statutory public authority] or the discipline of that service can be made to the Administrative Tribunal until such higher authority has taken a decision on the matter</em></strong><br/><strong><em>2[Provided further that, where no decision on an appeal or application for review I in respect of an order, decision or action referred to in the preceding proviso has been taken by the higher administrative authority within a period of two months from the date on which the appeal or application was preferred or made, it shall, on the expiry of such period, be deemed, for the purpose of making an application to the Administrative Tribunals under this section, that such higher authority has disallowed the appeal of the application.] </em></strong><br/><strong><em>Provided further that no such application shall be entertained by the Administrative Tribunal unless it is made within six months from the date of making or taking of the order, decision or action concerned or making of the decision on the matter by the higher administrative authority, as the case may be. </em></strong><br/><strong><em>(3) In this section "person in the service of the Republic 3[or of any statutory public authority]" includes a person who is or has retired or is dismissed, removed or discharged from such service, but does not include a person in the defence services of Bangladesh 4[or of the Bangladesh Rifles] </em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the provision of Section. 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act that a servant if being aggrieved by any order of the concerned authority, shall have to go to the Administrative Tribunal for his remedy first, but the present petitioners have no that scope to file any application before the Administrative Tribunal as they were not in the service of the republic. Section 7A says:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>2[7A. (1) Where a person is dismissed or removed from service and an application is made under section 4 against such removal or dismissal and that person dies during the pendency of the case, the right to sue of that applicant shall survive if his service had been pensionable under any law for the time being in force.</em></strong><br/><strong><em>(2) Where the right to sue survives under sub-section (1), such legal representative of the deceased applicant who would have been entitled to the pensionery benefit at the event of the death or retirement of the deceased applicant may be substituted, upon an application, made to the Tribunal or, as the case may be, to the Appellate Division, within sixty days from the date of the death of the applicant.</em></strong><br/><strong><em>(3) The legal representative of the deceased, as referred to in sub-section (2), shall be entitled to the pensionery benefit which would have been payable to that deceased if he had been removed or dismissed:</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Provided that, such pensionery benefit shall not be payable unless the Tribunal or, as the case may be, the Appellate Division, declares the order of the dismissal or removal, as the case may be, as illegal or void:</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Provided further that, for the purpose of this section, the applicant shall be deemed to have died or retired, as the case may be, on the day on which he was removed or dismissed. </em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It has been provided in Section 7 A that when an application against the dismissal or removal from service is pending before the Administrative Tribunal, if the employee or servant of the republic dies, than his/her heirs can be substituted in the pending proceeding as heirs of the deceased and right to so survive. But here there was no case pending against any dismissal or removal before the administrative tribunal when the employee died of cancer. Therefore, no question of substitution can be raised for the heirs 'of the deceased</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On plain reading of these sections it appears that on1y the servant of the republic may apply before the Administrative Tribunal or his heirs may be substituted in the case if he dies during pendency of the case filed by him against his removal or dismissal from service. But there is no such case pending in the Administrative Tribunal at the time of his death. In such view of the fact, the petitioners do not have locus standi to file an application before the administrative tribunal as they are not servants in the republic.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In such a situation, the petitioners as heirs of the predecessor, have no other forum to seek relief rather to move this court with a writ petition invoking Article 102 of the constitution. It is pertinent here to refer the case of Kazi Shamsunnahar and others -Vs- Commandant RRF Khulna and others, reported in 2 BLC 569 where their Lordships observed that</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>"Admittedly, the deceased government servant was not removed from service prior to his death but he was removed from service just after his death resulting thereby the government servant died while he was stiff in the service of the Republic for which the petitioners as heirs of the government servant are entitled to recover the service benefits as permissible under the law and the writ petition is maintainable. "</em></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case there is no dispute that Abdur Rouf Chowdhury was neither convicted nor removed, nor dismissed from service before his death. So the penalty imposed by the authority concerned upon the dead man is not legal in the eye of law. It is apparent that the petitioners are admittedly heirs of the deceased-employee, having no other forum except to invoke writ jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution and since the predecessor of the petitioners was acquitted from the charge brought against him by the competent court of law, there is no bar to the petitioners as heirs of the ex-employee in obtaining full service benefits as per service rules. Furthermore, as the departmental proceeding was withdrawn by the concerned authority the service of the predecessor of the petitioners was seemed to be treated as regular one and all service benefits of the predecessor to be recovered by the petitioners as his heirs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the discussion as above, we are inclined to hold that the impugned orders (Annexures- H, E, F and F1 to this writ petition) are ex-facie illegal and the same have been passed without any lawful authority, and are of no legal effect, therefore, the petitioners as heirs' of late Abdur Rob Chowdhury are entitled to get all service benefits including pension and arrear, if any, as permissible in law.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the result the rule is made absolute without order as to costs. The impugned orders (Annexures H, E, F and F1 to this writ petition) have been passed without lawful authority and are of no legal effect. The respondents are directed to pay full service benefits of late Abdur Rob Chowdhury to the petitioners as permissible under the law.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

In fact, all the players admitted that they have taken money in advance from the Petitioner-Club for the season 2015-2016. Some players allege that they were compelled to take money in advance from the Petitioner-Club under coercion. But they did not even lodge any G.D Entry against the Petitioner-Club. Even they did not intimate the matter to the BFF soon after the alleged occurrence took place. The Petitioner-Club has intimated to the BFF by   its letters dated 24.1.2016, 25.1.2016, 26.1.2016, 02.2.2016 and 19.3.2016 and requested to the BFF to intervene and exercise its good office so that respondent Nos. 4-11 cannot enter into contract with any other club/clubs for the session 2015-2016. The BFF, however, did not sit with it and it has rightly forwarded the matter to the Players’ Status Committee after receipt of the letter dated 19.3.2016 from the Petitioner-Club. The Petitioner-Club specifically alleges that respondents Nos. 4-11 accepted the money in advance from the Petitioner-Club, in January 2016, for the season 2015-2016, while they entered into a contract with Sheikh Russel Kriachakro and Abahani Limited Chittagong in March 2016, long after they accepted money in advance from the Petitioner-Club. This dispute is required to be resolved by the Players’ Status Committee. The BFF by its letter dated 19.3.2016 informed the Petitioner-Club that as soon as the decision is taken by the Players’ Status Committee, the BFF shall inform the decision to the Petitioner-Club. We have already held that the Players’ Status Committee is competent to resolve the disputes among the Petitioner-Club, respondent No. 3, and respondent Nos. 4-11. We direct the Players’ Status Committee to resolve the matter in dispute among the Petitioner-Club, the respondent Nos. 4-11 and the BFF within 2(two) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.        . . .(44, 49 and 52)</strong><br/><br/><strong><em>Shahabuddin (Md) Vs.

As per Article 5(2) of the ‘Statutes of the Bangladesh Football Federation (hereinafter referred to as “the BFF”) respondents No. 4-11 are registered players of the BFF. Respondents Nos. 4-11 entered into a contract with the Petitioner-Club with effect from 10.12.2014 till the end of football season and filled up the prescribed player Registration Form of the BFF for the season 2014-2015 with distinct serial number for every players. On 10.12.2014, the Petitioner-Club signed the contract with respondent Nos. 4-11 and respondent No. 4-11 duly signed on the prescribed Contract Form supplied by the BFF (Annexure-C). As per the contract between the Petitioner-Club and the respondents Nos. 4-11, the period of contract would continue till the end of football season of 2014-2015. The season continued till 28.1.2016. The transfer of players started on 28.1.2016 and it continued till 20.03.2016. The Petitioner-Club was preparing its football players including respondent Nos. 4-11 for upcoming games including the AFC Cup to be held in March, 2016. Respondent No. 3, vide its letter dated 26.11.2015 (Annexure-D to the Writ Petition) informed the Petitioner-Club that SAFF SUZUKI Cup Tournament, 2015 would be held in Kerala, India under the management of South Asian Football Federation. Bangladesh National Team would participate in the tournament. For this a total of 28 footballers were primarily selected for joining in the residential camp for Bangladesh National team to form the Bangladesh National Team. The said list included top 12 players from the Petitioner-Club. Respondent No. 3 requested the Petitioner-Club to release 12 of its players including respondent Nos. 4-11 and report to the team manager of Bangladesh National Team at BKSP on 29.11.2015 (Annexure-D). In pursuance to the said letter of respondent No. 3 dated 26.11.2015, the Petitioner-Club released total 13 players contracted with the Petitioner-Club by its letter dated 27.12.2015. The Petitioner-Club by its letter dated 27.12.2015 requested respondent No. 3 to direct respondent Nos. 4-11 to report immediately to the Petitioner-Club after SAFF SUZUKI Cup 2015 was over (Annexure-E). In reply to the petitioner’s letter dated 27.12.2015, respondent No. 3, vide its letter dated 29.12.2015 informed the Petitioner-Club that 10 players from the Petitioner-Club were included in the National Football Team who would be coming back to Bangladesh on 31.12.2015 and 01.01.2016 after joining the SAFF SUZUKI Cup Tournament, 2015. Respondent No. 3 also informed the Petitioner-Club that “Bangabandhu Gold Cup International Football Tournament, 2016” would be held from 08.1.2016 to 20.1.2016 under the management of the BFF and total 8 teams would participate in the tournament. Respondent No. 3 requested the Petitioner-Club to release it’s aforesaid 13 players so that they can join in the residential training camp by 03.01.2016 for forming Bangladesh National Football Team. It was stated that the tournament would continue till 20.1.2016 and respondent No. 3 assured the Petitioner-Club that those players, that is, respondent Nos. 4-11 would return to the Petitioner-Club immediately after conclusion of the tournament (Annexure-F).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent No. 3 failed to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club as promised by him. The Bangladesh National Team lost to Bahrain in the semifinal of Bangabandhu International Football Tournament, 2016 and it was incumbent upon respondent No. 2 and 3 to return respondent Nos. 4-11 immediately to the Petitioner-Club for preparing for the AFC Cup Tournament to be held in March 2016. Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 failed to hand over respondents Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club. The Petitioner-Club issued two letters dated 24.1.2016 and 25.1.2016 requesting respondent No. 3 to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club. On 2.2.2016 and 19.2.2016, the Petitioner-Club made similar requests to respondent No. 3 for returning respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club. But despite repeated requests made by the Petitioner-Club, respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have not taken any step to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club as promised by respondent Nos. 2 and 3 in their letter dated 29.12.2015. Without resolving the issue of returning respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club, respondent No. 3 by his letter dated 22.2.2016 informed the Petitioner-Club that the Independence Cup Football Tournament, 2016 would be commencing from 30.3.2016 and respondent No. 3 requested the Petitioner-Club to sign and send the attached Participating Team Agreement Form within 10.03.2016. The Petitioner-Club by its letter dated 02.02.2016 clearly informed respondent No. 3 that respondent Nos. 4-11 were paid off fully for the last season and they were paid in advance for the next season and they were bound to play with the Petitioner-Club for the next season, but respondent Nos. 2 and 3 did not take any initiative to return the respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club.  The Petitioner-Club made several requests to respondent Nos. 2 and 3 for returning respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club. But respondent No. 3 failed to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club. Respondents Nos. 4-11 are under contractual obligation to the Petitioner-Club and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are under legal obligation to monitor compliance of the contractual obligation of the players but they failed to perform their duties by not returning respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club as promised by respondent No. 3.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the failure and the inaction of respondent Nos. 2 and 3 to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club, the Petitioner moved this Court and obtained the instant Rule Nisi.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner has filed Affidavit-in-Reply against the Affidavit-in-Oppositions filed by the respondents.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the Affidavit-in-Reply the petitioner has denied the statements made in the Affidavit-in-Oppositions filed by the contesting respondents. It has been stated in the Affidavit-in-Reply that respondent No. 3 stated in his Affidavit-in-Opposition dated 6.4.2016 that the Football season of 2014-2015 ended by December, 2015 and the contract of the players with the Petitioner-Club automatically ended by December, 2015. But this statement of Respondent No. 3 is not correct. In fact, the contract of the Petitioner-Club with respondent Nos. 4-11 continued till 20.1.2016, if not 28.01.2016. As per Regulation 22.3 of the Bangladesh Championship League 2014-2015, the Petitioner-Club had the opportunity to enter into a long term (maximum 5(five years) contract with respondents Nos. 4-11 and in fact with this end in view, the Petitioner-Club entered into a long term contract with respondent No. 4-11 and respondent Nos. 4-11 also accepted the money in advance from the Petitioner-Club. Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 failed to act according to the requests made by the Petitioner-Club. Respondent No. 3 had admitted that they were informed as back as on 03.01.2016 regarding the complaints made by the Petitioner-Club against three competing clubs and about taking advance money by respondent Nos. 4-11.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In respect of the affidavit-in-opposition dated 10.4.2016 filed by respondent No. 4, the Petitioner-Club has stated that respondent No. 4 has clearly admitted in paragraph 6, 8 and 9 that the Petitioner-Club had lawful contracts with respondents Nos. 4-11 till 20.1.2016. The statements made in paragraph No. 9 that respondent Nos. 4-11 have not received any money from the Petitioner-Club is not true as evident from Annexure-K series.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In respect of affidavit-in-opposition dated 7.4.2016 filed by the respondent Nos. 5-7, 9 and 10, the petitioner stated that these respondents have clearly admitted in paragraph Nos. 5 and 7 of their affidavit-in-opposition dated 7.4.2016 that the Petitioner-Club had lawful contract with respondent Nos. 4-11 till 27.012016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent Nos. 3, 4, 5-7, 9-10, 8 and 11 have entered appearance by filing  Affidavit-in-Opposition controverting all the material statements made in the Writ Petition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent No. 3 entered appearance by filing a separate affidavit-in-opposition denying the statements made in the writ petition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The case of respondent No. 3, in short, is that on 19.3.2016, respondent No. 3 after receiving letter dated 19.3.2016 from the Petitioner-Club informed the petitioner that the issue of returning or playing football by respondent Nos. 4-11 in Petitioner-Club has been sent to the Players’ Status Committee of the BFF and the decisions of the Players’ Status Committee would be communicated to the petitioner in due course. Subsequently, the meetings of the Players’ Status Committee held on 23.3.2016, 24.3.2016 and 27.3.2016 in presence of the petitioner, players and concerned authority. The Players’ Status Committee requested the Petitioner-Club to send representative of its club with necessary documents. During pendency of the decision of the Players’ Status Committee, the Petitioner-Club has filed the instant Writ Petition before this Court on 28.3.2016 and obtained the instant Rule Nisi.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On 27.3.2016, Sheikh Alamgir Kabir (Rana), respondent No. 11 has made a statements stating that he has received an additional amount of Tk.2,00,000/- (two lac) only from the Petitioner-Club and he is ready to return the said money as per direction of the BFF. Jamal Bhuiyan, respondent No. 8, another player, also made a statement on 27.3.2016 stating that though he has played AFC Cup but he did not receive any money from the Petitioner-Club. Raihan Hassan, respondent No. 6, on 27.3.2016, has also made statement stating that as per direction of the BFF he will refund an amount of Tk.7,00,000/- (Taka seven lac) to the Petitioner-Club.  Sohel Rana, respondent No. 10, has also made statement stating that he was compelled to sign some documents on pressure and he is ready to refund the money as per direction of the BFF. Md. Mamunul Islam (Mamun), respondent No. 9, who is the Captain of the Bangladesh National Team made a statement stating that he was taken to Gulshan by force and was compelled to sign some papers. The Petitioner-Club appeared at the hearing of the Players’ Status Committee but without waiting for the decision of the Players’ Status Committee, the petitioner has moved this Court and obtained the instant Rule Nisi.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent No. 3 has also filed Supplementary Affidavit-in-Opposition reiterating his earlier stand.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent No. 4 has also entered appearance by filing Affidavit-in-Opposition controverting the statement made in the Writ Petition. The case of respondent No. 4, in short, is that according to Clause 22.1 of the Regulations of Bangladesh Premier League, 2014-2015 (Annexure-1 to the Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by respondent No. 4), each player’s registration is only valid until the end of the football season, the date of which shall be determined annually by the BFF. If  a club contracts with a player for a longer period, the player must  register at the start of each season with the BFF. The tenure of the contract between respondent No. 4 and the Petitioner-Club ended on 20.1.2016. The contract between the Petitioner-Club and the respondent No. 4 expired on 20.1.2016. The Bangabandhu Gold International Football Tournament, 2016 ended on 20.1.2016 and as such there was no scope on the part of the BFF to return the players to the Petitioner-Club.  Respondent No. 4 has not received any money from the Petitioner-Club in advance for the season 2015-2016. Respondent No. 4 has not breached the contract by not returning back to the Petitioner-Club. The petitioner without exhausting the remedy available under the Statutes of Bangladesh Football Federation and the Regulations of the Bangladesh Premier League 2014-2015 has filed the instant writ petition and as such the Writ Petition is not maintainable and the Rule is liable to be discharged with costs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent Nos. 5-7, 9-10 have entered appearance by filing a separate within joint Affidavit-in-Opposition. The case of respondent Nos. 5-7, 9-10, in short, is that the contract between these respondents and the Petitioner-Club ended on 28.1.2016 and since the contract ended on 28.1.2016, there was no obligation upon the BFF to return these respondents to the Petitioner-Club after 28.1.2016. These respondents have entered into fresh contracts with Chittagong Abahani Limited for the season 2015-2016 and registered with the BFF. The petitioner by its letter dated 7.12.2015 addressed to the Chittagong Abahani Limited requested to lend two(2) players, namely, respondent Nos. 5 and 10  to the Petitioner-Club for the AFC Cup Tournament, 2016 (Annexure-2 of the Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by respondent No. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10). By this very letter, the petitioner has acknowledged that those players, that is, respondent Nos. 5 and 10 were the registered players of Chittagong Abahani Limited. Since the contract between the Petitioner-Club and these respondents ended on 28.1.2016, the issue of returning these respondents to the Petitioner-Club does not arise. The BFF does not perform any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of local authority and as such the present writ petition is not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Respondent Nos. 8 and 11 have also entered appearance by filing a separate written joint Affidavit-in-Opposition controverting all the material statements made in the writ petition. The short facts of the respondent No. 8 and 11 are that the BFF does not perform any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of local authority and as such the instant writ petition is not maintainable. The contract between these respondents and the Petitioner-Club was executed for the season 2014-2015 and the period of contract ended on 20.1.2016. These respondents did not extend the earlier contract or execute a new contract with the Petitioner-Club and they have not received any money in advance from the Petitioner-Club for the season 2015-2016. The money they have received was in settlement of their dues for the previous season. Respondent Nos. 8 and 11 have entered into new contracts with Sheikh Rasel Krirachakro for the season 2015-2016 and accordingly registered with the BFF as players of Sheikh Rasel Krirachakro for the season 2015-2016. The Petitioner-Club did not raise any objection to Sheikh Rasel Krirachakro to enlist these respondents as its players. Since the contract between the Petitioner-Club and these respondents ended on 20.1.2016, these respondents have no obligation to return back to the Petitioner-Club after 20.1.2016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Md. Ruhul Quddus, the learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that the Petitioner-Club by its letter dated 02.02.2016 paid in advance to respondents Nos. 4-11 for the season 2015-2016 and that respondent Nos. 4-11 are bound to play with the Petitioner-Club for the season 2015-2016. He further submits that respondent No. 2 and 3 have not taken any initiative to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club as promised by Respondent No. 3 in his letter dated 29.12.2015 (Annexure-F to the Writ Petition). He again submits that the Petitioner-Club has made several requests to respondent Nos. 2 and 3 for returning respondents Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club, but respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have not taken any step to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club. He next submits that respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have not taken any disciplinary action against respondent Nos. 4-11 for breach of contract by respondent Nos. 4-11 and such inaction of respondent Nos. 2 and 3 is liable to be declared to have been made without lawful authority and is of no legal effect. He also submits that under article 2(d) of the Statues of the BFF, (Annexure B to the Writ Petition), the BFF is legally bound to protect the interests of its members and the Petitioner-Club being a member of the BFF can legitimately expects that the BFF shall take all measures to protect the interest of the Petitioner-Club. He then submits that respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have failed to protect the interest of the Petitioner-Club by not returning respondents Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club on 19.01.2016 i.e. within the contractual period between the Petitioner-Club and the respondent Nos. 4-11. He also submits that respondent Nos. 4-11 were under contractual obligations with the Petitioner-Club till 19.01.2016 to play in favour of the Petitioner-Club and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 were under legal obligation to monitor compliance of the contract between the Petitioner-Club and the respondent Nos. 4-11 and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have failed to perform their legal duty by not returning respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club on 19.01.2016. He lastly submits that respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have utterly failed to perform their duty to return respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club as promised by respondent No. 3 and as such the Rule is liable to be made absolute.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Mohammad Mehedi Hasan Chowdhury, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No. 3, on the other hand, submits that the dispute between the Petitioner and the respondent Nos. 4-11 is contractual in nature and that the contract not being a statutory contract, the instant writ petition is not maintainable. He further submits that the dispute between the Petitioner and the respondent Nos. 4-11 involves disputed question of facts and that disputed question of facts cannot be resolved in writ jurisdiction. He then submits that the Petitioner-Club has filed the instant writ petition without exhausting the remedy available under the Statutes of Bangladesh Football Federation and  the instant writ petition is premature one and as such not maintainable. He next submits that the dispute between the Petitioner-Club and the respondent Nos. 4-11 is to be settled by the Players’ Status Committee of the BFF and that the petitioner appeared before the Players’ Status Committee and placed its submissions before the Players’ Status Committee, but during pendency of the decision of the Players’ Status Committee, the petitioner has filed the instant writ petition and obtained the instant Rule Nisi by suppressing the facts that the matter is pending before the Players’ Status Committee. He lastly submits that the present writ petition is misconceived and as such is liable to be discharged with costs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Omar Sadat, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No. 4, submits that the dispute between the petitioner and the respondent Nos. 4-11 is contractual in nature and that the contract not being a statutory contract does not attract the writ jurisdiction.  He further submits that the disputes involves disputed question of facts and that the disputed question of facts cannot be resolved by this Court sitting in writ jurisdiction. He lastly submits that the alleged contract between the Petitioner and the Respondent Nos. 4-11 is a private contract and as such the present writ petition is not maintainable in its present from and is liable to be discharged with costs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Mustafizur Rahman Khan, the learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 5-7, 9-10 submits that the contract between the Petitioner and these respondent Nos. 5-7, 9-10 is not a statutory contract and that the alleged contract is not enforceable in writ jurisdiction.  He further submits that the Petitioner by its letter dated 07.02.2016 (Annexure-2 to the Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by respondent Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10)   requested to the Abahani Limited, Chittagong to lend 2(two) players of Abahari Limited Chittagong, that is, respondent No. 5 and 10 to participate in the AFC Cup Tournament 2016 on behalf of the Petitioner and thereby acknowledged that respondent Nos. 5 and 10 are the players of Abahani Limited, Chittagong.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Md. Muniruzzaman, the learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 8 and 11 submits that the BFF is not performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of local authority and as such the instant writ petition is not maintainable. He further submits that the contract between these respondents and the Petitioner-Club was executed for the season 2014-2015 and that the period of contract between the Petitioner-Club and these respondents ended on 20.1.2016. He again submits that these respondents did not extend the earlier contract nor executed a new contract with the Petitioner-Club and that they have not received any money in advance from the Petitioner-Club for the season 2015-2016. He then submits that the money they have received was in settlement of their dues for the previous season. He next submits that respondents Nos. 8 and 11 have entered into a new contract with Sheikh Rasel Krirachakro for the season 2015-2016 and that they have registered with the BFF as players of Sheikh Rasel Krirachakro for the season 2015-2016. He lastly submits that since the contract between the Petitioner-Club and these respondents ended on 20.1.2016, these respondents have no obligation to return back to the Petitioner-Club after 20.1.2016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the learned advocates of all sides at length and perused the Writ Petition, its Annexures, Affidavit-in-Oppositions filed by the respondents, their Annexures, Supplementary Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by Respondent No. 3, its Annexures, and Affidavit-in-Reply filed by the petitioner against the Affidavit-in-Oppositions filed by the respondents and its Annexures.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now, let us address the first point first.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Mohammad Mehedi Hasan Chowdhury, the learned Advocate for respondent No. 3 and Mr. Md. Muniruzzaman, the learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 8 and 11 raised the point that the BFF does not perform any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of local authority, and as such the instant writ petition is not maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, Mr. Mustafizur Rahman Khan, the learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 5-7, 9-10 and Mr. Omar Sadat, the learned Advocate appearing for respondent Nos. 4 did not raise the point of maintainability.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Mustafizur Rahman Khan, the learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 5-7, 9-10 contends that earlier he was the Lawyer of a case relating to the BFF and that they went to the Appellate Division against an interim order passed by the High Court Division but the issue whether the BFF performs any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic or of local authority and whether writ petition against the BFF is maintainable or not have not been settled by the Appellate Division as yet. They also submit that the Rule is still pending in the High Court Division. So, the learned Lawyers namely, Mr. Mustafizur Rahman Khan and Mr. Omar Sadat during their submissions did not raise the question of maintainability. They candidly admitted that the matter is yet to be settled by the Appellate Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, Mr. Md. Muniruzzaman, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent Nos. 8 and 11 refers to the case of Shahabuddin (Md) Vs. Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Sports and others, reported in 45 DLR 360 and submits that Bangladesh Football Federation is an affiliated national sports organization of Bangladesh Sports Council under the Bangladesh Sports Council Act, 1974 (Act No. LVII of 1974), but it does not become a body or authority constituted or established by the Government under any law to mean a local authority within the meaning of Article 102(2)(a)(ii) of the Constitution and as such the present writ petition is not maintainable. The above judgment of the High Court Division was passed on 02.5.1991.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Md. Ruhul Quddus, the learned Advocate for the petitioner, on the other hand, refers to an unreported case of A. F. Shahab Uddin Ahmed Vs. National Shooting Federation, Bangladesh, South East Corner of Gulshan Model Town, P.S. Gulshan, Dhaka and others, (Writ Petition No. 3494 of 2010) and submits that a Division Bench of this Court very recently held that the National Shooting Federation is amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 102 of the Constitution. In the case of A.F.M. Shahab Uddin Ahmed Vs. National Shooting Federation Bangladesh, South East Corner of Gulshan Model Town, P.S. Gulshan, Dhaka and others (Writ Petition No. 3494 of 2010), a Division Bench of this Court has held in no uncertain terms that in consensus National Shooting Federation is amenable to writ jurisdiction. This judgment was passed by a Division Bench of this Court on 12.12.2010. .</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocates of both sides candidly admitted that they were not in a position to refer any decision of the Appellate Division on the point whether the BFF is amenable to writ jurisdiction or not. The BFF is an affiliated National Sports Organization of the Bangladesh Sports Council under the Schedule Part-I of the Bangladesh Sport Council Act, 1974 (Act No. LVII of 1974). The National Sports Council has been created by the Bangladesh Sports Council Act, 1974 (Act No. LVII of 1974) and the Bangladesh Football Federation has been included in Schedule Part-I of the Bangladesh Sport Council Act, 1974. Therefore, we are in respectful agreement with the principle enunciated in the judgment passed by the High Court Division in the case of A. F. Shahab Uddin Ahmed Vs National Shooting Federation, Bangladesh, South East Corner of Gulshan Model Town, P.S. Gulshan, Dhaka and others, in Writ Petition No. 3494 of 2010 and hold the view that Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is amenable to writ jurisdiction.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It may be mentioned here that the Bangladesh Shooting Federation and the Bangladesh Football Federation have been included in the Schedule Part-I of the Bangladesh Sports Council Act, 1974. The Bangladesh Shooting Federation and the Bangladesh Football Federation being included in the Schedule Part-I of the Bangladesh Sports Council Act, 1974, both the sports organizations have the same standing.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Since a Division Bench of this Court in the case of A. F. Shahabuddin Ahmed Vs. National Shooting Federation (Writ Petition No. 3494 of 2010) has held that Bangladesh Shooting Federation is amenable to writ jurisdiction, the BFF being a sports organization of same standing with Bangladesh Shooting Federation (both are included in the Schedule Part-I of the National Sports Council Act, 1974) is also amenable to writ jurisdiction.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now let us address other points raised in this writ petition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The specific case of the Petitioner-Club is that respondent Nos. 4-11 entered into a contract with the Petitioner-Club to play on behalf of the Petitioner-Club for the season 2014-2015. While these respondents were playing in the Petitioner-Club as per the contract, respondent No. 3 requested the Petitioner-Club to hand over respondent Nos. 4-11 players to respondent No. 3 for participating in the SAFF Suzuki Cup Tournament, 2015 to be held in Kerala, India. The Petitioner-Club and all other clubs under the BFF are legally bound to send the players to respondent No. 3, that is, to the BFF whenever requested by the BFF for participating in the tournament on behalf of Bangladesh Team. Accordingly, on 29.12.2015, the Petitioner-Club sent 12 of its players including respondent Nos. 4-11 to respondent No. 3 for participating in the SAFF SUZUKI Cup Tournament to be held in Kerala, India on the condition that after the Suzuku-Cup Tournament was over, respondent No. 3, that is, the BFF shall return those players to the Petitioner-Club. The request letter of respondent No. 3, dated 26.11.2015 has been annexed as Annexure-D to the writ petition. For proper appreciation, Annexure-D is quoted below which runs as under:</li></ol><strong>“</strong><strong>বাংলাদেশ ফুটবল ফেডারেশন</strong><br/><em>BANGLADESH FOOTBALL FEDERATION</em><br/><strong>সূত্রঃ ৩১২৫(১০)/বাফুফে-সাফ/২০১৫                   তারিখঃ ২৬-১১-২০১৫</strong><br/>সম্পাদক/ডাইরেক্টর-ইন-চার্জ/ভারপ্রাপ্ত ডাইরেক্টর-ইন-চার্জ/<br/>সাধারণ সম্পাদক/মহাব্যবসহাপক/মহাসচিব/সদস্য সচিব<br/>লেঃ শেখ জামাল ধানমন্ডি ক্লাব লিঃ<br/><strong>বিষয়ঃ</strong> <u>বাংলাদেশ জাতীয় ফুটবল দলের আবাসিক প্রশিক্ষণ ক্যাম্পে যোগদান প্রসঙ্গে।</u><br/><strong>জনাব, </strong><br/>উপর্যুত্তু বিষয়ে আপনার অবগতি ও প্রয়োজনীয় কার্যার্থে জানানো যাচ্ছে যে, আগামী ২৩ ডিসেম্বর ২০১৫ হতে ০৩ জানুযারী ২০১৬ তারিখ পর্যমত সাউথ এশিয়ান ফুটবল ফেডারেশন (সাফ) এর ব্যবসহপানায় "সাফ সুজুকি কাপ ২০১৫' এর খেলা ভারতের কেরালায় অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। উত্তু টুর্নামেন্টে বাংলাদেশসহ আফগানিসতান, ভারত, পাকিসতান, নেপাল, ভুটান, মালদ্বীপ ও শ্রীলংকা অংশগ্রহণ করবে। এ প্রেক্ষিতে প্রাথমিকভাবে নির্বাচিত ২৮ সদস্য বিশিষ্ট বাংলাদেশ জাতীয় ফুটবল দলের একটি আবাসিক প্রশিক্ষন ক্যাম্প অাগামী ২৯ নভেম্বর ২০১৫ তারিখ হতে পর্যমত সাভারসহ বিকেএসপিতে অনুষ্ঠিত হবে।<br/>উল্লেখিত আলোকে আপনার ক্লাব ফুটবল দলের অধিনসহ সংশ্লিষ্ট খেলোয়াড়/ খেলোয়াড়গণকে তাদের আনুষাঙ্গিক ত্রুীড়া সামগ্রীসহ সাভারসহ বিকেএসপিতে অনুষ্ঠিতব্য বাংলাদেশ জাতীয় ফুটবল দলের আবাসিক প্রশিক্ষণ ক্যাম্পে যোগদানের লক্ষ্যে টিম ম্যানেজার জনাব মোঃ আমিরতল ইসলাম বাবু এর নিকট আগামী ২৯ নভেম্বর ২০১৫ তারিখ দুপুর ১২.০০ ঘটিকায় সাভারসহ বিকেএসপিতে রিপোর্ট করার প্রয়োজনীয় ব্যবসহা গ্রহণের জন্য আপনাকে বিশেষভাবে অনুরোধ জানানো যাচ্ছে।<br/>অতীতের ন্যায় আপনার সহযোগিতা একামতভাবে কাম্য।<br/>অাপনার বিশ্বসত,<br/>বাংলাদেশ ফুটবল ফেডারেশন<br/>স্বাঃ-<br/>মোঃ আবু নাইম সোহাগ<br/>সাধারণ সম্পাদক<br/><strong>সংযুত্তিু</strong><br/>২৮ সদস্য বিশিষ্ট বাংলাদেশ জাতীয় ফুটবল দলের প্রাথমিক খেলোয়াড় তালিকা।<br/><strong>বাংলাদেশ ফুটবল ফেডারেশন</strong><br/><em>BANGLADESH FOOTBALL FEDERATION</em><br/><em><u>BANGLADESH FOOTBALL FEDERATON</u></em><br/><em><u>SAFF SUZUKI CUP 2015</u></em><br/><em><u>PRELIMINARY PLAYERS LIST OF BANGLADESH NATION FOOTBALL TEAM</u></em><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:288px"><tbody><tr><td style="width:36px"><strong><em>Sl.

By the letter dated 24.1.2016 (Annexure-H) the Petitioner-Club requested to the BFF to exercise its good office so that the players, that is, respondent Nos. 4-11 cannot transfer to other clubs. Annexure-H series to the Writ Petition show that the Petitioner by its letters dated 24.1.2016 (Annexure-H), dated 25.1.2016 (Annexure-H-1) dated 26.1.2016 (Annexure-H-2) dated 2.2.2016 (Annexure-H-3) and dated 19.3.2016 (Annexure-H-4 to the writ petition) intimated to the BFF that the Petitioner-Club made repeated requests to the BFF to return the players of the Petitioner-Club and also requested to the BFF to take proper steps so that the players, that is, respondents Nos. 4-11 return to the Petitioner-Club camp and also requested to the BFF to exercise its good office so that these players cannot transfer to other club/clubs and contract with other club/clubs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts remain that respondent Nos. 4-11 entered into a contract with the Petitioner-Club for the period of 2014-2015 and the contract period started from 10.12.2014 till “the end of football season”. The words, “till end of football season” seem to be vague and carry some confusion as to the validity of the period of the contract. But, fortunately, the parties agreed that the contract between the Petitioner-Club and the Respondent Nos. 4-11 remained in force till 20.1.2016. The date of transfer of the players to different club/clubs of their choice was fixed by the BFF from 20.1.2016 to 20.3.2016. The players are supposed to transfer to the different club/clubs of their choice within the period from 20.1.2016 to 20.3.2016. In fact, this period from 20.1.2016 to 20.3.2016 is given to the players by the BFF to choose the club of their (players) choice.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The players, that is, respondent Nos. 4-11 first reported to the BFF for playing the SAAF Suzuki Cup Tournament 2015 and thereafter for playing the ʻBangabandhu Gold Cup International Football Tournament, 2016ʼ. The SAAF Suzuki Cup Tournament 2015 ended on 31.12.2015 and the players came back to Bangladesh on 31.12.2015 and 01.01.2016. After ending the SAAF Suzuki Cup Tournament, 2015 on 31.12.2015, the players including respondent Nos. 4-11 came to Bangladesh on 31.12.2015 and 01.01.2016. But again the BFF requisitioned the payers of the Petitioner-Club for participating in the ʻBangabandhu Gold Cup International Football Tournament 2016ʼ to be held from 8.1.2016 to 20.1.2016 and the BFF requested the Petitioner-Club to release its players so that they may report to the BFF camp by 3.1.2016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After participating the SAFF Suzuki Cup Tournament, 2015, the players came to Bangladesh on 31.12.2015 and 01.1.2016. Again they were supposed to report to the BFF by 03.1.2016 for playing in the “Bangabandhu Gold Cup International Football Tournament, 2016”. The BFF requested to the Petitioner-Club to release its players so that they can report to the BFF camp by 3.1.2016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The ʻBangabandhu Gold Cup International Football Tournament, 2016ʼ concluded on 20.1.2016 and Bangladesh lost to Bahrain on 18.01.2016. Respondent Nos. 4-11 got 2 (two) days time to report to Petitioner-Club from 18.01.2016 to 20.1.2016. The contract between the Petitioner-Club and the respondent Nos. 4-11 remained valid upto 20.1.2016. In fact, after 20.1.2016 respondent Nos. 4-11 were not the players of the Petitioner-Club. But the problem arose when they accepted money in advance from the Petitioner-Club for the next football season, that is, for the season 2015-2016. The petitioner alleges that according to clause 22.3 of the Regulations of Bangladesh Championship League 2014-2015 (Annexure-J to the Affidavit-in-Reply filed by the Petitioner) (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) contracts between the clubs and the professional players may be for a maximum period of 5 (five) years.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Clause 22.3 of the Regulations is quoted below, which runs as under:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"> </li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">(emphasis supplied)</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Clause 22.1 of the Regulations of the Bangladesh Championship League 2014-2015, is also relevant. So, we are inclined to quote Clause 22.1 of the Regulations which runs as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>22.1 A player is eligible to play in the Competition provided he fulfills all the following conditions:</em><br/><em>He is duly registered with the BFF by the Participating Clubs according to the provisions of these Regulations. Each player’s registration is only valid until the end of the football season, the date of which shall be determined annually by BFF. Where a player is contracted by a club for a longer period, the player must be registered at the start of each season.</em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">So, according to Clause 22.1 and 22.3 of the Regulations, the Clubs may enter into a contract with the professional players for a long period for a maximum of five (5) years.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">These players, that is, respondents Nos. 4-11 contracted with the Petitioner-Club to play on behalf of the Petitioner-Club for the season 2014-2015. Admittedly there was no contract between the Petitioner-Club and the respondents Nos. 4-11 after 20.1.2016. But the learned Advocate for the Petitioner contends that they had their legitimate expectations that respondent Nos. 4-11, players would play on behalf of the Petitioner-Club as they had accepted the money in advance from the Petitioner-Club for the next season, that is, for the session 2015-2016. It is true that some of the players have stated that they have not accepted money in advance from the Petitioner-Club, but their contentions are not true. Some of the players stated that they were compelled to accept the money under coercion and they were ready to pay the money back to the Petitioner-Club. From Annexure-K series to the Affidavit-in-Reply filed by the petitioner show that Shahidul Alam Sohel (Respondent No. 4) admitted by his letter dated 3.1.2016 that he took Tk.20,00,000/- (twenty lac) from Abahani Limited for the Football Season 2016 while he was a player of Petitioner-Club. He regretted and apologised for his deeds. This letter was written by respondent No. 4 on 3.1.2016 (Annexure-K) and admittedly at that time, that is, on 3.1.2016, respondent No. 4 was the player of the Petitioner-Club. Similarly, Annexure-K series to the Affidavit-in-Reply filed by the Petitioner show that all other players, that is, respondents Nos. 5-11 apologised and admitted that they took money in advance from the Petitioner-Club, but they were ready to give the money back to the Petitioner-Club. Therefore, we find that the facts remain that respondent Nos. 4-11 took money from the Petitioner-Club in advance for the season 2015-2016. In fact, all the players admitted that they have taken money in advance from the Petitioner-Club for the season 2015-2016 (Annexure-K series to the Affidavit-in-Reply filed by the Petitioner). Some players allege that they were compelled to take money in advance from the Petitioner-Club under coercion. But they did not even lodge any G.D Entry against the Petitioner-Club. Even they did not intimate the matter to the BFF soon after the alleged occurrence took place. Respondent Nos. 4-11 are the national players and we are proud of them, they are our Ambassadors when they play abroad on behalf of Bangladesh and they carry our national flag outside Bangladesh. We have all the respect and praise for them. But at the same time we expect that they should abide by the Rules and Regulations of the BFF and the FIFA. In the instant case we find that respondent Nos. 4-11 have entered into a contract with other club after they accepted money in advance from the Petitioner-Club for the session 2015-2016. We are sorry to say, we do not approve such behavior of our players. The Petitioner-Club has intimated to the BFF by   its letters dated 24.1.2016, 25.1.2016, 26.1.2016, 02.2.2016 and 19.3.2016 (Annexure-H series to the Writ Petition) and requested to the BFF to intervene and exercise its good office so that respondent Nos. 4-11 cannot enter into contract with any other club/clubs for the session 2015-2016. The BFF, however, did not sit with it and it has rightly forwarded the matter to the Players’ Status Committee after receipt of the letter dated 19.3.2016 from the Petitioner-Club.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The entire matter is now in the seisin of the Players’ Status Committee. The composition of Players’ Status Committee has been described in Article 53 of the Statutes of Bangladesh Football Federation (Annexure-B to the writ petition). Article 53 of the above Statues runs as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>53. Players’ Status Committee</em><br/><em>The Players’ Status Committee shall set up and monitor compliance with transfer regulations in accordance with the FIFA Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players and determine the status of Players for various competitions of BFF. The Executive Committee may draw up special regulations governing the Players’ Status Committee’s powers of jurisdiction. The Players’ Status Committee shall consist of a chairman, a deputy chairman and three members.</em><br/><em>Players’ status disputes involving BFF, its Members and Players, Officials and match and players’ agents shall be settled by an Arbitration Tribunal in accordance with these Statutes.</em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Article 5.1 of the Statutes of the BFF (Annexure-B to the Writ Petition) states that the status of Players and the provisions for their transfer shall be regulated by the Executive Committee of the BFF through ‘Player’s Status Committee’ as envisaged with the current FIFA Regulations for the ‘Status and Transfer of Players’.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, from the above, we find that transfer of players shall be regulated by the Executive Committee of the BFF through the Players’ Status Committee. From the above, we also find that the dispute in respect of the status of the players (respondent Nos. 4-11) can well be solved by the Players’ Status Committee and the Players’ Status Committee is legally competent to solve the problem regarding the status of the players, namely, respondent Nos. 4-11.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have discussed vividly that according to Article 53 of the Status of Bangladesh Football Federation (Annexure-B to the Writ Petition), the Players’ Status Committee shall monitor compliance with transfer regulations in accordance with the FIFA Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players and determine the status of Players for various competitions of the BFF. The Executive Committee may draw up special regulations governing the Players’ Status Committee’s powers of jurisdiction. The Players’ Status Committee shall consist of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and three members. Players’ Status Committee is a quite high powered committee and this committee is fully empowered and competent to determine the status of the players.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Petitioner-Club specifically alleges that respondents Nos. 4-11 accepted the money in advance from the Petitioner-Club, in January 2016, for the season 2015-2016, while they entered into a contract with Sheikh Russel Kriachakro and Abahabi Limited Chittagong in March 2016, long after they accepted money in advance from the Petitioner-Club. This dispute is required to be resolved by the Players’ Status Committee. The BFF by its letter dated 19.3.2016 informed the Petitioner-Club that as soon as the decision is taken by the Players’ Status Committee, the BFF shall inform the decision to the Petitioner-Club. The meetings of the Players’ Status Committee held on 25.3.2016, 27.3.2016, 28.3.2016 (Annexure-4, 4(A), 4(B), 4(C) to the Supplementary Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by respondent No. 3). The Petitioner-Club was requested to send representative to attend the meeting of the Players’ Status Committee. Accordingly, the Petitioner-Club attended the meeting and submitted its statements before the Players’ Status Committee. The last meeting of the Players’ Status Committee held on 28.3.2016 and the present Rule was issued on the same date i.e. on 28.3.2016. Therefore, further meeting of the Players’ Status Committee could not be held.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, composition and functions of the Players’ Status Committee show that the Players’ Status Committee is legally competent to resolve the dispute in question among the BFF, the Petitioner-Club and the respondent Nos. 4-11.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Mohammad Mehedi Hasan Chowdhury, the learned Advocate for respondent No. 3 refers to the case of Bangladesh Power Development Board and others Vs Md. Asaduzzaman Sikder, reported in 8 MLR (AD) 241 and submits that remedy against breach of contract pure and simple is not available in writ jurisdiction and unless the contract is a statutory one the remedy against breach thereof is not available in writ jurisdiction. There is no dispute about the decision cited above. The learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that they have not sought relief to enforce the contract between the Petitioner-Club and the respondents Nos. 4-11, rather they have sought relief against respondent No. 3 for his inaction and failure to return the players, that is, respondent Nos. 4-11 to the Petitioner-Club. In our opinion, the above decision has no manner of application in the instant case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have already held that the Players’ Status Committee is competent to resolve the disputes among the Petitioner-Club, respondent No. 3, and respondent Nos. 4-11. We direct the Players’ Status Committee to resolve the matter in dispute among the Petitioner-Club, the respondent Nos. 4-11 and the BFF within 2(two) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">However, at the time of resolving the dispute, the Players’ Status Committee shall decide the matter independently, but at the same time it must take into consideration the relevant Rules, Regulations etc. of the BFF and the FIFA.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Considering all these facts and circumstances and in the light of the discussions made hereinbefore, we are in the opinion that the Rule is liable to be disposed of.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the Rule is disposed of.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Players’ Status Committee is directed to dispose of the dispute among the Petitioner-Club, the respondent No. 3 and the respondent Nos. 4-11 within 2(two) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment as per the observations made in the body of the judgment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The interim order passed by this Court at the time of issuance of the Rule on 28.3.2016 is hereby recalled and vacated. There is no order as to costs.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Against which the plaintiff as appellant the instant appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts in a nutshell giving rise to this appellant are that the suit land described in the schedule of the plaint along with other land appertaining C.S Khatian No. 101 comprising an area of 13.41 acres of land originally belonged to Gopal Mondal and during last settlement and survey operation, the record of right of the said land was prepared in his name; Gopal Mondal having been in possession and enjoyment therefore transferred the same by Heba-bil-Ewaz being deed No. 5018 dated 16.11.1918 in favour of his three grand sons, namely Sheikh Naimuddin, Sheikh Kalomuddin and Kafiluddin thereafter, Sheikh Naimuddin having been inducted into possesseion and enjoyment of his share, he transferred 0.53 acres of land by a registered kabala being No. 10479 dated 20.06.53 in favour of one Momiruddin Munshi.

On 7.7.2007 defendant nos .1-3 came to the suit land demanding that they are the owners of the suit same, the plaintiff through searching found that a kabala being No. 18324 dated 5.7.2007 was registered in the Sub-Register Office of Gazipur; having been obtained a certified copy of said registered deed by the plaintiff on 18.7.2007, has come to learn that defendant Nos. 4-10 being vendors executed deed on 5.7.2007 in favour of the defendant Nos.1-3 who in Collusion with each other created a forged, fake and frivolous deed; the defendant Nos. 1-3 had never been in possession, nor they had any right and title over the suit land; and as a matter of fact the said deed was never acted- upon rather it was a mere piece of paper transaction only, therefore, the plaintiff brought the instant suit as aforesaid.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The defendant Nos.1-3 entered appearance upon filing a written statement denying all material allegations made in the plaint contending inter alia that the land measuring 0.1039 acres if land appertaining to C.S Khatian No. 101 and 0.336 acres of land appertaining to C.S Khatian No. 15 under the same Mouza having been in possession and enjoyment thereof by Gopal Mondal who transferred the aforesaid entire land in favour of Sheikh Naimuddin, Sheikh Kalom uddin and Sheikh Kafiluddin by a Heba-bil-Ewaz No. 5018 dated 16.11.1918; thereafter, Sheikh Kalomuddin died leaving behind his only daughter named Halimunnessa who inherited her father`s property appertaining C.S Khatian No. 101 corresponding to plot No. 298 and having been in possession and enjoyment thereof along with other land, sold <strong>0.68</strong> acres of land to Ahid Ali and Sonaullah by registered kabala being No.9240 dated 2.10.1967 and therefore their names were correctly recorded along with other land in S.A Khatian No. 124; Said Ahid Ali and Sonaullah having been inducted into possesson and enjoyment thereof transferred 34acres of land by a registered kabala dated 21.4.73 in favour of Hafiz uddin, son of Sheikh Naimuddin; upon purchase and inheritance Hafizuddin having been inducted into possession and enjoyment thereof sold 0.24 acres of land from plot No. 298 and .04 acres of land from former plot No. 348 in total 0.28 acres of land in favour of one Md.

During-g trial 4 issues were framed b te trial Court and the plaintiff examined as many as 4 witnesses including himself in support of his case while defendants examined 3 witnesses in the suit; after conclusion of trial the learned Joint District Judge, Additional Court, Gazipur dismissed the suit by Judgment and decree date 16.06.2003 in Title Suit No, 196 of 2007 against which the plaintiff as appellant preferred the instant appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. afsarudiin Ahmed  khan, with Mr. Monjurul Karim kazal, the learned Advocate appellant has taken us through the relevant materials for the purpose of disposal of appeal including plaint =, written statement, deposition of witnesses, Advocate commission fact by both parties that the suit land in question along with other land Originally belonged to Gopal Mondol who transferred the entire   property to his three  grand sons  by a Heba-bil-Ewaz  and the plaintiff purchased 0.30 acres of land the actual R.S recorded  owners who are also subsequent successors of the Original owner named Gopal Monndol. He further submits that during pendency of the trial an Advocate commission was held on 13.09.2007 as per   courts order wherefrom it transpires that a semi pacca house, boundary wall had been constructed 5/6 months before holding commission, on the country, respondents being defendants stated in their written statement that they purchased the suit land on 05.07.2007 which proves that the construction of the suit land by the defendants. The learned Advocate further submitted for the appellant that the predecessor of the plaintiff named P.W.4 Tofazzal Hossain purchased the suit land from the heirs of Moniruddin Munshi in whose favour the R.S record Stands and he paid revenue to the government in respect  of suit land till 1412 B.S.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Abdul Haque the learned Advocate appearing for the respondents submits that the suit brought by the appellant as plaintiff, in no way , has been proved by adducing evidence on record and the plaintiff has failed to prove his case as to the possession and enjoyment thereof. He further submits that the weakness of the defendant has no ground for grating decree in favour of the plaintiff in the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having heard the learned advocates from both sides, we therefore, feel it proper to assess and evaluate that the appellant as plaintiff has examined 4 witnesses including himself in the suit of whom plaintiff as P.W.1 deposed before the trial Court to the effect that Gopal Mondal was the Original C.S recorded owner of the suit land and he transferred the entire property by deed No, 5018 dated 16.11.1918 in favour of his three grand sons namely Kalimuddin, Salimuddin and Naimuddin and the same were correctly recorded in their names upon preparing S.A Khatian No. 124 Thereafter, Naimuddin sold 0.53 acres of land by a res of land by a registered kabala being No. 10479 (as amended by this cooourt on prayer )in  favour of Momiiruddin munshi and the record of right was prepared in  his name by S.A khatian and subsequently R.S  Khatian. Said Momiruddin Munshi died Leaving behind his wife, two sons and four daughters while kafiluddin die. Leaving behind his wife and two sons. Thereafter, the heirs of Momiruddin Munshi transferred 0.44 ½ acres of land by a kabala No. 5913 dated 17.03.2005 to one Tofazzal Hossain who after Mutating the same in his name, paid rent to the Government. From the said land, Tofazzal Hossain transferred 0.30 acres of land by a registers=d kabala being No. 13018 dated 04.06.2005 in favour of the plaintiff who also paid revenue to the Government after mutating the same in his favour P.W.1 deposed further that he having been in possession and enjoyment thereof, constructed boundary wall and built a tin shed house over the suit land,. He further testified that on 07.07.2007 defendant Nos. 1-3 came to the suit land demanding ownership of the same. Thereafter, he (P.W.1) collected certified copy of the deed No. 18324 dated 05.07.2007 ehicj has been marked as exhibit 1,P.W.1 further Produced certificate copies of deed No 5018 dated 16.11.1918 (admitted by both parties), marked as exhibit-2, R.S. Khatian No. 102 market as exhibit-3, deed No.5913 dated 17.03.2005 marked as exhibit-4 (corrected by this Court’s order on prayer) deed No. 13018 dated 04.06.2005 market as exhibit- 4(ka) (corrected by this Court on prayer ), mutation Khatian No. 18470/2005/2006 market as exhibit-5 and D.C.R. and khatian market as exhibit 5 series. The plaintiff as P.W.1 denied the place of the defendants adding that the defendant has no right, title and interest over the suit land.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having gone through the cross-examination portion of PW.1 we find no discrepancy of his testimony with the deposition as well as his plaint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Md. Mahabubul Alom, an Advocate as P.W.2 deposed to the effect that he served notices on 05.09.2007 upon the learned Advocates of both parties before holding the commission and on 13.09.2007 the commission was held in presence of the both parties and he submitted the report on 26.09.2007. He has denied that he did not give false report and the same was not beyond writ, issued by the court. In his cross examination he disclosed that a tin shed house and the boundary wall had been built up over the suit land 5/6 months before holding the commission.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">From the evidence of P.W.2 and his commission report it reveals that the neighbours disclosed in presence of persons of the commission that the tin shed house and boundary wall were built befour the transferring the land in favour of the defendants as alleged.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Md. Abul Kashem as P.W.3 deposed to the effect that the plaintiff, defendant and the suit land are known to him. He has a land beside the suit land. The plaintiff has been possessing and enjoying the suit land. The plaintiff has a house thereon and fencing of barbed wire around the suit land, and the plaintiff has also other land by the northern-southern side of the suit land. This Witness however categorically stated about the actual position of the suit land as claimed by the plaintiff. This testimony of P.W.3 has supported the evidence of P.W.1 as well as plaint brought by plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Md  Mofazzal Hossain as P.W.4 deposed that he knows plaintiff, defendants and the suit land and he having been inducted into the possession and enjoyment thereof, sold the suit land in favor of the plaintiff and handed over the possession too and there is a fencing of barbed wire around the suit land which was filled up by clay/earth and the plaintiff has been possessing and enjoying the suit land since its transfer by him. During cross examination this witness admitted that he did not go further to the suit land after sale which he sold two years before. He also denied suggestion that he sold the suit land though he was not in possession of the same and the possession of the suit land was not handed over to the plaintiff by him.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">From a close scrutiny of evidence of this witness we find no deviation between the deposition and testimony of cross-examination as disclosed by this witness. This witness being the predecessor of the plaintiff is a very important witness in this case. His testimony corroborated the evidence of other witness regarding the possession and ownership of the suit land as alleged by the plaintiff-P.W.1.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The respondents as defendants examined as many as 3 witnesses in the suit whom defendant-Farid Ahmed as D.W.1 deposed before the trail Court stating that he along with 2 other defendants purchased the land and he himself and on behalf of defendant Nos. 2-3 gives evidence in the Court. The suit land appertains to C.S khatian 101 S.A. 124, R.S 102 and C.S. 15 khatians are not known to him. Gopal Mondal was the original owner of the land appertaining to C.S khatian No. 101 and C.S khatian No. 15, certified copies of the said khatians have been marked as exhibit-ka series. Gopal Mondal being the owner of the land of both two khatians, transferred the entire property in favour of his three grand sons namely Kalimuddin, Naimuddin and Salimuddin by a Heba-bil-Ewaz deed No. 5018 dated 16.11.1918, a certified copy of the same has been produced. The said grand sons had obtained equal share of the land by the aforesaid deed. Among them Kalimuddin died leaving behind his only daughter Halimunnessa who having been in possession and enjoyment thereof transferred 0.68 ½ acres of land in favour of Ahid ullah and Sonaullah by a registered deed No. 9240 dated 2.10. 1967, a certified of said deed has been marked as exhibit-kha and their names along with others were correctly recorded in the S.A. khatian, the certified copy of the said khatian has been marked as exhibit-ga. Ahid ullah and Sonaullah having been in possession and enjoyment thereof transferred 0.34 acres of land in favour of Hafizuddin in the year, 1973. By inheritance and purchase Hafizuddin become the owner of the land and his name was recorded in the khatian. Thereafter Hafizuddin sold out 0.28 acres of land in favour of Md. Amzad Khan by a registered deed No.1083 dated 8.2.1977 which has been marked as exhibit-gha. Said Amzad Khan having been inducted into possession and enjoyment thereof transferred the said land to Ibnul Hasan, Rabeya Rashid and Rezia Rashid by three registered deed Nos.8581,8582 and 8583 dated 30.6.1980 which have been marked as exhibit- “Umma series.” Therefore, they mutated their Names in the record of right when they were in possession and enjoyment thereof through Mutation Case No4192/87-88 and they also paid rent to the government, copies of the said khatian, D.C.R. and rent receipts have been marked as exhibit-cha-series. Ibnul Hasan died leaving behind his wife, one son Moinul Hasan and 5 daughters. Rabeya, Rezia and the heirs of Ibnul Hasan transferred the said 0.28 acres of land in favour of defendant Nos.1-3 by a registered deed No.2374/07-08 upon getting possession over the land. The copies of the mutation khatians, D.C.R have been marked as exhibit-Chha-series. This witness further testified to the effect that they have constructed boundary wall around the suit land and built a three structured rooms over the suit land and electric line had been connected while gas line was under process. This D.W.1 denied all allegations, brought by the plaintiff in the suit. This witness on recall further produced certified copies of the deed Nos.3705 and 3706 dated 21.4.2007 which has been marked as exhibit-Ja.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">From a careful reading of evidence of the aforesaid witness we find that the original owner of the suit land is admitted by both sides and at one stage during cross-examination this witness disclosed worthy evidence in support of plaintiff’s case, which is quoted below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   <strong>’’সত্য নয় যে, মমিন ঊদ্দিন সহ অন্যান্য শরীকদের নামে এস, এ ১২৪ ও আর এস ১০২ সহ খতিয়ান সঠিক ভাবে রেকর্ড হয়েছে। পরে বলেন মমিন উদ্দিন খরিদ করে থাকলে তার নামে সঠিক ভাবে এস. এ / আর. এস রেকর্ড হতে পারে।’’</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Md. Ismail Hossain as D.W.2 deposed that he knows both plaintiff and the defendants as well as suit land. His brother is the owner of some land situates on western side of the suit land. Defendants claimed the ownership of the suit land comprising an area of 0.28 acres of and upon purchase a few days before wherein a semi pacca tin shed-house exists and there is a boundary wall on the northern side and three other sides are being encircled by fencing of barbed wire. This witness further admits during cross examination that the plaintiff has a house over the suit land which he owns and further admits that there was a sign board lying with the house with the name of Farid Athmed (plaintiff) was seen over the suit land He further restified that the house of the defendants is situated ¾ kilomitres  away from the suit land. He does not know the C.S, S.A. and R.S. khatians of the suit land but he knows the suit land under R.S. dag which contains total area of 0.113 acres of land but he can not say the ratio of the land belongs to each person concerned.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Md.  Almas as D.W.3 testified that he knows plaintiff and defendants as well as suit land and his house situates on his own land beside the suit land. Anis and Farid have been possessing and enjoying the suit land and there is a wall on one side and three other sides are encircled by fencing around the suit land. During cross-examination this witness admits that the plaintiff resides near the suit land and he does not know how much land are involved in the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is also found from the evidence as disclosed by the witnesses that the plaintiff became the owner of the suit land which successively devolved upon him from the admitted original owner named Gopal Mondal. It has also been observed by us from the evidence of witnesses that Momiruddin Munshi is the predecessor of the plaintiff whose name was correctly recorded in respect of suit land along with other land but the plea made by the respondents as defendants is that Momiruddin Munshi purchased only 0.53 acres of land, how an area of 0.113 acres of lands appertaining S.A. Khatian No.124 and R.S Khatian 102 had been recorded in his name, this plea is not sustainable as there are other co-sharers in the land, disclosed by D.W-3 and the same has been misread by the Joint District Judge in his Judgment and decree dated 16.6.2009.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The finding of the Trial Court has drawn our attention to some extent as quoted below:-“</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>আবার হাবিজ উদ্দিন দত্ত্বীয় মোঃ আমজাদ খান বরাবরীয় দলিলে (প্রদঃঘ) এবং মোঃ আমজাদ খান দত্তীয় সিসেস রাবেয়া রশিদ গং বরাবরীয় দলিল ৩ টি তে (প্রদঃ ঞ/১, ঞ/২) কেবল মাত্র সিএস/এসএ ২৯৮নং দাগ উলেস্নখ করা হয়েছে এবং উক্ত দলিল সমুহে আর. এস. দাগ উলেস্নখ করা হয়নি। সেÿÿত্রে মমির উদ্দিন মুন্সির নামীয় আর. এস. রেকর্ডের ভুমি কিসের ভিত্তিতে মিসেস রাবেয়া রশিদ গং বরাবর কিংবা ১-৩ নং বিবাদীদের বরাবর নাম খারিজ করা হয়েছে তার কোন যৌক্তিক ব্যাখ্যা বিবাদী পÿÿর লিখিত জবাবে নেই। সমির উদ্দিন মুন্সির নামীয় আর. এস রেকর্ড যথাযথ ভাবে চ্যালেন্স না করে ১-৩ নং বিবাদীদের নামে বা তাদের পুর্ববর্তীদের নামে উক্ত আর. এস. রেকর্ড নার খারিজ করা বিধি সম্মত হয়ণি মর্মেই প্রতীযমান হয়।’’</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It is apparent from the said finding, made by the trial Court that the the defendant respondents without challenging the record of right of Momiruddin Munshi, the predecessor of the plaintiff, could not Mutate their name in accordance with law. This assertion of the trial Court goes in favour of the plaintiff-appellant at this stage whereas he dismissed the suit without stating reason therein and thereby not sustainable by this Court. If so required they (defendants) ought to have corrected the record of right. In the light of this proposition of law, it was held in the case of Abdul Hafez and another Vs. Lal Meah &amp; others reported in 38 D.L.R. (1986) 327 and Akrab Ali and others Vs. Zahiruddin Kari and others reported in 30 D.L.R. (SC) (1978) 81 that according to section 103 B(5) of the Bengal Tenancy Act every entry in the record of right finally published shall be evidence of the matter referred to in such entry and shall be presumed to be correct until it is proved to be incorrect. It is further revealed from the impugned Judgment that the learned Joint District Judge after perusal of evidence on record could not be able to take a proper decision as to whether the suit brought by the plaintiff was proved by adducing evidence on record or not. From a close scrutiny of deposition of witnesses and other relevant documents, marked as exhibits, we find that the appellant as plaintiff after purchasing the suit land from the original owners, took over possession of the same and constructed boundary wall and encircled by fencing of barbed wire and built a tin shed house over the suit land. On perusal of evidence on record we have noticed further that the said tin shed house was built 5/6 months before holding local inspection on 13.09.2007 which has supported the case of the plaintiff to the effect that the defendant respondents purchased the suit land as alleged on 5.07.2007 after constructing wall and tin shed-house over the suit land as alleged on 5.07.2007 after constructing wall and tin shed-house over the suit land by the plaintiff-appellant.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have further carefully gone through the impugned Judgment wherefrom we find that the trial Court made such remarks which reads as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         <strong>“</strong><strong>৯২৪০ নং দলিলটি দেখা যায় যে, উক্ত দিলিল দ্বারা নালিশী সাবেক ২৯৮ নং দাগের ৪৬৫ শাতাংশ সম্পত্তির কাতে ০.৬৮ শতাংশ সম্পত্তি বিক্রি করা হয়। তবে এস. এ. ১২৪ নং খতিয়ানে উলেস্নখিত সোনা উলস্নাহ ও অহিদ আলীদের পিতার নামের সাথে সাথে দলিলে উলেস্নখিত অহিদ লালী ও সোনা উলস্নাহর পিতার নাম ভিন্ন রম্নপ দেখা যায়।’’</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">This finding of the Trial Court as well as evidence has made it clear that the record of ritht of Ahid Ali and sonaullah was defective which also goes against them (defendants) while in favour of the plaintiff appellant.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the discussion made above and submissions placed by the learned Advocate for the appellant to the effect that the plaintiff has been able to establish his right title as well as possession over the suit land both by adducing oral and documentary evidence and the other submissions made by the learned advocate for the respondents could not over come the case of plaintiff therefore, not accepted. And after having gone through the evidence and other materials on record we find that the decision of the trial Court calls for interference by this Court, be that as it may in view of what has been stated above, we find substance in this appeal. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed without any order as to costs and the Judgment and decree dated 16.6.2003 is hereby set aside and the suit is decreed as prayed for.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The connected Rule being Civil Rule No. 520 (F)/2009 stands disposed of accordingly.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Sent down the lower Courts record along with a Copy of this Judgment to the Court below, at once.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div>

He submits that the petitioner was not given any opportunity of being heard before going for such a serious action. He drew our attention to the Impugned Notice i.e. Annexure-C of the Writ Petition. He particularly drew our attention to the fact that while the said Impugned Order being Notice dated 12.11.2014 passed by the Respondent No.3 informing him that his BIN has been locked, no Show Cause notice was ever issued prior to such Notice. He also draws our attention to the fact that if at all any prior notice was ever issued in the context, the number including the details of the notices <strong>are</strong> registered under would be mentioned in the upper part of the Order. The Learned Advocate assails that from the Impugned Order itself it is quite apparent that no show cause notice was served upon him and nowhere in the Impugned Notice is there any reference to any prior notice. He concludes that ,therefore, withholding and locking his BIN without issuing any show cause or any other demand is in utter disregard and in violation of the principles of  Natural Justice guaranteed  under Article 102 of the constitution and is also violative of the statutory provisions of section 55of the VAT Act, 1991.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Moniruzzaman, the Learned DAG on the other hand opposes the Rule by filing an Affidavit-in-Opposition on behalf of the respondent no.3. He submits that the petitioner obtained Bond facilities for manufacturing garments accessories to supply the same to 100% export-oriented Industries, but after releasing some of the consignments under bond facilities the petitioner without in-bonding those  goods in violation of provisions of law sold the same in the local market .The Customs authority found shortage of 4030 bags of raw materials from the petitioner’s warehouse .The learned DAG assails that Tax Evasion Case No. 12 of 2014 dated 15.07.2014 was filed by the Customs Authority against the petitioner and issued demand cum show-cause notice upon the petitioner on 30.09.2014 requesting to pay government revenue to the tune of Tk. 40,59,096.00 immediately. The learned DAG in support of his assertion attracts our attention to the photocopies of the said Tax Evasion Case, Statement of factory in-charge and demand notices which are marked as Annexures 1, 2 and 3 in the affidavit in opposition.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the learned Advocates from both sides, examined the documents and the other materials on record. Upon scrutiny of the documents placed by the Learned DAG in support of his submissions, we are constrained to hold that the learned DAG’s submissions are not tenable and acceptable in the instant case, given that,  as is apparent from the records placed before us we have not found anything that might even indicate or imply that  any of the 3 (three) notices and documents relate to the consignment concerned in the present Writ Petition , against which  consignment non- payment of dues to the authority have given rise to the Impugned Order Locking the Petitioner’s BIN. Though the Learned DAG has tried to impress upon us all the documents he has shown,  particularly the Notice dated 30.09.2014 i.e. Annexure-1 of the Affidavit-In-Opposition and tried to persuade that the documents have a direct bearing with the impugned BIN locking notice issued upon the petitioner dated 12.11.2014, but in the light of the fact and circumstances, considering, that we have not found any such indication or implication from the records before us that the Annexures he has drawn our attention to, are in any manner connected to the consignment related to the Impugned Order, as such we are of the opinion that the Impugned Notice is not in keeping with the relevant provisions of law, namely Sections 55 &amp; 56 of the VAT Act,1991.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Bahadur Shah while making his submissions on behalf of the petitioner had taken us through the Impugned Order where he points out that there is no mention of any (myÎ) which in English generally means “connection or link” and which “myÎ” should normally precede before issuing any Notice of the sort impugned in the Writ Petition. He argues that said mention of any (myÎ) being absent in the Impugned Notice, is proof enough that no prior Show-Cause or any other Notice was ever issued to the Petitioner in this context. We are in full agreement with the submissions and the reasoning put forward by the Learned Advocate for the petitioner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There is another point stated and alleged in Paragraph-4 of the Affidavit-In-Opposition and which the Learned DAG while making his submissions also tried to assail is that the petitioner had released some consignments under Bond facilities from the Chittagong Customs House but that without In-bonding the same in the office of the Respondents, the Petitioner had sold the goods in the local market.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now, an allegation of this nature, if established amounts to a violation of Section 97 of the Customs Act, 1969. In pursuance of such an allegation we thoroughly scrutinized the records and which has led us to the Impugned Notice i.e. Annexure-‘C’ of the Writ Petition. We have read the notice, but contrary to the averments of the Learned DAG we have found that no allegation of this nature is mentioned anywhere in the said notice nor could the Respondents show us anything else from the records which could support their claim. Rather it is only stated in the Impugned Notice that “<strong><u>নিম্নে ছকে বর্ণিত বন্ডেড প্রতিষ্ঠানটির কার্যক্রম অতি ঝুঁকিপূর্ণ হওয়ায় সরকারী রাজস্বের স্বার্থে ও প্রতিষ্ঠানের নামে আমদানি রোধকল্পে সাময়িকভাবে প্রতিষ্ঠানটির</u></strong><u> Bin Lock </u><strong><u>রাখার জন্য অনুরোধ করা হলো</u></strong>”  The Respondents only mentioned in the Impugned Notice that the activities of the Petitioner is ‘<strong>ঝুকিপূণ</strong><strong>©</strong>’,  the word ‘<strong>ঝুকিপূণ</strong><strong>©</strong>’ in English generally means “hazardous” or “risky”. But the Respondents have omitted to state anything about the selling of the goods in open market as alleged by them and which the Learned DAG tenaciously tried to impress upon us in the Affidavit-in-Opposition, but they have not been able to satisfy us as to what led them to the conclusion that the activities of the petitioner is hazardous or risky ‘<strong>SzwKc~Y©</strong>’ ,and, therefore , such an offhand statement without explaining any reasons for their belief is unacceptable and cannot be sustained in law and we must ignore such allegations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now let us look into the relevant statutory provisions from VAT Act,1991 and which is reproduced below :-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>৫৫। অনাদায়ী ও কম পরিশোধিত মূল্য সংযোজন করসহ অন্যান্য [শুল্ক ও কর]  আদায়]।-(১) যেক্ষেত্রে কোনো নিবন্ধিত বা নিবন্ধনযোগ্য ব্যক্তি বা টার্নওবার কর এর আওতায় তালিকাভুক্ত বা তালিকাভুক্তির যোগ্য ব্যক্তি, তদকর্তৃক ধারা ৩৭ এর উপ-ধারা(২) এ বর্ণিত এক বা একাধিক [অপরাধ সংঘটনের] কারণে অথবা ভুলবশত : বা ভুল ব্যাখ্যার কারণে, সরবরাহকৃত পণ্য বা প্রদত্ত সেবার উপর প্রদেয়-</strong><br/><strong>ক. . . . . . . . . . . . . ঘ (২)</strong><br/><strong>(৩) উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন শুল্ক ও কর প্রদানের জন্য যেই ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে দাবী করা হয় সেই ব্যক্তি উক্ত উপ-ধারার অধীন কারণ দর্শানো নোটিশে উল্লিখিত সময় সীমার মধ্যে লিখিতভাবে উক্ত দাবীর বিরুদ্ধে আপত্তি উত্থাপন করিলে তাহাকে শুনানির সুযোগদান করিতে হইবে ; অতঃপর উক্ত ব্যক্তির উত্থাপিত আপত্তি বিবেচনা করিয়া সংশ্লিষ্ট মূল্য সংযোজন কর কর্মকর্তা উক্ত আপত্তি দাখিলের [১২০ (একশত বিশ) দিনের] মধ্যে বা কোন আপত্তি দাখিল করা না হইলে উক্ত উপ-ধারার অধীন নোটিশ জারীর তারিখের ১২০ (একশত বিশ) দিনের মধ্যে নোটিশে দাবীকৃত শুল্ক ও করের পরিমাণ, প্রয়োজনবোধে, পুনঃনির্ধারণক্রমে চূড়ান্ত করিতে পারিবেন, এবং উক্ত ব্যক্তি নোটিশে দাবীকৃত বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, পুনঃনির্ধারিত শুল্ক ও কর পরিশোধ করিতে বাধ্য থাকিবেন।]</strong><br/><strong>৫৬। সরকারের পাওনা আদায়।- (১) যেক্ষেত্রে কোনা ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে ধার্যকৃত কোন মুল্য সংযোজন করা বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, মূল্য সংযোজন কর ও সম্পূরক শুল্ক কিংবা আরোপিত কোন অর্থদন্ড কিংবা এই আইনের বা কোন বিধির অধীন সম্পাদিত কোন মুচলেকা বা অন্য কোন দলিলের অধীনে দাবীকৃত কোন অর্থ প্রাপ্য থাকে সেক্ষেত্রে (সহকারী কমিশনার পদমর্যাদার নিম্নে নহেন এমন কোন মূল্য সংযোজন কর কর্মকর্তা বিধিদ্বারা নির্ধারিত পদ্ধতিতে</strong><strong>)-</strong><br/><strong>ক). . . . . . . . . . . . ছ)</strong><br/><strong>[(১ক) কোন ব্যক্তির নিকট হইতে উপ-ধারা (১) এ বর্ণিত পাওনা সম্পূর্ণরূপে আদায় না হওয়া পর্যন্ত বা উক্তরূপ পাওনার আইনানুগ নিস্পত্তি না হওয়া পর্যন্ত, সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্মকর্তা উক্ত ব্যক্তির নিবন্ধনপত্রের কার্যকারিতা স্থগিত রাখিতে পারিবেন এবং সমুদ্র বন্দর, বিমান বন্দর, অন্য কোন শুল্ক স্টেশন অথবা শুল্কাধীন পণ্যাগারে রক্ষিত সেই ব্যক্তির মালিকানাধীন কোন পণ্যের খালাস কার্যক্রম বন্ধ রাখার জন্য সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্তৃপক্ষকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করিতে পারিবেন।</strong><br/><strong>ব্যাখা : এই উপ-ধারায় ‘‘নিবন্ধনপত্রের কার্যকারিতা স্থগিত’’ অর্থে কম্পিউটারাইজড বিল অব এন্ট্রি প্রসেসিং সিস্টেম মূল্য সংযোজন কর নিবন্ধন নমবর</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>BIN</strong><strong>) </strong><strong>বন্ধ</strong><strong> (</strong><strong>Lock</strong><strong>) </strong><strong>করিয়া রাখাও অন্তর্ভুক্ত হইবে</strong><strong>|]</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">From a close reading of both sections 55 and 56 of the VAT Act, 1991, it is clear that section 56 of the VAT Act, 1991 only sets out different modes of realizing the dues that may be owed to the Government by any person at a given time. Those dues could be the determined or ascertained amount of VAT or supplementary duties or it could be any penalty imposed upon any person from whom those may be due or the basis of any undertaking or bond “<strong>মুচলেকা</strong><strong>”</strong>  executed under this Act or any other law or by virtue of any demanded amount under any other deed or document that may be due from any person. As we already stated above, Section 56 only sets out the modes of realization of the dues from any person and such modes of realization are to be determined by Rules made in that behalf and the relevant corresponding rules to be followed when realizing dues under Section 56 of VAT Act,1991 is Rule 43 of the VAT Rules 1991 where the rules to be followed in realizing dues is clearly set out.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">But Section 56 cannot be construed or interpreted in an isolated manner. Section 55 and 56 must be read together and from a perusal of the same, it is evident that Section 56 is mandatorily preceded by Section 55 of the VAT Act,1991 which prescribes the issuance of a Show- Cause Notice followed by other procedures and which is exhaustively laid out in the whole Section. The prescription said out in Section 55(1) (2)(3) are mandatory and no action or initiative can be taken or resorted to for realization of any unpaid, less paid or otherwise evaded etc amount, whatsoever under the provisions of Section 56 of the VAT Act, 1991, unless and until firstly the procedure laid out in Section 55 of the VAT Act has been exhausted by the authorities concerned. The principle of law is that Section 56 automatically presupposes a notice under section 55(1) of the Act, followed by the procedure laid out in Sub-section 2 &amp; 3 of the said section 55 and which the respondents cannot avoid under any circumstances. The procedure in Section 55 (2) (3) must be at first complied with before proceeding to Section-56. But we regret to say that in the case before us, as is apparent from the records and the submissions made by both sides, the Respondents did not comply with the statutory provisions as set out in the VAT Act,1991 and did not issue any notice to the petitioner prior to the Impugned Notice that is Annexure-C of the Writ Petition and have thereby transgressed the provisions of the statute in flagrant violation of the law leading to infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In support of our findings in the present case, we have upon a research in to the common laws come upon a decision of this Court in the case of Diamond Steel Products Co. -Vs- Customs reported in 11 BLC (2006) where the principle of law enunciated therein is very much relevant to the context of the case we are dealing with at present and which is reproduced below.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Value Added Tax Act (XXII of 1991)<br/>Section 55 and 56<br/>“The admitted position is that in issuing both the impugned demands neither the respondent No.1 nor the respondent No.2 did care to follow the provision of sub-section (1)” of section 55 of the VAT Act and without issuance of any show cause notice they have straightaway made the demand without giving any opportunity of being heard to the petitioner and also without passing any adjudication order. The demands in question appear to have been issued pursuant to the provision of section 56 of the Act but the respondent cannot resort to section 56 of the Act without complying with the provisions of section 55. Therefore, it appears that in issuing the impugned demands the respondents have acted illegally and beyond their jurisdiction and the demands therefore, do not withstand the scrutiny of law. Thus the demands are liable to be struck down as being illegal and without jurisdiction.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Under the facts and circumstances, our considered view is that issuing the notice, only directly informing the petitioner that his BIN has been locked temporarily without any prior Show-Cause or demand Notice is absolutely violative of the principles of Natural Justice granted under the constitution and is violative of his statutory rights prescribed under Section 55 of the Act.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, we find merits in the Rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to costs. The notice impugned against is declared to have been made without lawful authority having no legal effect and hereby set aside.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the office of the Commission, Custom Bond Commissionerat, for future reference and guidance.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Harun-Ar-Rashid, Advocate, instructed by Syed Mahbubar Rahman, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><strong>For Respondents: </strong>Not represented<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Md. Abdul Wahhab Miah. J:</u></strong> This petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the judgment and order dated the 12th day of June, 2012  passed by a learned Judge of the Single Bench of the High Court  Division in Civil Revision No.700 of 2005 discharging the Rule.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Facts necessary to dispose this petition are that respondent No.1  as the plaintiff filed Title Suit No.284 of 2000 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Dohar for declaration of title and for recovery of khas  possession. Subsequently, the suit being transferred to the Court of Assistant Judge, First Court, Dhaka was renumbered as Title Suit No.400 of 1997.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the suit the petitioner herein was defendant No. I. Eventually, the suit was decreed exparte on 03.09.2002. The plaintiff levied Title Execution Case No.5 of 2002 for execution of the decree and pursuant to the decree, he was put into possession of the suit land. Thereafter the defendant filed an application before the Executing Court under section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) on 01.03.2004 with the prayer to put him into possession of the suit land on the ground that the suit land on the ground that the plaintiff obtained the decree by practicing fraud. The Executing Court by its order dated 03.10.2004 rejected the application.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Against the order of the Executing Court, the defendant filed Civil Revision No.302 of 2004 before the District Judge, Dhaka under section 115(2) of the Code. The learned District Judge, Dhaka summarily rejected the same on 03.10.2004. Against the order of the learned District Judge, the defendant filed Civil Revision No.700 of 2005 before the High Court Division under section 115(4) of the Code and obtained a Rule. A learned Judge of the Single Bench by the impugned judgment and order discharged the Rule; hence this petition for leave to appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During hearing of the petition, it transpired that against the exparte decree the decree the defendant had filed Title Appeal No.619 of 2002 before the District Judge, Dhaka and eventually the appeal was dismissed. Thus it is clear that the exparte decree is still in force.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Harun-Ar-Rashid, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner has argued that since the exparte decree was obtained by practising fraud. The executing Court had power to put back the defendant int possession of the suit land. We cannot accept the submission of Mr. Harun-Ar-Rashid for the simple reason that rightly or wrongly so long the decree remains that cannot be nullified or set at naught by putting the defendant into possession of the suit land which the plaintiff got through the due process of law in execution of the decree passed in the suit. We are of the view that If the defendant succeeds to set aside the exparte decree he would not be without any remedy and he shall be surely entitled to restitution of possession of the suit land under section 144 of the Code. Mr. Harun-Ar-Rashid has referred to some decisions in which the High Court Division and this Court as well interfered on the ground of fraud under section 151 of the Code. It does not require any elaboration for the proposition that If fraud is detected Court can always act under section 151 of the Code, but when the decree passed in a suit or a case is in existence no relief can be given to the defendant by way of restitution or restoration of possession of the suit land wherein the plaintiff was put in the possession through due process of law. We would like to observe further that since the appeal has been dismissed, the remedy of the defendant is to file revision application before the High Court Division.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">With above observation this petition is dismissed.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div> <hr/><div id="ftn1"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong><u>Civil Petition For Leave To Appeal No.</u></strong></a><strong><u> 3039 Of 2012 </u></strong><br/>(From the judgment and order dated 12<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> June, 2012 passed by the High Court Division in Civil Revision No.700 of 2005).</div></div></div></div>

Deb Choudhury, J:</u></em></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">This first miscellaneous appeal was filed against the judgment and order dated 02.11.2015 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, First Court, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 984 of 2014, rejecting an application for temporary injunction.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The appellant as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 984 of 2014 on 28.10.2014 before the learned Joint District Judge, First Court, Dhaka, for declaration of title and declaration that the present revisional record of rights are wrong and for staying the proceeding of Miscellaneous Case Nos. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014, pending before the Assistant Commissioner (Land) Gulshan Circle, Dhaka, the defendant-respondent No. 10.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Plaintiff’s case as stated in the plaint in short, is that, 164 decimals land of C.S. Plot No. 130 under C.S. Khatian No. 13 originally belonged to Jamir Bhuiyan, Kadam Bhuiyan and Jabu in 4 annas share each and Sayed Bhuiyan and Hayed Bhuiyan in 2 annas share each and C.S., S.A. and R.S. record of rights were duly prepared. Sayed Bhuiyan while in possession of his 21.05 decimals of land also purchased 20.5 decimals from Abu Bhuiyan, son of C.S. tenant Jamir Bhuiyan and 5 decimals from another co-sharer Hayed Bhuiyan by registered kabala dated 16.03.1944 and thus became owner of total 47 decimals. Sayed Bhuiyan sold 17.5 decimals and 24.75 decimals by two registered kabalas dated 26.02.1964 and 27.01.1967 respectively and 4.75 decimals remained with him. Sayed Bhuiyan died leaving behind 3 sons namely Asan Uddin, Basir Uddin alias Kerali and Rustom Ali and a daughter Saleman Nessa. Rustom Ali sold his entire share to his brother Asan Uddin by registered kabala dated 26.10.1978. Asan Uddin also purchased 16 decimals, 20 decimals and 17 decimals from his co-sharers by three separate registered deeds dated 07.02.1973, 05.07.1986 and 25.07.1996 respectively. By that way Asan Uddin became the owner of total 63.10 decimals of land by way of inheritance and purchase. Asan Uddin died leaving behind 6 sons namely Miaz Uddin, Yar Uddin, Saiz Uddin, Taiz Uddin, Azim Udin and Laiz Uddin. Thereafter they sold the suit land to Saidur Rahman Dipu and Mafizul Islam by registered Kabala dated 08.11.2009 who subsequently sold the suit land to the plaintiff through their constituted attorney by registered kabala dated 25.07.2010.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The further case of the plaintiff is that, after purchase, the plaintiff constructed a boundary wall and possessing the same by mutating his name vide Mutation Case No. 3821 of 2010-2011 and on payment of rent to the Government. The vendors of the plaintiff also paid rent to the Government by mutating their names. The defendant No. 1 filed Miscellaneous Case No. 97 of 2014 and the defendant Nos. 1-9 jointly filed Miscellaneous Case No. 115 of 2014 before the Assistant Commissioner (Land), Gulshan Circle, Dhaka for cancellation of the mutation of the plaintiff.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After filing of the suit, the plaintiff filed an application under Order 39 rule 1 and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure and prayed for an order of temporary injunction against the defendants to restrain them from entering into the suit land forcefully and from destroying the boundary wall of the petitioner along with an order of stay of further proceeding of Miscellaneous Case No. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014. On 28.10.2014 the Trial Court issued show cause notice along with an ad-interim order of injunction in the following terms:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>ইতিমধ্যে আগামী ধার্য্য তারিখ পর্যমত বিবাদীগণ যাহাতে জোর পূর্বক নালিশী সম্পত্তিতে প্রবেশ করিতে না পারে বা দখল করিতে না পারে বা তপছিল বর্ণিত সম্পত্তির কোন রকম পরিবর্তন করিতে না পারে এবং সহকারী কমিশনার ভূমি, গুলশান সার্কেল এ চলমান মিস কেস নং- ৯৭/১৪ এবং ১১৫/১৪ এর কার্যত্রুম গ্রহণ করিতে না পারে তৎমর্মে বিবাদীগনকে অমতবর্তীকালীন আদেশ দ্বারা বারিত করা হইল।</strong><strong>”</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Which remains in force till 21.05.2015, while the application for extension of the same filed under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure was rejected on the ground that, there is no scope for any extension, if the party, whose favour ad-interim order was passed, prays for any adjournment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The defendant Nos. 1-9 filed written statement on 09.06.2015 and also filed written objection against the prayer for temporary injunction on the same date on stating that the plaintiff on creating false documents trying to grab the suit land and also got the mutation of the record of rights beyond the knowledge of the defendants. The present City Khatian also stood in the name of the defendant Nos. 1-9 concerning 1864 decimals of land against which the plaintiff’s vendors filed Land Survey Case No. 1111 of 2008 before the Land Survey Tribunal, Dhaka against the defendants, which is still pending. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">By the impugned order dated 02.11.2015 the Trial Court rejected the application for temporary injunction mainly on the reasoning that without taking evidence the question of possession cannot be decided.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved the plaintiff-appellant preferred the instant First Miscellaneous Appeal and the same was admitted on 24.11.2015. After admission filed an application for stay of further proceeding of Miscellaneous Case No. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014, pending before the defendant-respondent No. 10 and also prays for an order of status-quo in respect of possession and position of the suit property and after hearing a Division Bench passed an ad-interim order, which is as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>Heard the learned Advocate and perused the application, considering the facts and circumstances the application is allowed. Let all further proceeding of Miscellaneous Case Nos. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014, now pending before the defendant opposite party No. 10 be stayed and the parties are directed to maintain status-quo in respect of possession and position of the suit property till disposal of the appeal.</em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Ali Imam Khaled Rahim, the learned advocate appearing for the plaintiff-appellant submits that the Trial Court while rejecting the application for temporary injunction failed to consider that the plaintiff is in possession of the suit land by constructing boundary wall and the defendant Nos. 1-9 trying to enter into the suit land forcefully and unless an order of temporary injunction is passed, the defendants will dispossess the plaintiff, which will render multiplicity of proceedings. He next submits that in the proceedings before the defendant-respondent No. 10 being Miscellaneous Case No. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014 are related to selfsame property and the fate of the said proceedings depends upon the result of the present suit and accordingly, the proceedings of Miscellaneous Case Nos. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014 are liable to be stayed till disposal of the suit. In support of his contention he relied upon two decisions, reported in 47 DLR (AD) 38 and 14 BLD (AD) 1 and accordingly, prays for allowing the appeal on allowing the application for temporary injunction as prayed for.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Mr. Md. Khalilur Rahman, the learned advocate appearing with Mr. Mohammad Babrul Amin, the learned advocate for the respondent Nos. 1-9 submits that so far the order of status-quo as passed by this Court on 24.11.2015, is concern, they have no objection, if the same is continued till disposal of the suit; but, so far the stay of further proceeding of Miscellaneous Case No. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014 pending before the defendant-respondent No. 10, submits that the said proceedings cannot be stayed by a civil court in view of Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in view of the provisions of Section 143 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. He next submits that the mutation proceeding being an independent proceeding and after disposal of the same there are independent forum for the aggrieved parties and as such the civil court has no jurisdiction to stay the further proceeding of the said miscellaneous cases. In support of his contention he relied upon some decisions, reported in 18 BLC 46, 6 BLC 241, 60 DLR (AD) 38 and 12 MLR (AD) 137.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the learned advocates for both the parties and perused the impugned judgment and order along with other annexures which were annexed with the applications.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have earlier mentioned that so far the order of status-quo is concern both the learned advocates for appellant and respondent Nos. 1-9 have no objection, if the same is continued till disposal of the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now the only consideration before this Court, whether the further proceedings of Miscellaneous Case Nos. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014, now pending before the defendant-respondent No. 10, Assistant Commissioner (Land) Gulshan Circle, Dhaka can be stayed by a civil Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears from the prayer of the plaint that the plaintiff not only prayed for declaration of title; but, also prayed for further declaration regarding the revisional record of rights and proceedings of Miscellaneous Case Nos. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that the contesting defendants filed an application before the Trial Court for rejection of plaint and the said application has been rejected by the Trial Court on 15.09.2015 and the defendants till today did not challenge the said order. It is settled principle of law that the record of rights are not a document of title and it is always subject to the result of a civil suit, where title is disputed. The revenue authority is bound to give effect of the ultimate decision of the civil court concerning any record of rights. In our view proceeding of a mutation case or a case concerning correction or cancellation of a record of rights will be a futile exercise, while a civil suit is pending concerning the land of that record of rights in between the parties thereto.  </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In appreciating the respective arguments we have considered the decisions referred by the learned advocate for the appellant.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that in the case of Syed Mohammad Salem Azam and others vs. The Secretary, Ministry of Works, Government of Bangladesh and others, reported in 47 DLR (AD) 38 our Hon’ble Appellate Division held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“We are not impressed by this argument. Respondent No. 1 had every jurisdiction to review its own order if the earlier order dated 08.08.1984 was obtained by the appellants by fraud and misrepresentation, but the impugned order on review must reveal what fraud and misrepresentation the appellants made or committed while obtaining the order dated 08.08.1984. The impugned order dated 08.11.1993 does not contain any indication to that effect. It simply says that the previous order dated 08.08.84 is cancelled. Furthermore, no indication has been given as to why criminal proceeding shall be instituted against the appellants for misappropriating Government property. What materials prompted respondent No. 1 to review its earlier order and what facts weighed upon him are simply absent in the impugned order. The impugned order is therefore not a speaking order and cannot be sustained. </em><br/><em>There is however a more fundamental objection to the impugned order. Respondent No. 4 has filed Title Suit No. 106 of 1984 for a declaration that the order dated 8.8.84 passed by respondent No. 1 is collusive and void and has amended the plaint for a further declaration that the appellants are not the son and daughter of the said Syed Mohammad Azam. The suit is still pending and respondent No. 1 is very much a party to the suit. Any decision taken by respondent No. 1 concerning the order dated 8.8.84 or any conclusion drawn by him regarding the death or otherwise of Syed Mohammad Azam during the pendency of the said title suit is an affront to a judicial proceeding and is an attempt to pre-empt a judgment. Respondent No. 4 being dissatisfied with the order dated 8.8.84 lodged a three-pronged attack on it by filing a case in the Court of Settlement, by filing a title suit and by making a representation to respondent No. 1. He lost the Settlement Court case, the title suit is pending and during the pendency of the title suit he obtained an order in his favour on those very matters which are the subject matter for trial in the title suit. His conduct too is not free from censure because it was at his instance that the impugned order dated 8.11.93 was passed. It was an unwarranted inroad into a judicial proceeding and cannot be condoned in any way.</em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">And in the case of Basarat Howlader, Secretary, Gutapara Matshajibi Samabay Samity Ltd. vs. Muramara Matshajibi Samabay Samity Ltd., reported in 14 BLD (AD) 1, their Lordships held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>Whether the order for enquiry was made before the issuance of the Rule Nisi or thereafter, it was absolutely improper on the part of the learned Advocate for the Writ petitioner-Respondents to pray for postponement of hearing “in order to afford the Government an opportunity of settling the dispute”, nor do we think it was proper for the Court to allow the Government “to decide the matter according to law” when the Court itself was in scission of the matter to do exactly the same. The Government is within its rights to conduct any number of internal inquiries into the disputed question of settlement, but as long as the legality or illegality of settlement is before the Court, the Government has no power to decide the issue this way or that way. It is for the Court to decide the matter. The Court cannot simply abandon its judicial responsibility in favour of the Government. It was open to the Writ-Petitioners to withdraw the writ petition and submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the Government, but it was not open to them to keep the writ petition pending and allow the Government to “decide the matter according to law”. In other words, the Writ petitioners cannot pursue two remedies at the same time, one at the Governmental level and the other in a Court of law, more so in the constitutional jurisdiction. The High Court Division also misjudge the submission of the learned Advocate for the Writ Petitioners and should not have acceded to his prayers. </em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Now let us examine the law and decisions as cited by the learned advocate for the respondents.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have gone through the Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The revenue authority cannot decide the title of the respective parties and it is only the civil court which can decide so and from that point of view Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not restricting power of a civil court in deciding title which will be reflected in the record of rights. Similarly Section 143 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 is also subject to decision of title by a civil Court. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In a case of Golden Re-Rolling Industries Ltd. vs. Subordinate Judge, Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka and another, reported in 60 DLR (AD) 38, our Apex Court held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>The High Court Division held that it is an established principle of law that where an alternative remedy exists a party cannot have recourse to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In this connection, the High Court Division relied on the case of Shahidur Rahman Majumder (Md) Shahidullah Majumder and others vs. Sahirunnesa and others reported in 1 BLC (AD) 43.</em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Fatema Khatun vs. Fazil Mia, reported in 6 BLC 241, a single Bench of the High Court Division held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>the recent record of right would prevail inasmuch as presumption attached to the State Acquisition record of right.” </em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Faizur Rahman (Md) and another vs. Md. Mokarram Hossain and others, reported in 18 BLC 46, a Division Bench of the High Court Division held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“the suit was filed without exhausting the procedure as laid down in section 147(c), as such, the suit is not maintainable.”</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">And in the case of Mr. Bazlur Rahman Sarker vs. Kamala Kanta Barman and another, reported in 12 MLR (AD) 137, our Hon’ble Appellate Division held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>On reading provision of Section 143 of the Act and the Rule 23(4) of the Tenancy Rule, 1955 we are of the view that the Revenue Officer in the facts and circumstances of the instant case in cancelling the mutation obtained by the plaintiff in respect of the land in suit was quite legal. It may be mentioned plaintiff got his name mutated upon sticking out name of Bipin Chandra who said to have acquired the land in suit by settlement from landlords, but in support of claim of settlement no evidence was brought on record. As stated hereinbefore the appellate Court set aside the judgment of the trial Court which dismissed the suit, primarily on the ground that revenue authority had no jurisdiction to correct the record of rights by cancelling the mutation earlier made in the name of the plaintiff on the view that the correction so made affected the right, title and interest of the person whose name was entered in the record of right upon mutation. In view of the provision of Section 143 of the Act and the Rule 23(4) of the Tenancy Rule, 1955 in our opinion the appellate Court was in serious error in setting aside the judgment of the trial Court on the view that the revenue officer had no jurisdiction to correct the record of rights prepared upon mutation in the name of the plaintiff.</em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">On going through the decisions cited by both the learned advocates for both sides it appears that none of the decision directly related with the issue before us. In the present case the only question before this Court is whether a civil court can stay the proceeding concerning record of rights pending before the revenue authority i.e. the Assistant Commissioner (Land) Gulshan Circle, Dhaka by way of temporary injunction. In a suit for declaration of title the civil court can decide both title and possession while the revenue authority only authorized to deal with the record of rights regarding amalgamation subdivision and consolidation of holdings as provided in Chapter XV of Part V of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. All the record of rights concerning which any dispute arise shall subject to decision regarding title by a civil Court apart from amalgamation, subdivision and consolidation of holdings as provided in Chapter XV of Part V of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950. In view of Section 54 of the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act the revenue officer is bound to carry on the final order or decree as passed by a civil court. This proposition has been settled in the case of Abdul Moin vs. Bangladesh represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Land, Secretariat Building and others, reported in 53 DLR 506, wherein a Division Bench of the High Court Division held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>When the matter was subsequently brought before the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) he was required in law to decide the matter either giving a decision instead of forwarding the same to the Ministry of Land by giving unwarranted and illegal observations. Since the question of title and possession have been settled by the highest Court of the country the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) had, in fact, no option in law but to mutate the name of the petitioner by correcting the record of right. The Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) not only acted without jurisdiction in sending the matter to the Ministry of Land without deciding the matter himself with untenable observations but also did so in colourable exercise of his official power. The impugned order dated 3-6-1998 passed by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Sylhet is therefore declared to have been passed without any lawful authority.</em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Though the learned advocates for both the parties failed to cite any decision on the point, of this Court or our Hon’ble Appellate Division; we considered an unreported decision passed in the case of Durgawati and another vs. Nan Bai and others, passed in Writ Petition No. 4933 of 2005 by the Chattisgarh High Court of India (collected from internet), wherein his Lordship held that,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<em>By this petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioners challenge the legality and validity of the order dated 29.07.2005 (Annexure P/7), passed by the IInd Additional District Judge, Ambikapur Distt. Surguja, in Misc. Civil Appeal No. 07/05 (Nan Bai Vs. Durgawati and others) whereby, the learned Additional District Judge directed the parties to maintain status quo in mutation proceedings with regard to plaint schedule ‘A’ land as obtained on 27.09.2004.</em><br/><em>I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties, perused the pleadings and documents appended thereto. It is evident that the mutation does not confer any right of the title or ownership. However, when admittedly there is a dispute with regard to title ownership of the land, it is proper that the proceedings before the Revenue Authorities must await the decision of the Civil Court in respect of the ownership right of the land in dispute. The judgment and order dated 15.02.2005 (Annexure P/5) passed by the Civil Judge, Class I, is without any basis and as such if the mutation proceedings is permitted to go on, there would be unnecessary multiplication of the disputes. Therefore, it is well settled that the civil court proceedings with regard to the same land must be given precedent. The appellate Court has rightly considered the dispute in its proper perspective and granted interim relief of status quo with regard to the mutation proceedings by the impugned order. There is no irregularity, illegality or perversity in the impugned order dated 29.07.2005 (Annexure P/7), passed by the IInd Additional District Judge, Ambikapur Distt. Surguja, in Miscs. Civil Appeal no. 07/05. </em>”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon considering the respective cases and the laws and decisions as stated above we are of the view that the civil court can restrain parties from proceeding with any case pending before a revenue authority. The mutation of record of rights does not confer any right title and interest over the concerned land, moreso, where there is dispute regarding title, Revenue authority should await till the result of the same by the civil Court. The proceeding before the Revenue authority if not maintain status-quo, then multiplicity of proceedings and conflicting decisions may arise and the proceedings of civil Court should be given precedent then the Revenue proceedings. In the present case though the application filed by the plaintiff-appellant for temporary injunction and stay is to some extend defective inasmuch as they could pray for restraining the defendant No. 10 from proceedings with the mutation proceedings instead of praying an order of stay. However, this is mere a technical defect which cannot disentitle the plaintiff from getting a substantial order.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, we find merit in the miscellaneous appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the first miscellaneous appeal is allowed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The application for temporary injunction is allowed in the form of status-quo, directing the plaintiff and the defendant-respondent Nos. 1-9 to maintain status-quo in respect of possession and position of the suit land and directing the defendant-respondent No. 10 also to maintain status-quo with regard to proceedings of Miscellaneous Case Nos. 97 of 2014 and 115 of 2014 pending before him, till disposal of the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Trial Court is hereby directed to dispose of the suit expeditiously preferably within 6(six) months from the date of receipt of this order.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">        Send a copy of this judgment to the court concern.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Since the above provision does not provide any consequence for non-compliance of the time-frame, its deviation is not to be considered to be too fatal to vitiate an execution process.

Rafiqul Islam Faruq Vs Bangladesh VIII ADC 439 that the date of publication of the notice as well as the date of holding the auction, both are to be included in computation of the 15 (fifteen) days’ time-frame.             . . .(16)</strong><br/><strong>Artha Rin Adalat Ain (VIII of 2003)</strong><br/><strong>Sections 15, 33(1) and 48</strong><br/><strong>The language employed in Section 48 of the Ain, 2003, ‘for computation of the days under this law’ (</strong><strong>এই আইনের অধীন দিবস গণনার ক্ষেএে</strong><strong>) and thereby generalising the method of counting the time-frame with reference to the judges’ working days does not fit in the functional aspect of the trial of a case which requires compliance by others also e.g. process server, nazarate, parties etc. If the <em>ratio</em> of the case of Md Rafiqul Islam Faruq Vs Government of Bangladesh reported in VIII ADC 439 is read in conjunction with the <em>ratio</em> laid down in the case of Peninsular Shipping Service Vs. Faruq paints 59 DLR (AD) 26, the inevitable conclusion at which anyone is led to arrive is that 15 (fifteen) days time, as provided in Section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003 means only 15 (fifteen) days, as opposed to 15 (working) days.                      . . .

Dhaka Pharmacy Limited, Md. Sharif (hereinafter referred to as respondent no. 6 or ‘the loanee’) availed a loan of Tk. 15,00,000/- (fifteen lac) from the IFIC Bank Limited (hereinafter referred to as ‘the IFIC Bank’) upon mortgaging a property, which is owned by these three writ petitioners and sold in the auction in question. On failure of the loanee to repay the said loan, the IFIC Bank instituted Artha Rin suit no. 119 of 2010 in the Adalat on 30.06.2010 against these three writ petitioners together with respondent nos. 4-6 for realization of the said loan and, eventually, an <em>exparte</em> judgment and decree was passed on 23.02.2011 for an amount of Tk. 16,44,707.54 along with  specified interest to be paid till the period of realization of the decretal amount. Thereafter, on 03.08.2011 the decree-holder (the IFIC Bank) filed Artha Jari Case no. 234 of 2011and an auction notice was published on 04.09.2012 in the Daily Protham Alo fixing 18.09.2012 for auction of the property. On 21.08.2011, the loanee filed an application with a prayer to allow three months time to adjust the decretal amount, but it was rejected by the Adalat. The auction was held on the said scheduled date and respondent no. 7 became the highest bidder with an offer of 61,00,000/- (sixty one lac) Taka and the Adalat accepted the same. Thereafter, on 24.09.2012 the present petitioners filed an application before the Adalat for withholding the auction process with a prayer to grant an opportunity to sell the property by themselves towards payment of the decretal amount, instead of selling out the mortgaged property through auction. On the same date the loanee also filed an application with a prayer to set aside the auction and allow one year time to adjust the decretal amount. However, the Adalat upon consideration of the statements and prayers of both the applications, rejected the same, against which the petitioner moved before this Court and obtained the instant Rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The IFIC Bank, which has been impleaded as respondent no. 3 in this case, contested the Rule by filing an affidavit-in-opposition contending, <em>inter-alia,</em> that on 03.08.2011the execution case was commenced by serving notices upon the loanee, the guarantor (loanee’s wife) and the petitioners (mortgagors) and, thereafter, on 21.08.2011 the loanee and his wife appeared before the Adalat with a prayer for 3 (three) months’ time in order to allow them to settle the claim amicably when the application was rejected. Thereafter, the loanee and the mortgagors did not take any step to pay the decretal amount, nor did they communicate with the bank and, eventually, the bank proceeded with the auction and, finally, the auction was held after nearly one year on 18.09.2012. It is contended that no illegality was committed in the execution process.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Md. Khalequezzaman Masud, the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner, places before us Section 33(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Ain, 2003’) and submits that the Adalat committed serious illegality by not complying with the said provisions in proceeding with the execution case inasmuch as the auction notice was published on 04.09.2012 and the auction was held on 18.09.2012 and, accordingly, it is his submission that the mandatory provisions of the Ain, 2003, as to giving at least 15 days’ time in between the date of publication of the auction notice and the date of auction sale, has been contravened. In an endeavour to reinforce his submission on this point, the learned Advocate places Section 48 of the Ain, 2003 before us and submits that in computing the 15 days’ time under the provisions of  Section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003, only the working days shall be counted and he, accordingly, argues that since it is evident that the date of publication of the auction notice is 04.09.2012 and the date of holding the auction was 18.09.2012, if two weekly holidays of 4 (four) days are deducted, in no way it becomes 15 (fifteen) days. He next submits that the property was sold at a shockingly low price at an amount of Tk. 61,00,000/- (sixty one lacs) as he claims that the market price of  the property is Tk.1.80 crore.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the issue of maintainability of this writ petition, the learned Advocate for the petitioner places before us the case of M/s. International Trade Promotors Vs. Artha Rin Adalat no. 1, Dhaka &amp; others, 17 BLT (AD) 306; Harun-or-Rashid Vs. Pubali Bank Limited and others, 12 MLR (AD) 343; Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited Vs. Alhaj Md. Shafiuddin Howlader and another reported in 5 MLR (AD) 191, and the case of Hosne Ara Begum and another Vs Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd, 5 MLR (AD) 290 and submits that since the order is ex-facie illegal, this Court is well empowered to entertain the present writ petition. On the point of maintainability of this writ petition, his concluding submission is that since the petitioners’ property is being taken away in breach of the provisions of law, the petitioners are competent to approach this Court to enforce their fundamental rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">By making the aforesaid submissions, the learned Advocate for the petitioners prays for making the Rule absolute.        </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Per contra, Mr. Ahasanul Karim, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the IFIC Bank, takes us through the order sheet of the Artha Jari Case no. 234 of 2011 and by specifically pin-pointing the order no. 02 dated 21.08.2011 in tandem with order no. 14 dated 18.09.2012 submits that the loanee and his wife appeared before the Adalat on 21.08.2011 and prayed for 3 months time for allowing them to pay the decretal amount and, thereafter, the auction was held on 18.09.2012 after allowing the loanee nearly one year, which is more than the time they had sought for arranging the sale of the mortgaged property privately. In elaborating his submission on this issue, he argues that within the aforesaid one year time, the loanee as well as the petitioners had the opportunity to settle the claim with the bank amicably, but they did not take any step towards settling the claim.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">With regard to the contention that the auction was held before completion of 15 working days as provided in Section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003, Mr. Karim refers to the case of Md. Rafiqul Islam Faruq Vs. Government of Bangladesh VIII ADC 439 and submits that the date of publication of auction notice on 04.09.2012 as well as the date of holding the auction are to be included within the said 15 (fifteen) days period of limitation, as stipulated in Section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003 and, thus, there was no deviation or contravention of any provisions of law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the petitioner side’s submission that the statutory period of 15 days should be counted upon excluding the weekly holidays and only the working days are to be computed, Mr. Karim refers to the case of Peninsular Shipping Service Vs. Faruq paint 59 DLR (AD) 26 and submits that provisions of Section 48 are applicable only for the purpose of counting the days in connection with trial of Artha Rin Cases, and not with execution cases. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">As to the issue of maintainability of the present writ petition, Mr.  Karim refers to a recent decision of a Division Bench of the High Court Division namely Sonali Bank Limited Vs Asha Tex International 20 BLC 185 and submits that all the post-decree stage orders are to be challenged by way of appeal by depositing 50% of the decretal amount, otherwise the provisions of the Ain, 2003 as a special law will be frustrated. The petitioners’ motive, he continues to submit, of dilly-dallying the execution process is clearly demonstrated and manifested from invocation of the writ jurisdiction purposefully and, also, from their conduct that after obtaining the stay order from this Court, they opted to kill further time.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In concluding his deliberations, he submits that grievance of the petitioners as to non-compliance of the provisions of Section 33(1) of the Ain is a mere device to halt the process of execution case. He submits that had this question been brought to the notice of the Adalat, the Bank might have agreed to call for a fresh auction and, thereby, proceeded towards an early disposal of the execution case. He frankly submits that all that the Bank expects is that the Artha Jari Case should be disposed of at the earliest possible time, either by making the present Rule absolute or by asking the Adalat for arranging fresh auction.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The added respondent no. 7 is the highest bidder and filed a Vokalatnama, but thereafter abstained from appearing before this Court. It is to be noted here that the petitioners, by filing a supplementary-affidavit, have alleged that the highest bidder is an Advocate by profession and is a practitioner of the concerned Artharin Adalat no. 3, Dhaka and, as an officer of the Court, he was not eligible to participate in the auction in question.           </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In adjudication of this case, we have allowed both the sides to make their submissions at length and, side by side, we have also perused the writ petition together with its annexures, affidavit-in-opposition and gone through the relevant laws and decisions placed before us very minutely.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that the core issues to be adjudicated upon by this Court are whether the Adalat has committed any illegality in selling out the mortgaged property by auction in the backdrop of the petitioners’ prayer for withholding the said auction, and also the issue of maintainability of the present writ petition, as raised by the learned Advocate for respondent no. 3. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is an admitted position that the auction notice was published on 03.08.2011 and the auction was held on 21.08.2011. It is the case of the petitioners that if the days are computed from the date of publication of the auction notice, from a simple calculation of the days, any one with ordinary prudence would come to a conclusion that only 13 days time has been given for selling the property on auction. In order to deal with the point, we should look at the provision of Section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003 which runs as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>৩৩z (১) অর্থ ঋণ আদালত ডিএ্রী বা আদেশ জারীর সময় কোন সম্পওি বিএ্রয়ের ক্ষেএে বাদীর খরচে বিজ্ঞপ্তি প্রচারের তারিখ  হইতে অন্যূন ১৫ (পনের) দিবসের সময় দিয়া সীলমোহরকৃত টেন্ডার আহবান করিবে, উও্র বিজ্ঞপ্তি কমপক্ষে বহুল প্রচারিত একটি বাংলা জাতীয় ~~দনিক পএিকায়, তদুপরি ন্যায় বিচারের স্বার্থে প্রয়োজন মনে করিলে Öহানীয় একটি পএিকায়, যদি থাকে, প্রকাশ করিবে; এবং আদালতের নোটিশ বোর্ডে লটকাইয়া ও Öহানীয় ভাবে ঢোল সহরত যোগেও উও্র বিজ·প্তি প্রচার করিবেz</strong><strong>”</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">From a plain reading of the above provisions, it is crystal clear that there should be a gap of 15 (fifteen) days’ time between the date of publication of the auction notice and the date of holding the auction. Since the above provision does not provide any consequence for non-compliance of the time-frame, its deviation is not to be considered to be too fatal to vitiate an execution process. All that the law contemplated is that there should be sufficient publicity of the proposed auction so that the maximum number of bidders could be invited for attending the auction. However, by applying the <em>dictum </em>laid down in the case of Md. Rafiqul Islam Faruq Vs Bangladesh, VIII ADC 439 that the date of publication of the notice as well as the date of holding the auction, both are to be included in computation of the 15 (fifteen) days’ time-frame, the calculation of days comes to clear 15 (fifteen) days. Thus, we do not find any substance in the submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioner that the provisions of Section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003 have been infringed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now, let us deal with the other count of submissions of the petitioners’ Advocate with reference to the provisions of Section 48 of the Ain, 2003, which according to him, requires 19 days time to be allowed by the Adalat, because another 4 days should be added with this 15 days by virtue of two weekly holidays for each week. For this, it would be profitable to look at the provisions of Section 48 of the Ain, 2003 which is reproduced below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>৪৮z <u>এই আইনের অধীন দিবস গণনার ক্ষে</u></strong><strong><u>­Î ‡KejgvÎwePvi‡Ki Kvh©w`em MYbv Kiv nB‡e</u></strong><strong> Ges mvgwqKfv‡e `vwqZ¡cÖvß wePvi‡Ki Kvh© w`emI A</strong><strong>নু</strong><strong>iƒ</strong><strong>প</strong> <strong>গণনার</strong> <strong>অ¿¹র্ভূও্র হইবেz (</strong>underlined by us<strong>)</strong><strong>”</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The above provisions usher a paradoxical proposition. Although it contains the words “<strong><u>এই আইনের অধীন</u></strong><strong> দিবস গণনার ক্ষে</strong><strong>­Î</strong>”; meaning in computation of the time under the provisions of this law, the expressions, “<strong>কেবলমা</strong><strong>Î</strong><strong> <u>বিচারকের কার্যদিবস</u> গণনা করা হইবে এবং সাময়িকভাবে দায়িত্বপ্রাপ্ত বিচারকের কার্য দিবসও অ</strong><strong>byiƒc</strong> <strong>MYbvi Aš—©f~³ nB‡e</strong>” makes the mode of computation of the days complicated.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon skimming through the entire Ain, 2003, we find that most of the provisions containing the time-frame to be followed at various stages of the suit have got no nexus with the ‘working days of the judge’ <strong>(বিচারকের কার্য দিবস</strong>). For example the time period spelt out in Section 7 of the Ain, 2003 is regarding service of notices, the time-frame prescribed in Sections 10 &amp; 11 of the said Ain, 2003 is with regard to  submissions of the Written Statement or Additional Written Statement, Section 16 of the Ain, 2003 prescribes the time-frame for pronouncement of judgment, Section 19  of the said Ain, 2003 provides limitation of time for filing application for setting aside the <em>exparte </em>decree, Section 22(5) &amp; (6) of the Ain, 2003 provides time-frame for dealing with mediation,  time limitation for filing execution case is given in Section 28 of the said Ain, 2003, time limitation for service of notice of execution is prescribed in Section  30 of the same law, time limit provided in Section 32 of the Ain, 2003 is for raising objection against execution case by the third parties, time-frame for auction  is outlined in Section 33 of the Ain, 2003, period of civil detention  has been provided in  Section 34 of the Ain, 2003, time limitation for preferring appeal is provided in Section 41 of the Ain, 2003. These provisions of time-frame under the Ain, 2003 are least connected with the working days of the judges, because in complying with those provisions the judge has very little to do except ensuring compliance by other functioneries.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Only the four provisions of the Ain, 2003, namely Sections 17, outlining the time frame for disposal of the Artharin Cases, Section 37, where time-frame is provided for disposal of Execution Cases, Section 41(6) which prescribes the time-frame for disposal of appeals and the time-frame for disposal of revision prescribed in Section 42(3) are directly connected with the working days of the judge (<strong>বিচারকের কার্যদিবস</strong>).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, the language employed in Section 48 of the Ain, 2003, ‘for computation of the days under this law’ (<strong>এই আইনের অধীন দিবস গণনার ক্ষেএে</strong>) and thereby generalising the method of counting the time-frame with reference to the judges’ working days does not fit in the functional aspect of the trial of a case which requires compliance by others also e.g. process server, nazarate, parties etc. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Peninsular Shipping Service Vs. Faruq Paint 59 DLR (AD) 26, the Apex Court, in an effort to make the said provisions of Section 48 of the Ain, 2003 workable, upon examining the provisions of the said Section 48 in detail propounded as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“----the provision in Section 48 of the Ain, 2003 is limited only to count the time for disposal of cases having no connection whatsoever with the period prescribed for filing appeal, nay of making deposit as required under section 41 of the Ain. The position shall be more clear if we read sections 45 to 46, prescribing various period as to filing/disposal of case in the aforesaid separate chapter i.e. Chapter VIII. In view of what has been stated above, we are of the view that, acceptance of the argument of the respondents that Section 48 is applicable in case of filing the appeal shall lead to a dangerous effect telling upon the legal jurisprudence of the country and such a view is therefore unwarranted”. </em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon applying the <em>ratio</em> of the case of Md Rafiqul Islam Faruq Vs Government of Bangladesh reported in VIII ADC 439 in conjunction with the <em>ratio</em> laid down in the case of Peninsular Shipping Service Vs. Faruq paint 59 DLR (AD) 26  in the present case, the inevitable conclusion at which we are led to arrive is that 15 (fifteen) days time, as provided in Section 33(1) of the Ain, 2003, was complied with and, thus, there is no illegality in the execution process of Artharin Jari Case no. 234 of 2011.  Accordingly, we hold that the impugned order dated 18.09.2012 passed by Artha Rin Adalat is fundamentally consistent with the statutory requirement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now, the question that comes up for consideration is whether the petitioners were competent to invoke the forum under Article 102 of the Constitution in the backdrop of operation of the provisions of Section 41 of the Ain, 2003. In order to examine the said issue, let us look at the provisions of Section 41 of the Ain, 2003, which are reproduced below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>৪১z (১) মামলার কোন পক্ষ, কোন অর্থ ঋণ আদালতের আদেশ বা ডিএ্রী দ্বারা সংক্ষুন্ড হইলে, যদি ডিএ্রীকৃত টাকার পরিমান ৫০(পথ·াশ) লক্ষ ঢ~াকা অপেক্ষা অধিক হয়, তাহা হইলে উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, পরবর্তী ৬০ (ষাট) দিবসের মধ্যে হাইকোর্ট বিভাগে, এবং যদি ডিএ্রিকৃত টাকার পরিমান ৫০ (পথ·াশ) লক্ষ ঢ~াকা অথবা তদঅপেক্ষা কম হয়, তাহা হইলে পরবর্তী ৩০ (এিশ) দিবসের মধ্যে জেলা জজ আদালতে আপীল করিতে পারিবেনz</strong><br/><strong>(২) আপীলকারী, ডিএ্রীত্র্রত টাকার পরিমাণের ৫০% এর সমপরিমান টাকা বাদীর দাবীর আংশিক স্বীকৃতিস্বর্রপ নগদ ডিএ্রীদার আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠিানে, অথবা বাদীর দাবী স্বীকার না করিলে, জামানত সর্রপ ডিএ্রী প্রদানকারী আদালতে জমা করিয়া উও্রর্রপ জমান প্রমাণ দরখাস¹ বা আপীলের মেমোর  সহিত আদালতে দাখিল না করিলে, উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন আপীল কার্যার্থে গৃহীত হইবে নাz</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Section 41 of the Ain, 2003 in an unambiguous term provides that if any party to the Artharin Case is aggrieved by an order or decree (“<strong>মামলার কোন পক্ষ, কোন অর্থঋণ অাদালতের  <u>আদেশ</u> বা <u>ডিএ্রি</u> দ্বারা সংক্ষুব্দ হইলে</strong>”), he may prefer an appeal upon depositing the 50% of the decretal amount.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Here in the case at hand, the petitioners have challenged the ‘order’ (<strong>Av‡`k</strong>) passed by the Adalat and, in line with the <em>ratio</em> laid down in the case of Sonali Bank Ltd Vs Asha Tex International 20 BLC 185, we hold that the impugned order being a post-decree one, the only path available for the petitioners is preferring an appeal before the competent Court. When a defendant of the Artharin suit wishes to challenge an order before pronouncement of the decree, he may be allowed to invoke the writ jurisdiction, for, he is unable to pay 50% of the decretal amount inasmuch as until a decree is drawn, he is not in a position to make an assessment of depositing the amount of 50% of the decretal amount. But after passing the decree, which is the fact in this case, an aggrieved defendant does not have any option other than preferring an appeal by depositing 50% of the decretal amount.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Here, the petitioners approached this Court by filing the instant writ petition, instead of preferring appeal. Their such move appears to us to be a tactic with an ulterior motive of avoiding the requirement of making 50% deposit of the decretal amount coupled with their intention of dragging this case for whatever the period it might take for disposal of this writ petition. Thus, we find that after pronouncement of the judgment and decree on 23.02.2011 by the Adalat in Artha Rin Case no. 119 of 2010,  invocation of the writ jurisdiction by the petitioners by circumventing  the statutory route of appeal is a mere device to dilly-dally the process of execution in an attempt to frustrate the Ain, 2003.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case at hand, the execution case was registered on 03.08.2011 and, thereafter, the notices were duly served upon the loanee and the other judgment-debtors namely, his wife, who is a party to the suit as the guarantor, and the present three petitioners as the mortgagors. Then, the loanee on 21.08.2011 appeared before the Adalat with a prayer for allowing him 3 (three) months time to enable him to settle the matter amicably. Although, the said prayer was rejected by the Adalat, the loanee and the petitioners had ample time in their hands to settle the matter with the bank in view of the fact that the auction was held on 18.09.2012, which is after a lapse of one year time from the date of the judgment-debtor’s prayer for giving an opportunity for amicable settlement. Thus, it is evident that the time, which was sought for by the loanee, initially for 3 (three) months and subsequently for one year, for amicable settlement towards adjustment of the decretal amount, has been enjoyed by the all the judgment-debtors, including these three petitioners, nevertheless, they failed to adjust the decretal amount. Although these 3 (three) petitioners have taken a plea that they were not aware of the auction notice, however, in the backdrop of the order recorded on 21.08.2011 by the Adalat that the notices were duly served upon all the parties, the plea taken by them appears to be implausible. Moreover, their appearance before the Adalat on 24.09.2012, being just after 5 (five) days of the holding of auction of the property on 18.09.2012, suggests that they had knowledge about the execution case and were in touch with the loanee who, after commencing the Execution Case, at first unsuccessfully sought for three months’ time and again on the 24.09.2012, concurrently with these three petitioners, prayed for one year time.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Even for the sake of argument, if it is considered that these 3 (three) petitioners were not aware of auction sale, however, after filing this writ petition on 01.03.2009 and upon obtaining an order of stay on the execution process, the petitioners could have taken necessary steps for adjustment of the decretal amount, but in the last more than 6 (six) years, they not only refrained from settlement of the claim with the IFIC Bank, they also did not bother to have this matter heard. Thus, from the conduct of these three petitioners, it is very much apparent that the only purpose of these three petitioners is to linger on the execution of the decree and thereby to abstain from making the payment towards the adjustment of the decretal amount. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The above conduct of the petitioners is further reflected at the hearing stage of this case. Order sheet shows that this matter was fixed at the instance of respondent no. 3, the IFIC Bank. When the matter was posted in the Cause List under the heading of “For Hearing” on consecutive days with the names of the learned Advocate for the petitioners, neither the petitioners nor their engaged Advocate appeared before this Court. It is only when the matter was taken up for passing the necessary orders due to non-appearance of the petitioners, the learned Advocate for these 3 (three) petitioners appeared before this Court and expressed their desire to conduct the hearing of this Rule and, accordingly, hearing took place.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate has referred to some case laws in support of his submission that an aggrieved party in a Artharin Case is well competent to invoke the writ jurisdiction. These cases are discussed below. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of M/S International Trade Promoters Vs Artharin Adalat 17 BLT (AD) 306, the mortgagor approached the writ Court when the Adalat sold the mortgaged property being a 5 storied building on 5 (five) Kathas land, situated at Indira Road, Dhaka, at a shockingly low price of 35 lacs only, the High Court Division disposed of the writ petition with a direction upon the Adalat to review its own order on auction sale by setting aside the same towards holding a fresh auction and refund the auction purchaser’s money with a compensation of 12% interest to be paid by the petitioners. Challenging the aforesaid order of the High Court Division, the auction purchaser when moved the Appellate Division, the order of the High Court Division was upheld. In this cited case, none of the sides had raised the question of maintainability of the writ petition and, thus, there was no examination of the said issue therein. Moreover, the petitioners of this case did not make out a case of selling out their property at a shockingly low price.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Harun-or-Rashid (Md) Vs Pubali Bank Ltd 12 MLR (AD) 343, when the writ petitioner challenged an interlocutory order of the Adalat at pre-decree stage, the High Court Division summarily rejected the writ petition on the ground that since there is bar to prefer an appeal against an interlocutory order, only revision under Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) could be filed. The Apex Court held that since there is no forum before passing the decree, a party aggrieved by any pre-decree stage order of the Adalat is competent to invoke Article 102 of the Constitution. In the case in our hand, we have taken the same view that while writ is the proper forum against an interlocutory order passed at pre-decree-stage, however, an appeal must be preferred against any order passed by the Adalat at post-decree phase.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Hosne Ara Begum Vs Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd 5 MLR (AD) 290 the question as to whether revision lies against an interlocutory order was settled by the Appellate Division in negative. In the said case, the date was fixed for judgment but the defendant wanted to recall the PW1 and the prayer was allowed fixing a date for further hearing.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd 5 MLR (AD) 191, when the bank’s application for restoration of the suit under Order 9, rule 9 of the CPC was allowed, the defendant challenged the order in the High Court Division invoking its revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the CPC. In this cited case, no issue was raised as to the maintainability of the application filed by the Bank for restoration and, thus, the Apex Court, for ends of justice, held that the order of restoration of the suit by the Adalat is an equitable one. Thus, the <em>ratio</em> of this case is not inconsistent with our view, for, we are also disposing of the Rule for ends of justice by which no party to the suit would adversely be affected. In fact, had we been of the view that the writ petitioners shall have to prefer appeal, they had to encounter two hurdles namely, depositing of 50% of the decretal amount and, secondly, they are out of time to prefer an appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">From the above discussions on the afore-cited case laws referred to by the learned Advocate for the petitioners, it appears that the <em>ratio</em> laid down therein are not applicable in this case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Adjudication of the instant Rule, however, would remain incomplete, if we become oblivious of the last count of submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioners on the maintainability issue. In a bid to fit in this writ petition within the purview of article 102 of the Constitution, it was submitted by the petitioners’ learned Advocate that since the petitioners are complaining before this Court as to violation of their fundamental right under Article 42 of the Constitution, the present writ petition is very much maintainable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this connection, this Court’s consistent view is that the said fundamental right is a qualified right, which may be enforced only subject to limitations imposed by laws. This point has been elaborately discussed and examined in the recent case of Concord Pragatee Consortium Ltd Vs BPDB 66 DLR 475. Since the Ain, 2003 empowers the bank to sell the mortgaged property for realization of their loan, the submission appears to us to be without any substance. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">It leads us to hold that the present writ petition is not maintainable for bypassing the forum provided in a special statute, namely Artharin Adalat Ain, 2003. Thus, the instant Rule is liable to be discharged on maintainability ground as well.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">This case appears to be a fit case for slapping costs upon the petitioner given the manner and style of handling this case by the loanee and these three petitioners, who are persistently trying to delay the disposal of the execution case by abusing the process of the Court, as discussed hereinbefore. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is discharged with a cost of Taka 10,000/- (Ten Thousand) to be paid by the petitioners in the national exchequer by way of submitting Treasury Challan within 30 (thirty) days. The order of stay granted at the time of issuance of the Rule is hereby vacated.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Artha Rin Adalat is directed to ensure the compliance of the above direction with regard to deposit of the above cost by the petitioner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Artha Rin Adalat shall dispose of the Artha Jari case in question expeditiously without allowing any undue adjournment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Office is directed to communicate this order to Artharin Adalat, Dhaka, 3 at once.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The office is further directed to send a copy of this judgment and order to the Law Commission of Bangladesh for its perusal so as to let them consider whether in the provision of Sections 15 of the Ain, 2003, the following type of words <strong>“</strong><strong>নিলাম নোটিশ প্রকাশের দিন এবং নিলাম অনুসঠানের দিন সহ পনের দিন</strong>” should be explicitly incorporated in the backdrop of judicial pronouncement by the Apex Court in the case of Peninsular Shipping Service Vs. Faruq paint 59 DLR (AD) 26 that in counting the 15 (fifteen) days’ time-frame, whether both the above-mentioned days are to be included and, also, to see whether the provisions of Section 48 of the said Ain, 2003 require to be expressed in a clearer manner.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div></div></div>

In fact, before he arrived at such decision, he should have taken specialist doctor’s opinion whether the accused was insane or not. It is said that the court is always expert of all experts but not always. In certain cases court should look for the expert opinion before giving its decision. Since the defence has been insisting right from the very beginning of the case that the accused is insane, the learned Sessions Judge should have obtained doctor’s opinion before forming his definite opinion as to the insanity of the accused. In such situation, the learned Sessions Judge should not have arrived at a decision on the basis of his unprofessional knowledge.         ...(90)</strong><br/><strong>Criminal Trial </strong><br/><strong>In the post mortem report it has been mentioned that the death was due to asphyxia following manual strangulation (throttling). But according to the confessional statement the cause of death was drowning. Therefore, we find that the confessional statement of the accused is not consistent with the prosecution case, the post mortem report and the inquest report. Another important point is required to be addressed here is that in the inquest report it has been stated that there was sign of burn on the person of the body of the deceased. But no where it has been stated in the post mortem report that there was sign of burn on the person of the body of the deceased. Again, the investigating officer (P.W. 15) has stated that on 06.08.2007, a G.D. Entry was lodged but he did not procure a copy of the G.D. Entry. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to show the result of the G. D. Entry. P.W. 4 who is the maternal grandfather of the deceased and the father of the informant stated that police arrested his two sons, namely, Ruhul and Reha in connection with the case. But they have not been made by accused in the case, even they have not been cited as witness in this case. The prosecution has not been able to prove the charge against the condemned prisoner beyond doubt. Therefore, the condemned prisoner is liable to be acquitted.       . . .

P. C) to this Court. The reference has been numbered as Death Reference No. 133 of 2008.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi found the condemned prisoner namely, Md. Sajjad Ali guilty of the charge under section 302 of the Penal Code and convicted and sentenced him thereunder to death in Sessions Case No. 609 0f 2008 arising out of M.G.R No. 690 of 2007, corresponding to Motihar P.S. Case. No. 03 dated 07.08.2007. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 01.12.2008 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi, the condemned prisoner Md. Sajjad Ali has filed Criminal Appeal No. 8657 of 2008 and Jail Appeal No. 30 of 2009 before this court. The Death Reference No. 133 of 2008, Criminal Appeal No. 8657 of 2008 and Jail Appeal No. 30 of 2009 have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution case, in short, is that the informant lodged an FIR with the Motihar Police Station, Rajshahi, alleging inter alia, that on 06.08.2007 at about 07.30 P.M. the sons of the informant, namely, Sohag (P.W. 2), Sohan and Shuvon @ Shuvo (deceased) were playing on the pucca road in front of the shop of Shafiqul (P.W. 8). At about 07.30 P.M, accused Md. Sajjad Ali called the younger son of the informant, namely, Shuvon with the promise to offer him biscuit and caught hold of his hand and went away towards Parila village in the north. The accused also told Sohag and Sohan to go home. Sohag (P.W. 2) and Sohan informed Shafiqul (P.W. 8), Md. Saiful (not examined), Md. Rezaul Islam (P.W. 11) and Md. Rubel Hossain (P.W. 12) that accused Md. Sajjad Ali took away Shuvon. Thereafter, at 8.00 P.M, Sohag and Sohan came home and narrated the whole incident to their mother (informant herein) and father. The informant and her husband also narrated the incident to Idris Ali, Member (P.W. 3). Thereafter, they went out and tried to find out Shuvon. On 7.08.2007, in the morning, the informant came to know that accused Md. Sajjad Ali was talking to 5/6 unknown persons standing on the road. The informant had strong suspicion that accused Md. Sajjad Ali kidnapped her son Shuvon with 5/6 unknown persons with a view to kill him. The informant made  a thorough search but did not find out Shuvon and lodged the F.I.R.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of the aforesaid F.I.R, Motihar Police Station Case No. 03 dated 07.08.2007 under sections 364A/302/201 of the Penal Code was recorded.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">S.I. Moktar Hossain was entrusted with the charge of investigation of the case. During investigation he visited the place of the occurrence, prepared the sketch map with separate index thereof, examined the witnesses and recorded their statements under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and finally submitted charge sheet No. 140 dated 13.09.2007 under sections 364A/302/201 of the Penal Code as a <em>primafacie </em>case was made out against the accused. Police arranged for recording the statements police also arranged recording of the witnesses, namely, Md. Idris Ali accused under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Sohag under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The record was transmitted to the Court of the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi for trial.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The case was numbered as Sessions Case No. 609 of 2007.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Sessions Judge framed charge against the accused under sections 302/201 of the Penal Code. The charge was read over and explained to the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In order to substantiate the charge against the condemned prisoner, the prosecution has examined as many as 15 witnesses in this case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After close of the recording of evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the accused was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This time also he repeated his innocence but did not adduce any D.W.        </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The defence case as it appears from the trend of cross-examination is that the accused is insane and he is incapable of making his defence and as such he is entitled to get the benefit of section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The further defence case is that the accused is innocent and he has falsely been implicated in this case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Considering the facts, circumstances of the case and the evidence on record, the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi convicted and sentenced the condemned prisoner as aforesaid.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 01.12.2008, the condemned prisoner has preferred Jail Appeal No. 30 of 2009 and Criminal Appeal No. 8657 of 2008.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Death Reference No. 133 of 2008, the Criminal Appeal No. 8657 of 2008 and in Jail Appeal No. 30 of 2009 have been heard together and being disposal of both common judgment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Md. Bashirullah, the learned Deputy Attorney General, Mian Md. Shamim Ahsan, the learned Assistant Attorney General and Ms. Yeadia Zaman, the learned Assistant Attorney General appearing on behalf of the State supported the death reference and opposed the criminal appeal No. 8657 of  2008 and jail appeal No. 30 of 2009. Dr. Md. Basir Ullah, the learned Deputy Attorney General first took us through the F.I.R, charge, evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the impugned judgment and order dated 01.12.2008, the confessional statement made by the condemned prisoner Md. Sajjad Ali, inquest report, post mortem report and other relevant papers available in the paper book. The learned D.A.G. then submits as under:	<ol><li>the prosecution has been able to prove the case against the condemned prisoner, Md. Sajjad Ali beyond all reasonable doubt and as such there is no good ground to interfere with the impugned judgment and order dated 01.12.2008 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi by this court at this stage;</li><li>the time of occurrence, place of occurrence and the manner of occurrence have been proved by the prosecution witnesses beyond doubt;</li><li>P.W. 2. Sohag, P.W. 11. Riazul Islam and P.W. 12. Md. Rubel Ali saw the condemned prisoner taking away the victim and that they also saw the accused last with the victim;</li><li>the condemned prisoner made an extra judicial confession and he admitted that he killed the victim Shuvon;</li><li>the condemned prisoner also made a judicial confession on 08.08.2007 and his  confession is voluntary and true;</li><li>on the pointing of the accused the dead body was recovered and this shows that the accused killed the deceased, Shuvon;</li><li>none of the prosecution witnesses stated that the accused appellant was insane and that the Magistrate at the time of recording confessional statement did not find any sign of insanity in the behavior of the accused;</li><li>the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi gave the definite finding that the accused was not insane;</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;">With these few words the learned D.A.G. prays for acceptance of the reference and dismissal of the Criminal Appeal and the Jail Appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In support of his submission, Dr. Md. Bashir Ullah, the learned Deputy Attorney General refers to the following cases:	<ol><li>Syed Nurul Azim Babar Vs the State, reported in 14 MLR (AD) 364;</li><li>the case of In Re Sankappa Shetty, reported in AIR 1941, Madras-326;</li><li>the case of Dahyabhai Vs The State of Guzarat, reported in AIR 1964, (SC) 1563;</li><li>the case of Mobarok Ali Vs Md.

Shahjahan, Mr. Md. Moniruzzaman and Mr. Md. Ashikur Reza Chowdhury, the learned Advocates appeared on behalf of the condemned prisoner, and they prayed for rejection of the death reference.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They also prayed for allowing the Criminal Appeal No. 8657 of 2008 and the Jail Appeal NO. 30 of 2009. However, Mr. S.M. Shahjahan, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the condemned prisoner submits as under:	<ol><li>there is no eye-witness in this case;</li><li>the highest sentence of death has been awarded to the condemned prisoner only on the basis of confession of the accused-appellant and that the confession is not consistent with the prosecution case and that the confessional statement of the condemned prisoner is not voluntary and true;</li><li>there is divergence between the nature of injuries mentioned in the inquest report and the post mortem report;</li><li>in the inquest report it has been stated that there is burn injury under the arm pit of the deceased but there is no mention of such injury in the post mortem report;</li><li>the accused is insane and that this matter was brought before the Magistrate on 02.09.2007 and that subsequently it was brought to the notice of the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi on 12.11.2007, 04.02.2008, 06.02.2008, but the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi did not take any step to ascertain whether the accused is insane or not;</li><li>according to section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when the matter of  insanity was brought to the notice of the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi, he was under legal obligation to ascertain whether the allegation of insanity was true or not before proceeding with the case;</li><li>the impugned judgment and order dated 01.12.2008 cannot sustain in law as the condemned prisoner was insane and incapable of taking his defence.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;">With these few words the learned Advocate for the condemned prisoner prays for rejection of the death reference and allowing the criminal appeal and the jail appeal.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">He, however, refers to the following cases:</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">the case of Wally Ahmed alias Babi Vs The State, reported in 58 DLR 433;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the case of Woolmington Vs Director of Public Prosecutors, All England Law Reports, reported  in 1935 A.C. 462;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the case of Nikhil Chandra Halder Vs The State, reported in 54 DLR 148;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">the case of Shama Tudu Vs The State, reported in 1987 Crl.

He, however, adopted the submissions of the learned Advocate Mr. S. M. Shahjahan and adds as under:	<ol><li>when the allegation of insanity was brought before the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi, he should have arranged examination of the condemned prisoner by a competent doctor to ascertain whether the accused was really insane or not;</li><li>the learned Sessions Judge abruptly came to the conclusion by his unprofessional knowledge that the condemned prisoner was not insane;</li><li>the confessional statement of the accused appellant runs counter to the prosecution case and that the confession it is not consistent with the prosecution case;</li><li>the accused in his confession has brought a new case about the parentage of the victim;</li><li>the very inconsistent statements of the condemned prisoner testify that he is insane;</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;">With these few words the learned Advocate appearing for the condemned prisoner in jail appeal prays for rejection of the death reference and prays for allowing the jail appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In order to prove the charge against the accused, the prosecution has examined as many as 15 witnesses in this case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 1 is Sadhina Begum. She is the informant and mother of the deceased. In her examination in chief she stated that on 06.08.2007 at about 7.30 A.M, her 3(three) sons, namely, 1. Sohag (12 years), 2. Sohan (8 years) and 3. Shuvon (7 years) (deceased) were playing on the pucca road in front of the shop of Shafiqul Islam (P.W. 8). At that time her neighbour Md. Sajjad Ali (accused herein) called Shuvon on the promise that he would give biscuit to Shuvon and took him away and the other two sons of the informant came home and on query they informed to her (informant) that accused Md. Sajjad Ali took away Shuvon towards north on the promise of giving biscuit to Shuvon. She (P.W. 1) then started searching Shuvon, but did not find him out. Thereafter, she informed the matter to Md. Idris Ali, member (P.W. 3). They searched whole night, but could not find him out. On the following day she lodged F.I.R. with the Motihar Police Station.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 1 further stated that Police arrested accused Md. Sajjad Ali and the accused made an extra judicial confession and in his extra judicial confession, he stated that he killed Shuvon by throttling and he also burnt some parts of Shuvon. P.W. 1 also stated the accused concealed the dead body of the deceased under the water of the <em>Moshureer beel</em> (hereinafter called bell) and hided the dead body of the deceased with the banana leaves and date leaves. P.W. 1 then stated that Police went to the beel with accused Md. Sajjad Ali and on the showing of the accused, police recovered the dead body of the deceased from the beel. She proved the pant of the deceased as material Ext. 1. She proved the F.I.R. as Ext. 1 and her signature therein as Ext. 1/1.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In cross-examination she stated that all 3(three) sons were her sons. She also stated that there were 6 houses near the place of occurrence where the boys were playing and the owner of those houses are Monser, Moslem, Ajar, Reazul (P.W. 11) and Guda. She also stated that her two sons came home at 7.00 P.M. The father of the informant lodged a G.D. Entry. Police came and they all tried to find out the deceased. <em>Moshureer beel</em> is a big beel and the people catch fish there during rainy season. She did not see the accused Md. Sajjad Ali taking away her son. The houses of the informant and that of accused are standing side by side. Accused had no enmity with any of the members of her family. Police arrested the accused before F.I.R. was lodged. She denied the suggestion that the accused was insane. She also denied the suggestion that the accused was loitering on the road aimlessly as because he was insane.

Sajjad Ali which runs as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"</strong><strong>আমি সম্পুর্ণ সজ্ঞানে, কারুর দ্বারা প্রভাবিত না হয়ে এইজবানবন্দি দিচ্ছি। আমি আগে গাড়ী চালাতাম। ঢাকার নাভানা হোটেলে ময়মনসিংহের এক মেয়ের সাথে আমার পরিচয় হয়- সে মেয়ে ছিল পতিতা । তার সাথে আমার দুইদিন মেলামেশা হয়েছে। প্রায় ছয় বছর আগে। আমি তাকে বলেছিলাম, আমার বাড়ী রাজশাহী, মতিহার থানা। কিছুদিন আগে আমাদের গ্রামে আমি ঐ মেয়েকে দেখি। ঐ মেয়ের নাম জানি। আমি ভয়ে কথা বলিনি। মেয়েটি একা ছিল। ফেস দেখে চিনতে পারি-ভয়ে কিছু জিজ্ঞাসা করতে পারিনি- তবে ঐ মেয়ে আমাকে দেখে ফেলে।</strong><br/><strong>এর পাঁচ মাস আগে আমার মামাতো বোন স্বাধীনা আমাকে বলে যে, শোভনকে আমাকে নিয়ে যেতে বলে- বলে, তুমি একে মানুষ কর। স্বাধীনা শোভনকে চার বছর ধরে মানুষ করছিল। ঐ ছেলে স্বাধীনার না নাভানা হোটেলের ঐ মেয়ে স্বাধীনার কাছে ছেলেটিকে মানুষ করতে দিয়ে যায়। আমি স্বাধীনাকে জিজ্ঞাসা করেছিলাম, তুমি এই ছেলেকে কোথায় পেলে? স্বাধীনা বলেছিল, এই ছেলেতো তোমারই, একটা মেয়ে আমার কাছে দিয়ে গেছে, ঐ মেয়ে আমার কাছে বলে গেছে তুমি এই ছেলের বাপ।</strong><br/><strong>তখন থেকেই আমি ঐ ছেলে, নাম শোভনকে মেনে নিতে পারিনি। </strong><br/><strong>দেড় মাস আগে আমি নাভানা হোটেলের ঐ মেয়েকে আমাদের গ্রামেদেখি। তখন থেকে আমার সন্দেহ হতে পারে ঐ ছেলে আমার। ঐ ছেলের চেহারা একদম আমার মত। আমি ঐ ছেলেকে লবষবষ ঝবণ্ঠ ড়ংশ¿গ্ধ খষলধ ন্বভখু অবভল রবযস্বল, ঢ়লবঝ ও ষজলস্লখ মেনে নেবেনা- আমাকে চেন্ডারে (আসামী এভাবেই বলে) দেবে। আমার বউ সানজিদা আমাকে একদিন বলে, তোমার নাকি একটা অবৈধ সন্তান আছে? ছি! তোমাকে আমি ঘেন্না করি। তারপর আমি এই কাজে বাধ্য হয়।</strong><br/><strong>৬/৮/০৭ তারিখ সন্ধ্যা সাড়ে ছয়টার দিকে আমি একটা বিয়ে থেকেবাড়ীর দিকে যাচ্ছিলাম। স্বাধীনার বাড়ীর সামনে আমি শোভনকে দেখি- শোভন আমার সাথে সাথে আসে।  ও ছিল পাগলা, পাগলা, মানুষকে ঢেলা মারে। ওকে দেখে আমার মনে হলো, ও বেচে থাকলে আমার ক্ষতি হবে- সমাজে আমার কলঙ্ক হবে। আমি শেষ হয়ে যাবো। </strong><br/><strong>শোভনকে নিয়ে আমি মশুরীর চরায় যাই। তারপর ওকে আমি পানিতে ঠেসে ধরি ও ছটফট করেছিল। কোন কথা বলেনি। কিছুক্ষণ পরে মারা যায়। লাশটা পানিতে ভেসে যায়। শোভনের পরনে একটা হাফপ্যান্ট ছিল অ্যাশ কালারের। গায়ে কোন জামা ছিল না। লাশ ওখানেই ভেসে ছিল। যে জমিতে আমি শোভনকে মারি, সেই জমি সেরাজ মুনন্সীর। জায়গাটা আমাদের গ্রাম রনহারে। যখন শোভনকে মারি, তখন সময় সাড়ে সাতটা। মারার সময় আমার সাথে কেউ ছিল না।</strong><br/><strong>মারার পর লাশ ঐখানে ফেলে আমি বাড়ী চলে আসি। ঘন্টা দুয়েক পরে স্বাধীনা আমার কাছে এসে বলে, শোভনকে পাচ্ছি না। আমি তার কাছে কিছু স্বীকার হইনি। উনি আমার নামে  সন্দেহমূলক থানায় জিডি করে। তারপর পুলিশ তদন্ত করে আমাকে ধরেণ আমি স্বেচ্ছায় সব স্বীকার করলাম। পুলিশের কাছেও তাই বলেছি। শোভন আমার ছেলে, আমার আরেকটা মেয়ে আছে। আমি ভুল করেছি, আমাকে স্যার ক্ষমা করেন। এরকম ভুল আমি আর কখনও করব না।"  </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">This is the confession of accused Sajjad Hossain. We find that the prosecution case and the case made out by the accused in his confession are not the same. P.W. 1 is the informant and she stated that she was the mother of the victim, Shuvon. Accused stated in his confession that one prostitute who used to work in Navana Hotel, Dhaka, was the mother of the victim. The accused also stated in his confession that he saw the lady who is the mother of the victim in his village. But she has not been examined by the prosecution. In fact, the confession of the accused runs counter to the prosecution case. The case made out by the accused in his confession and the case of the prosecution are diagonally opposite to each other. P.W. 1 stated that she was the mother of the deceased whereas the accused stated that one prostitute lady who used to work in Navana Hotel in Dhaka was the mother of the victim. Moreover, the accused in his confession stated that he was the father of the victim. But P.W. 1 is not the wife of the accused. Again, the husband of P.W. 1 is still alive, but he has not been examined by the prosecution to dispel the clouds from the mind of the people as to the parentage of the victim. Therefore, we find that the prosecution case is wrapped with full of mist. If we believe the confession of the accused, we have to disbelieve the prosecution case. And if we believe the prosecution case, we have to disbelieve the confession of the accused. If the confession of the accused runs counter to the prosecution case, the conviction cannot sustain in law. In such circumstances the accused-appellant is entitled to get the benefit of the decision taken in the case of Mizazul Islam Dablu Vs. The State 41 DLR (AD) 157.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Mizazul Islam alias Dablu Vs The State, reported in 41 DLR (AD) 157, it has been held that when the confession runs counter to the prosecution case, either prosecution case is false or confession is false and both cannot go together. At the end, the Appellate Division acquitted the accused.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 1 is the informant and she claims to be the mother of the victim. She stated that she had 3 sons, namely, Sohag (12 years), Sohan (8 years) and Shuvon (7 years) (victim). But the accused in his confessional statement stated in no uncertain terms that one prostitute who used to serve in Navana Hotel was the mother of the victim. This lady also visited the village where the accused was living, but she has not been examined by the prosecution to ascertain the motherhood/fatherhood of the child. In fact none of the prosecution witnesses stated that the accused is the father and the prostitute girl is the mother of the victim.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">So, the parentage of the child remains totally unclear. If P.W. 1 is not the mother of the victim, the prosecution case falls through. Unfortunately, the husband of the informant has not come to support his wife, P.W. 1. This behavior of the husband of P.W. 1 creates doubts about the parentage of the victim and also the total prosecution case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now, the question is that P.W. 2, 11, 12, have stated that they saw the accused to take away the victim, Shovon. We find that all these 3 P.Ws. stated that the accused took away the victim from in front of the shop of Shafiqul. This Shafiqul has been examined by the prosecution as P.W. 8. But he has been tendered by the prosecution. Rezaul (P.W. 11) stated that he, Rubel (P.W. 12), Saiful (P.W. 8) and Ziarul (not examined) were sitting on the <em>"macha"</em> (raised sitting place of a shop mostly in village area) of the shop of Shafiqul and at that time they saw accused Sajjad Ali taking away the victim. But this P.W. 11 did not state to the father and mother of the victim that the accused took away their son. Rubel has been examined by the prosecution as P.W. 12. P.W. 12 stated that Rezaul (P.W. 11), Shafiqul (P.W. 8), Ziarul (not examined) were sitting on the <em>"macha"</em> of the shop and at that time they saw the accused taking away Shovon. But he did not see recovery of the dead body of Shuvon. He stated that he heard that the dead body of Shuvon was recovered from the beel. But he did not even mention from whom he heard this.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned D.A.G. contends that as the accused was seen last with the victim and as the victim was found dead after he was seen last with the accused, none else but the accused is responsible for the death of the victim. In support of his contention, the learned DAG refers to the case of Anisur Rahman and others Vs The State, reported in 1986 BLD (AD) 79.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case referred to above, the Appellate Division has held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“...............there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the son and wife of the deceased who are undoubtedly the most natural and material witnesses as to the calling away of the deceased by the appellants from the house of the deceased, after which the deceased was not found till his dead body was recovered in the sugarcane field on the next day. In the absence of any other reasonable explanation as to the safe departure of the deceased from the company of the appellants after they had called him away from his house at night, no conclusion other than the guilt of the appellants can be drawn”. </div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">P.W. 2, 11 and 12 allege that they saw the accused taking away the victim. But P.W. 2 is a 12 year old boy. A child witness cannot be relied upon without prudent corroboration (Ref: Rashid Vs. The State 10 DLR 532= PLD 1959-181; Gadu Mia Vs. The State 44 DLR 246). Such corroboration is absent in the present case. P.W. 11 also stated that at the time of taking away the victim, Shafiqul was present in the shop. But Shafiqul has been tendered by the prosecution. P.W. 12 again stated that he heard that the dead body of the deceased was recovered from the beel. He is also a hearsay witness and he did not also state from whom he heard about the recovery of the dead body from the beel.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the above mentioned referred case (Anisur Rahman and other Vs. The State, 1986 BLD (AD) 79 son and wife were the witnesses as to the calling away of the deceased by the accused. But in the instant case P.W. Nos. 11 and 12 are 3<sup>rd</sup> persons and they are not natural witnesses, they may be termed as a chance witnesses. Though P.W. 2 is the son of the informant, he is a minor boy. Therefore, the principle enuntiated in the case referred to above is not applicable in facts and circumstances of the case is hand.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate appearing for the accused contends that in the present case there are two circumstances, one is calling away the victim from in front of the shop of Shafiqul and the second circumstance is taking the victim to <em>Moshureer beel</em> from in front of the shop of Shafiqul. P.W. Nos. 2, 11 and 12 allege that they saw the accused taking away the victim from in front of the shop of Shafiqul Islam. We have already discussed the value of the evidence of P.W. Nos. 2, 11 and 12. However, we find that there is absolutely no evidence at all to prove that accused took the victim to<em> Moshureer beel</em> from in front of the shop of Shafiqul. Therefore, the second circumstance, that is, taking away the victim to <em>Moshureer beel</em> from in front of the shop of Shafiqul has not been proved at all. As such, the accused cannot be held responsible for the murder of the victim. In support of his contention, the learned Advocate for the accused refers to the case of The State Vs Khasru alias Syed Mostafa Hossain and another, reported in 43 DLR (AD) 182. In the case referred to above, it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“the fact of calling away of the victim Khairul by the accused Khasru was satisfactorily established as the first circumstance in support of the prosecution and witnesses have also satisfactorily proved that the victim travelled with the two accused from their village Noapara to a distant place called Takerhat by bus and got down there at 4.00/4.30 P.M. on 04.01.1979. This is the second circumstance proved against the accused. From this point onward up to the time of recovery of the body of Khairul at about 3.00/3.30 P.M. on the following day the accused were alleged to have been seen along with the deceased, the third circumstance in the absence of ocular evidence of murder by, P.Ws. 11 and 12, the High Court Division rejected their evidence due to apparent contradiction between their evidence and the statement made by them before the police and also for the reason that their identification of the accused in the T.I. Parade had lost all significance in view of the fact that they had chance to see the accused. There has been no violation of any norm or procedure in assessing the evidence of the said two witnesses for which the finding of fact made by the High Court Division could be disturbed. The position therefore comes this that the third circumstance, that of, seen the three boys together near the bank of the river where the victim’s body was found was not satisfactorily established. The circumstances of the case can never be said to be conclusive as to the guilt of accused of Khasru and his brother Nowab. The High Court Division has correctly applied the rule as to circumstantial evidence in the facts of the present case.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts and circumstances of the case referred to above and the facts and circumstances of the case in hand are identical. Therefore, the principle expounded in the case referred to above fully applies in the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Ismail Sarker @ Sudan Member and other vs. the State reported in 33 DLR 320, it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“if the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused appellants at about 10 P.M. on the night of occurrence and subsequently his dead body was seen in the river Titas at about noon on next day, from such facts alone it cannot be held that the accused appellant in any way had any plan to murder deceased Mohar Ali or in any manner abetted the commission of the murder of deceased Mohar Ali.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. S.M. Shahjahan, the learned advocate lastly refers to the case of Bablu @ Babu (Md) Vs the State 60 DLR, 583 and submits that it is well settled that “last seen together is a weak type of circumstantial evidence and conviction cannot be given on the basis of “last seen together” theory alone.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case referred to above it has been held as under:<br/>“……….. it is well settled law that last  seen together is a weak type of circumstantial evidence on which to have a conviction, a link between the accused and the murder has to be proved.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The decisions cited above fully applies in the case in hand as the facts and circumstances of the case in hand and the facts and circumstances of the case referred to above are similar and identical.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Now, let us address the last important point raised by the learned Lawyer for the accused-appellant. He raised the point that the accused was insane and the learned Sessions Judge did not give any decision on the question of insanity before proceeding with the case and the learned Sessions Judge most arbitrarily examined as many as 13 witnesses before giving any dicision on the point of insanity raised by the accused.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned advocate appearing on behalf of the accused appellant also contends that from the very beginning of the case, the accused appellant has been claiming that he is insane. At the earliest, that is, on 02.09.2007, the accused first brought to the notice of the Magistrate that he was insane. The learned Magistrate considered the application and directed the jail authority to provide with necessary treatment to the accused. Thereafter, the case record was sent to the learned Sessions Judge for trial as the case was triable by the Sessions Judge. On 12.11.2007, the accused filed an application before the learned Sessions Judge intimating him that the accused was insane and if the charge was framed against him he would be prejudiced as he was not capable of making his defence because of insanity. On 12.11.2007, the learned Sessions Judge did not give any decision on the allegation of insanity of the accused. However, the learned Sessions Judge fixed 25.11.2007 for hearing of framing of charge. The learned Sessions Judge, however, framed charge against the accused on 09.01.2008 under section 302/201 of the Penal Code. On 04.02.2008, the accused again filed an application before the learned Sessions Judge stating that the accused was insane and also prayed for sending the accused to Pabna Mental Hospital for treatment. On this application, the learned Sessions Judge did not pass any order and kept the application with the record. Again on 08.10.2008, the accused filed another application under section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and prayed for providing the accused with necessary treatment. On this application no order was passed on 08.10.2008 the ground that the copy of the application was not served upon the learned Public Prosecutor. However, on 6.11.2008, the learned Sessions Judge passed order on the application filed by the accused under section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Sessions Judge passed the order as under:              </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“There is nothing in the record to show that the accused Md. Sajjad Ali is of unsound mind. He was arrested immediately after the lodging of the case on 07.08.2007 and thereafter he was produced before the Magistrate. His confessional statement was recorded on 08.08.2007 by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Rajshahi. But the learned Magistrate did not notice any sign of unsoundness of mind of accused Md. Sajjad Ali.<br/>This court received the case record on 24.10.2007 and by this time all the witnesses (numbering 13) except the Investigating Officer have been examined. I have not marked any sign of unsoundness of mind of the accused. He has taken his defence and he has cross examined all the witnesses. Therefore, the allegation that accused Md. Sajjad Ali is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making his defence appears to be totally false and baseless. Therefore, the petition is rejected”.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">From the record we find that on 12.11.2007 the accused first brought to the notice of the learned Sessions Judge that the accused was insane. The learned Sessions Judge examined the prosecution witness first on 25.03.2008, this means, the learned Sessions Judge without giving any decision on this point of  insanity proceeded with the case and examined as many as 13 witnesses. On 06.11.2008, the learned Sessions Judge rejected the application filed under section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is, therefore, clear that the learned Sessions Judge gave decision on the point of insanity long after the matter was brought to his notice and in the meantime the learned Sessions Judge examined as many as 13 prosecution witnesses.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Again, we find that the learned Sessions Judge did not find that the accused was insane and that he did not accept the contention of the learned Lawyer of the accused that accused was incapable of making his defence. In fact, before he arrived at such decision, he should have taken specialist doctor’s opinion whether the accused was insane or not. It is said that the court is always expert of all experts but not always. In certain cases court should look for the expert opinion before giving its decision. Since the defence has been insisting right from the very beginning of the case that the accused is insane, the learned Sessions Judge should have obtained doctor’s opinion before forming his definite opinion as to the insanity of the accused. In such situation, the learned Sessions Judge should not have arrived at a decision on the basis of his unprofessional knowledge.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. S.M. Shahjahan, the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the condemned prisoner contends that when an accused is brought before the court with the allegation that the accused is insane, the first  duty of the court is to ascertain whether the accused is really insane or not. In support of his contention the learned Advocate refers to the case of Shama Tudu Vs The State, reported in 1987 Crl. L. J. 618. In the case referred to above, it has been held that the accused killed his wife and only son, but the evidence and the conduct of accused show that accused was unable to understand the nature of his act due to insanity at crucial point of time, and the accused is entitled to benefit of S. 84. Accused is entitled acquittal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Wally Ahmed alias Babi Vs The State, reported in 58 DLR 433, a Division Bench of this Court has held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“.............But the learned Judge of the trial court without following the procedure for trial in case of a person being lunatic before Court of Sessions as laid down in section 465 of the Code of Criminal Procedure continued the proceedings. The provisions of the section are mandatory and failure of the court to do so rendered the entire subsequent proceedings illegal and is of no legal effect which would vitiate the conviction and sentence. With this regard reliance can be placed in the case of Khan Baig Vs. State reported in PLD 1984 Lahore 434”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">From the decisions cited above, we are constrained to hold that the learned Sessions Judge should have obtained specialist doctor’s opinion before rejecting the application on the basis of his unprofessional knowledge. On the point of insanity, we also hold the view that since the accused brought to the notice of the learned Session Judge about the insanity long back on 12.11.2007, the learned Sessions Judge should have given his decision on the point of insanity before examination of witnesses and he should not have examined on many as 13 witnesses before giving his decision as the point of insanity.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Md. Bashir Ullah, the learned Deputy Attorney General, on the other hand, refers to the case of Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakkar, appellant Vs The State of Gujarat, reported in AIR 1964(SC) 1563 (V 51 C 210) at page 1563. In the case referred to above it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“When a plea of legal insanity is set up, the Court has to consider whether at the time of commission of the offence the accused, by reason of unsoundness of mind, was incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he was doing what was either wrong or contrary to law. The crucial point of time for ascertaining the state of mind of the accused is the time when the offence was committed. Whether the accused was in such a state of mind as to be entitled to the benefit of S. 84 of the Penal Code can only be established from the circumstances which preceded, attended and followed the crime”.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Though the learned D.A.G referred to the above decision, we do not under stand how this decision helps the prosecution. In our view this decision is equally helpful for the accused ……</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned D.A.G. lastly refers to the case of Mobarak Ali Vs Md. Hachi Miah, reported in 17 DLR (1965) 68. In the case referred to above it has been held as under:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The law on this point is clear under section 464 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the Magistrate has to make an enquiry only when he finds that there is reason to believe that the accused is unsound mind. Similarly when a case is before a Court of Sessions that Court may also enquire into the question of insanity if it “appears to that Court”, that the accused is of unsound mind.<br/>If the accused is reasonably believed to be of unsound mind, it is always open to a Court of Sessions to take action under section 465”.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">There is no dispute about the decisions cited above. In our view the above decision is not applicable in the case in hand as the facts and circumstances of the case in hand and the facts and circumstances of the case referred to above are not similar and identical. Because in the case in hand, the defence has been insisting right from the beginning of the case that the accused is insane. On 02.09.2007, the defence first brought to the notice of the Magistrate that the accused was insane and the learned Magistrate being convinced directed the jail authority to provide the accused with proper treatment. With such State of affairs the Sessions Judge should not have arrived at a decision that the accused was not insane with his unprofessional knowledge.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We find that the defence did not leave no stone unturned to bring the allegation of insanity before the Sessions Judge right from the very beginning. But the learned Sessions Judge without having any opinion from the professional person held that the accused was not insane. In our view since the accused brought to the notice of the learned Sessions Judge about the insanity of the accused right from his beginning, the learned Sessions Judge should have obtained opinion from the professional person (in the present case, it is specialist doctor) before giving the decision that the accused was not insane. In any view of the matter, the learned Sessions Judge should not have proceeded with the case and recorded the evidence of the prosecution witnesses before giving decision on the point of insanity of the accused.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Again, in his statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused has stated: “<strong>শোভনকে নিয়ে অামি মশুরির চরায় যাইz তারপর ওকে অামি পানিতে ঠেসে ধরি- ও ছটফট করেছিলz কোন কথা বলেনিz কিছুক্ষণ পরে মারা যায়z লাশটা পানিতে ভেসে যায়z শোভনের পরনে একটা হাফপ্যান্ট ছিলz অ্যাশ কালারেরz গায়ে কোন জামা ছিল নাz লাশ ওখানেই ভেসেছিলz যে জমিতে অামি শোভনকে মারি, সেই জমি সেরাজ মুন্সীরz'</strong>'</li><li style="text-align: justify;">But in the post mortem report it has been mentioned that the death was due to asphyxia following manual strangulation (throttling). But according to the confessional statement the cause of death was drowning. Therefore, we find that the confessional statement of the accused is not consistent with the prosecution case, the post mortem report and the inquest report.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Another important point is required to be addressed here is that in the inquest report it has been stated that there was sign of burn on the person of the body of the deceased. But no where it has been stated in the post mortem report that there was sign of burn on the person of the body of the deceased. Again, the investigating officer (P.W. 15) has stated that on 06.08.2007, a G.D. Entry was lodged but he did not procure a copy of the G.D. Entry. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to show the result of the G. D. Entry. P.W. 4 who is the maternal grandfather of the deceased and the father of the informant stated that police arrested his two sons, namely, Ruhul and Reha in connection with the case. But they have not been made by accused in the case, even they have not been cited as witness in this case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Considering all these facts, circumstances and the evidence on record we are of the opinion that the prosecution has not been able to prove the charge against the condemned prisoner beyond doubt. Therefore, the condemned prisoner is liable to be acquitted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Death Reference No. 133 of 2008 is rejected and the Criminal Appeal No. 8657 of 2008 and the Jail Appeal No. 30 of 2009 are allowed. The impugned judgment and order dated 01.12.2008 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Rajshahi, in Sessions Case No. 609 of 2008 arising out of Motihar P. S. Case No. 03 dated 07.08.2007, corresponding to MGR No. 690 of 2007 is set aside. The condemned prisoner Md. Sajjad Ali is found not guilty of the charge brought against him and he is acquitted there from. The condemned prisoner shall be at liberty forthwith if not wanted in connection with any other case.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Send down the lower court records with a copy of this judgment to the concerned court at once.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         <strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div></div></div>

The Tribunal has to be satisfied that proof of both the requirements were available in the report. Thus taking cognizance of the offence in the instant case was illegal and although this point was not considered by the High Court Division, we are of the view that on this count also the proceedings was also liable to be quashed. Sub-section 1(Ga), of the Ain has given power to the Tribunal to take cognizance of the offence on some other grounds in case no recommendation for taking cognizance is made in the enquiry report, but it has not given any authority to the Tribunal to take cognizance of an offence if the fact of going to the police officer to lodge the complaint is not stated in the report. We </strong><strong>find no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division.      ...</strong><strong>(11 and </strong><strong>12)</strong></div><br/><strong>Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 488 of 2011<br/>For the Petitioner: </strong>Mr. Pankaj Kumar Kundu, Advocate, instructed by Mr. Gias Uddin Ahmed, Advocate-on-Record.<br/><strong>For Respondent Nos. 1-4: </strong>Mr. Zainul Abedin, Advocate-on-Record.<br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong><u>Md. Nizamul Huq, J</u></strong>: This criminal petition for leave to appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 20.07.2011 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.2502 of 2011 arising out of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Case No.94 of 2010 under section 11(Ga)/30 of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain-2000(as amended in 2003), hereinafter referred to as the Ain, now pending in the Court of Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Patuakhali making the Rule absolute and thereby quashing the proceedings of the above mentioned case.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts, leading to the filing of the petition for leave to appeal, are that the petitioner as complainant filed a petition of complainant before the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Patuakhali on the allegation that she had been married to respondent No.1 Md. Nazmul Islam on 30.10.2009, that soon after marriage at the instance of other respondents he demanded dowry of Tk. 1,20,000/- to purchase a motorbike, and asked her to bring the dowry and sent her to her father’s house, later on a meeting of reconciliation was held at the residence of the complainant but it failed, and as the accused persons were leaving the house of the complainant, he tried to resist them along with the other inmate of the house, respondent No.1 with the intention to kill her inflicted a stick blow on her head for dowry.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Upon examination of the complainant the learned Judge of the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Tribunal sent the matter to the Head Master, Hajikhali Secondary School, for enquiry, who submitted report on 07.04.2010 stating that he found substance in the allegations and on the basis of the report the learned Judge of the Tribunal took cognizance against respondent Nos.1-4 hereinafter referred to as the respondents on 25.04.2010 under section 11(Ga) and 30 of the Ain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After issuance of the process the respondents appeared before the Tribunal on 22.06.2010 and they were enlarged on bail.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Thereafter, the respondents as petitioners filed a petition under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court Division for quashment of the proceeding of the Nari-O-Shishu Case NO.94 of 2010 under section 11(Ga)/30 of the Ain and obtained the Rule. The petition was numbered as Miscellaneous Case No.2502 of 2010. The complainant petitioner as opposite party contested the miscellaneous case by filing a counter affidavit denying all the statements made by the respondents.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">After hearing the miscellaneous case, the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 20.07.2011, made the Rule absolute and quashed the proceedings on the finding that the allegations made in the petition of complaint were absurd, improbable and the case had been instituted only to harass the respondents and the impugned proceedings was nothing but an abuse of the process of the Court. Against the said judgment and order of the High Court Division the complainant has filed the instant Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal. </li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard Mr. Pankaj Kumar Kundu, the learned Advocate for the complainant and Mr. Zainul Abedin, learned Advocate-on-record who entered caveat on behalf of the respondents.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Pankaj Kumar Kundu submitted that upon plain reading of the petition of complaint it was clear that there was specific allegation against the respondents in respect of an offence under section 11(Ga) of the Ain and an inquiry made by a Head Master of the school the allegations were found true and upon receipt of the inquiry report the learned Judge of the Tribunal took cognizance of the case against the respondents. In such context without taking evidence it was not proper to say that the case was false and not believable and the impugned proceedings could not be said to be an abuse of the process of the Court and as such, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division is liable to be interfered by giving leave.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that in the petition of complaint the complainant alleged that her husband and others (the respondents) went to the residence of her father and thereafter tortured her there demanding dowry which the High Court found not believable at all. Upon perusal of the allegations we find that the High Court Division has rightly observed that allegations were absurd and improbable and the case should not be allowed to continue on the basis of such allegations. It also appears that the High Court Division considered that respondent No.1 instituted civil suit for cancellation of the Kabinanma on 15.01.2010 before the filing of the petition of complaint and after that the instant complaint was filed, which also created a doubt about the truth of the complaint case. Considering all these things the High Court Division came to the finding that if they allow to continue the further proceeding of the instant case, it would be an illegal harassment of the respondents and invoking its inherent jurisdiction under section 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure quashed the proceedings to secure ends of justice.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It further appears that beside, the above, there is another point which has not been considered by the High Court Division. As stated earlier the Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunal, Patuakhali upon receipt of the petition of complaint sent the same for inquiry to the Head Master Hajikhali High School and the Head Master in his inquiry report dated 07.04.2010 stated only that-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“<strong>বিবাদীগণ স্বাক্ষীসহ উপসিÛতz জবানবন্দিতে জানিতে পারিয়া আমার মনে হয় অত্র মামলার সত্যতা আছেz</strong>”<br/>And on receipt of that report the Tribunal passed order in the following:<br/>“<strong>প্রাপ্ত তদ¿¹ প্রতিবেদন ও নথি পর্যালোচনা করিয়া দেখিলামz আসামীগণের বিরুদ্ধে অপরাধ আমলে লওয়ার মত উপাদান বিদ্যমান থাকায় আসামী ১z মোঃ নাজমুল ইসলাম, ২z সুলতান শরীফ, ৩z ফোরকান শরীফ, ৪z খলিল শরিফের বিরুদ্ধে নারী ও শিশু নির্যাতন দমন(সংশোধন) আইন ২০০৩ এর ১১(গ) ধারার অপরাধ আমলে লওয়া হইলz</strong>”<br/>And issued warrant against the respondent No.1 and summons against the respondent nos.2-4.<br/>Section 27 of the Ain-2000 reads as follows:<br/><strong>27)</strong>          <strong>ট্রাইব্যনালের এখতিয়ার- (১) সাব-ইন্সপেক্টর পদমর্যাদার নিম্নে নহেন এমন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তা বা এতদুদ্দেশ্যে সরকারের নিকট হইতে সাধারণ বা বিশেষ আদেশ দ্বারা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত কোন ব্যক্তির লিখিত রিপোর্ট ব্যতিরেকে কোন ট্রাইব্যুনাল কোন অপরাধ বিচারার্থ গ্রহণ করিবেন নাz </strong><br/><strong>(১ক) কোন অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তিকে কোন অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন মর্মে হলফনামা সহিকারে ট্রাই্যুনালের নিকট অভিযোগ দাখিল করিলে ট্রাইব্যুনাল অভিযোগকারীকে পরীক্ষা করিয়া-</strong><br/><strong>(ক) স¿ºষ্ট হইলে অভিযোগটি অনুসন্ধানের (ভশহয়ভক্ষঁ) জন্য কোন ম্যাজিস্ট্রেট কিংবা অন্য কোন ব্যক্তিকে নির্দেশ প্রদান করিবেন এবং অনুসন্ধানের জন্য নির্দেশপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি অভিযোগটি অনুসন্ধান করিয়া সাত কার্য দিবসের মধ্যে ট্রাইব্যুনালের নিকট রিপোর্ট প্রদান করিবেন;</strong><br/><strong>(খ) স¿ºষ্ট না হইলে অভিযোগটি সরাসরি নাকোচ করিবেনz </strong><br/><strong>(১খ) উপ-ধারা (১ক) এর অধীন রিপোর্ট প্রাপ্তির পর কোন ট্রাইব্যুনাল যদি এই মর্মে স¿ºষ হয়      যে, </strong><br/><strong>(ক) অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তিকে কোন অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন এবং অভিযোগের সমর্থনে প্রাথমিক সাক্ষ্য প্রমাণ আছে সেই ক্ষেত্রে ট্রাইব্যুনাল উক্ত রিপোট ও অভিযোগের ভিত্তিতে অপরাধটি বিচারার্থ গ্রহণ করিবেন;</strong><br/><strong>(খ) অভিযোগকারী উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন কোন পুলিশ কর্মকর্তাকে বা ক্ষমতাপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তিকে কোন অপরাধের অভিযোগ গ্রহণ করিবার জন্য অনুরোধ করিয়া ব্যর্থ হইয়াছেন মর্মে প্রমাণ পাওয়া যায় নাই কিংবা অভিযোগের সমর্থনে কোন প্রাথমিক সাক্ষ্য প্রমাণ পাওয়া যায় নাই সেই ক্ষেত্রে ট্রাইব্যুনাল অভিযোগটি নাকচ করিবেন;</strong><br/><strong>(১গ) উপ-ধারা (১) এবং (১ক) এর অধীন প্রাপ্ত রিপোর্ট কোন ব্যক্তির বিরুদ্ধে অপরাধ সংঘটনের অভিযোগ বা তৎসম্পর্ক কার্যত্র্রম গ্রহণের সুপারিশ না থাকা সত্তেÆও ট্রাইব্যুনাল, যথাযথ এবং ন্যায়বিচারের স্বার্থে প্রয়োজনীয় মনে করিলে, কারণ উল্লেখপূর্বক উক্ত ব্যক্তির ব্যাপারে সংশ্লিষ্ট অপরাধ বিচারার্থে গ্রহণ করিতে পারিবেন</strong><br/><strong>(২) যে ট্রাইব্যুনালের এখতিয়ারাধীন এলাকায় কোন অপরাধ বা ড~হার কোন অংশ সংঘটিত হইয়াছে অথবা যেখানে অপরাধীকে বা একাধীক অপরাধীর ক্ষেত্রে, তাহাদের যে কোন একজনকে পাওয়া গিয়াছে, সেই সÛান যে ট্রাইব্যুনালের এখতিয়ারাধীন, সেই ট্রাইব্যুনালে অপরাধটি বিচারার্থে গ্রহণের জন্য রিপোর্ট বা অভিযোগ পেশ করা যাইবে এবং সেই ট্রাইব্যুনাল অপরাধটির বিচার করিবেz </strong><br/><strong>(৩) যদি এই আইনের অধীন কোন অপরাধের সহিত অন্য কোন অপরাধ এমনভাবে জড়িত থাকে যে, ন্যায়বিচারের স্বার্থে উভয় অপরাধের বিচার একই সংগে বা একই মামলায় করা প্রয়োজন, তাহা হইলে উক্ত অন্য অপরাধটির বিচার এই আইনের অধীন অপরাধের সহিত এই আইনের বিধান অনুসরণে একই সংগে বা একই ট্রাইব্যুনালে করা যাইবেz </strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">From the above, it is clear that if a petition of complaint is filed, the Tribunal is to see whether any affidavit has been filed stating the facts that the complainant requested one police officer as mentioned in sub-section(1) or empowered person to receive the complaint and failed and if it is found that the affidavit has been filed stating that fact, then the Tribunal will examine the complainant and if satisfied will send the petition of complaint for enquiry to any Magistrate or any other person and the concerned person shall within 7(seven) days submit a report to the Tribunal. If the Tribunal is not satisfied then he will dismiss the complaint. In this case the requirement of law so far this part is concerned has been complied with. But Clause second (Kha) of sub-section 1 (Kha) states that upon receipt of the report under sub-section 1(Ka), if the Tribunal finds that there was no proof that the complainant failed upon requesting one police officer under sub-section (1) or the empowered person to receive the complaint and that there was no prima-facie evidence in support of the allegation made in the petition of complaint in that case, the Tribunal shall dismiss the complaint. In the instant case we find that the enquiry report as mentioned above does not contain any proof that the complainant requested the police officer or the empowered person to receive the complaint and failed as such, it is clear that there is no proof in support of this part of the requirement of law and as such, the Tribunal ought to have dismissed the complaint, but it without doing so took cognizance on the plea that there were prima-facie materials in support of the allegation against the accused, but that was not sufficient. The Tribunal has to be satisfied that proof of both the requirements were available in the report. Thus taking cognizance of the offence in the instant case was illegal and although this point was not considered by the High Court Division, we are of the view that on this count also the proceedings was also liable to be quashed. Sub-section 1(Ga), of the Ain has given power to the Tribunal to take cognizance of the offence on some other grounds in case no recommendation for taking cognizance is made in the enquiry report, but it has not given any authority to the Tribunal to take cognizance of an offence if the fact of going to the police officer to lodge the complaint is not stated in the report.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above, we find no illegality in the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court Division. As such, the petition has got no merit.           </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, this Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal is dismissed.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
