Even if some bills or LCs are the subject matter of any investigation by any agency, we do not find any provision in the relevant laws under which a bank can stop payment or re-imbursement on such LCs. A bank under the law and banking practice, in particular in accordance with the relevant provisions of UCP-600, is bound to make payment or re-imbursement in respect of the accepted bills once they are accepted by the </strong><strong>issuing banks, and in view of the said provisions</strong><strong> of the UCP-600, namely Article-16, once such acceptance is given, the matter is closed and the concerned banks are precluded from raising any issue thereafter. Even if the banks have in the meantime filed any criminal case against the petitioner for commission of such fraud, the payment in respect of the said bills cannot be stopped unless and until the banks obtain </strong><strong>an order from a competent Court for stoppage</strong><strong> of re-imbursement.    ...(19, 22 and 23)</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>Advocate For the petitioner (In Writ Petition No. 5210 of 2013) </u></strong><br/>Mr. Shamsuddin Babul, Advocate with<br/>Mr. Kanailal Shaha,<br/> <br/><strong><u>For the respondent No. 3 (In Writ Petition No. 5210 of 2013)</u></strong><br/>Mr. Md.

In Writ Petition No. 5210 of 2013</strong>, Rule Nisi was issued calling upon the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 to show cause as to why the inaction of the respondent No. 3 in payment of the outstanding export bills of the petitioner amounting to Tk. US$ 10,89,000.00  along with the interest as per the terms of the Letters of Credit (L/C) for non-payment on the date of maturity overdue interest of the Proforma-respondent Nos. 4 against the L/C being Nos. 037011041230, 037011041235, 037011041236, 037011041237, 037011041238, 037011041239, 037011041949, 037011041950 and 037011041951, Annexure-B  series, if the same do not fall under the cause of fraud of the petitioner by any investigation, specially conducted by Anti-corruption Commission, should not be declared to be without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect, and as to why the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 should not be directed to take necessary steps for payment of the said outstanding export bills of the petitioner amounting to US$ 10,89,000.00 along with the interest of the respondent No.4 bank at 16% per annum for delay period and other overdue charges. <br/> <br/><strong>3.

In the course of its business, the petitioner received nine back to back L/Cs (“BB L/Cs”), being LC Nos. 037011041230, 037011041235, 037011041236, 037011041237, 037011041238, 037011041239, 037011041949, 037011041950 and 037011041951, issued by Sonali Bank (respondent No. 3) for supply of yarn to purchasers. The expiry dates of the said LCs were 20.08.2011 and 25.09.2011, stipulating that the negotiating bank, namely the Agrani Bank Limited, Amin Court Branch, Dhaka (respondent No. 4), would get the payment against the said L/Cs after twenty days on maturity and that the payment would only be due upon fulfillment of conditions in the said LCs and letter of acceptance of the said L/Cs issued by the L/C issuing bank. Upon receipt of the said L/Cs, after endorsement by the negotiating bank, the petitioner manufactured the said goods and supplied the same upon fulfilling the terms and conditions mentioned in the said L.Cs and, accordingly, submitted the delivery documents, such as delivery chalans, Mushak-11 forms etc., before the negotiating bank. Thereupon, since the negotiating bank found no discrepancy in the said documents and found the same incompliance with the terms of the said L/Cs, it issued forwarding letters to the L.C issuing bank indicating that the said supply of yarns were made by the petitioner as against the said L/Cs. Upon receipt of the said supply by the purchasers, the negotiating bank made the payments against the said bills to the petitioner and, accordingly, forwarded the said bills to the L/C issuing bank through official channel for re-imbursement. However, even after expiry of the maturity dates as stipulated in the said L/Cs, the L/C issuing Bank (Sonali Bank) having not paid or re- imbursed the said L/C amounts, the negotiating bank issued several letters addressing the Sonali Bank for taking necessary steps to re-emburse the said amounts upon honouring the said bills, but got no positive response. This being so, the negotiating bank started taking steps for realizing the said amounts from the petitioner and issued letter dated 02.05.2013 stating that since the L/C issuing bank-Sonali Bank did not honour  the said bills, petitioner was liable to pay the same. It is further stated that since the negotiating bank has taken steps for realizing the said amounts from the petitioner for no fault of the petitioner, but for the default of the L/C issuing bank in honouring the said LC’s in accordance with law, the petitioner is at high risk of being treated as defaulter-borrower and classified in the CIB report published by the Bangladesh Bank, thereby, depriving it from getting any credit facilities from any bank or financial institutions. Consequently, since the business of the petitioner is facing serious impacts by such attempts by the negotiating bank because of the default of the L/C issuing Bank, the petitioner moved this Court and obtained the aforesaid Rule. By way of the supplementary affidavit, it is further stated by the petitioner that even the Board of Directors of the L/C issuing bank-Sonali Bank in its 362<sup>nd </sup>meeting resolved to honour 94 (ninety four) inland bills including those of the petitioners, and since the concerned bills of the petitioner are admittedly not the subject matter of any enquiry or investigation by the Anti Corruption Commission in respect of any financial scam, the inactions of the Sonali Bank, and the inaction of the Bangladesh Bank in taking appropriate actions against Sonali Bank as regulating authority, are malafide and arbitrary.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> In <strong>Writ Petition No. 9305 of 2013</strong>, it is stated that the petitioner, being engaged in the business of dyeing yarn, bleaching, washing etc., received 16 (sixteen) BB L/Cs from Bangladesh Krishi Bank (respondent No. 4) and 18 BB L.Cs from Sonali Bank (respondent No. 3) to supply different garment accessories to various purchaser companies. The description of the said LCs are as follows;<br/> <br/><strong>6. <u>LC issuing Bank- Bangladesh Krishi Bank (respondent No. 4)</u></strong><br/> </div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 17px;

The petitioner, accordingly, submitted the delivery documents of the said goods before the respective negotiating banks, whereupon the negotiating banks forwarded the same to the L/C issuing Banks as no discrepancy therein was detected. Thereupon, the L/C issuing Banks, namely the Krishi Bank and Sonali Bank, accepted the said bills and issued acceptance letters. However, though long time, namely more than one year, has elapsed, the said bills are yet to be re-imbursed by the LC issuing banks, thereby, putting the petitioner at the risk of becoming defaulter-borrower and depriving it from obtaining any credit facilities from any bank or financial institutions in view of the provisions under Section 27 Ka Ka of the Bank Companies Act, 1991. It is further stated, by way of supplementary affidavit, that in respect of the said bills no investigation or enquiry is going on by the Anti-Corruption Commission and the bills accepted by the Sonali Bank are included in the said 94 (ninety four) bills as mentioned in the resolution of the Board of Directors of Sonali Bank in its 362<sup>nd</sup> meeting resolving that those bills should be honoured.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> The above Rules are opposed by the L/C issuing Banks through learned Advocates, who filled affidavits-in-opposition, mainly contending that those bills are the subject matter of the un-precedented financial scam as perpetrated by the Hallmark group, and after investigation of the said scam, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has already submitted charge sheets against the people behind such scam including some high officials of the Sonali Bank. It is further contended that since the writ petitions are mainly for realization of money which is disputed, this Court, under writ jurisdiction, is not the proper forum for resolving such dispute. It is further stated through the Krishi Bank’s affidavit in opposition in Writ Petition No. 9305 of 2013 that the ultimate foreign currency against those bills has never repatriated in the country as no exports in fact took place and that in view of the instructions given by the Bangladesh Bank in BRPD Circular Nos. 10 and 13 dated 11.07.2012 and 09.09.2012 respectively, the L/C issuing banks are entitled to withhold payments until investigation initiated by those L/C issuing banks in respect of the said bills are completed.<br/> <br/><strong><u>SUBMISSIONS</u></strong>:<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Mr. Shamsuddin Babul, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 5210 of 2013, submits that this Court and the superior Courts of this sub-continent have time and again held that in documentary credits the bank deals with documents and not with the goods and as such the moment the documents are found to be without any discrepancy,  any underlying disputes regarding actual supply or short supply or defective supply of the said goods cannot in any way impact upon the payment on the L/Cs. Referring to the relevant annexures in the writ petition, in particular letters of the concerned negotiating bank addressing the Sonali Bank that the bills have been accepted by the Sonali Bank as the same were found without any discrepancy, Mr. Babul submits that under the provisions of UCP-600, the L/C issuing Bank, under no circumstances, can stop re-imbursement  as against those bills unless it is directed to do so either by any competent Court or the regulatory authority like Bangladesh Bank. Since, according to him, there is no such restriction, the Sonali Bank, as the L/C issuing bank, has got no legal authority to stop the imbursement after acceptance of those bills and as such it is also the obligation of the Bangladesh Bank to take appropriate regulatory actions against the Sonali Bank to ensure re-imbursement of the said L/C amounts.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Mr. Meah. Mohammd Kawsar Alam, learned Advocate appearing for the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 9305 of 2013, upon adopting the submissions of Mr.  Babul, submits that in respect of both sets of LCs of the petitioner, the L/C issuing banks, namely Krishi Bank and Sonali Bank, issued specific acceptance letters as against the said bills and raised no issue of any discrepancy in respect of the documents submitted by the petitioner in support of actual delivery of the said goods. This being so, he continues, the L/C issuing banks have been acting without legal authority and in violation of the norms and practice of banking—in particular the provisions under UCP-600—the terms of which have been made specifically applicable in respect of the said LC’s by mentioning the same in each L/C. Referring to different Articles of the said UCP-600, in particular Articles-7,  14, 15 and 16, Mr. Alam points out that in issuing the said BB L/Cs the L/C issuing banks accepted the terms and conditions of the UCP-600 and thereby made itself liable to pay once the documents submitted by the supplier are found to be without discrepancy. Since the same were accordingly accepted by the LC issuing banks having found the same without any discrepancy, it is now the legal obligation of the Bangladesh Bank to exercise its regulatory authority upon the L/C issuing banks in view of the provisions under Section 45 and other provisions of the Bank Companies Act, 1991 to ensure strict compliance of the said terms of the UCP-600 for the sake of protection of the reputation of the documentary credits in Bangladesh, he argues. Otherwise, according to him, the commercial world of Bangladesh will internationally suffer a serious blow and loose confidence reposed in it by the international business enterprises. Referring to the resolution of the 362<sup>nd  </sup>Board meeting of the Sonali Bank (Annexure-K to the supplementary affidavit of the petitioner), ACC’s two letters dated 07.04.2014 (Annexure-5 series to affidavit in opposition of respondent No. 3 dated 29.05.2014) and 01.10.2013 (Annexure-I to the supplementary affidavit of the petitioner dated 13.04.2014), Mr. Alam submits that whatever scam-issue was raised by the ACC or the concerned banks at the relevant time, the same have been resolved long ago as the ACC by those letters categorically mentioned that the ACC had nothing to do with the bills of the petitioner and the enquiry in respect of the said bills were already disposed of and that it was the concerned bank’s internal matter as to whether it would re-emburse the said amount as against the said bills. Referring to various decisions of this Court, namely the cases of <strong>Uttara Bank Limited vs. Macklin and Kilburn Ltd., 33 DLR (AD)-298, Standard bank Limited Vs Tripos Engineering, 2005 BLD (AD)-137, Samrat Apparels Vs. Hanvit Bank 57 DLR (AD), 194-196, Gooriyonly (BD) Vs Chartkar holding, 54 DLR (Ad) 2002-71 and Zyta Garments Ltd. Vs Union Bank, 55 DLR (AD0 (2003)-56, </strong>Mr. Alam submits that this Court and the superior Courts of this sub-continent have repeatedly declared that  the Letter of Credit is the blood flow of the commercial world and under no circumstances the same can be disturbed unless the documents are found discrepant or that the bills are the result of fraud.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Mr. Md. Abdul Haque, learned Advocate appearing for the Sonali Bank (respondent No. 3) in Writ Petition No. 5210 of 2013, submits that the country has suffered a huge blow because of the financial scam as perpetrated recently by the Hall Mark group, and this petitioner was also involved in the said scam. In support of his submission, he refers to a letter dated 10.03.2013 (Annexure-2 to the affidavit in opposition dated (21.11.2013) wherein the ACC sought entire documents and papers concerning the Hall Mark group as well as the bills of the petitioner. This being so, Mr. Haque submits that, since the ACC has in the meantime submitted charge sheets against the persons behind such financial scam and the matter is pending before the concerned Courts, the Sonali Bank is entitled to stop the re-imbursement in respect of the said bills as the said bills are the product of fraud and fraudulent activities committed by the petitioner. Mr. Hoque further argues that since the case of the petitioner is in fact for realization of money from the bank and the claim is a disputed claim, this Court should not direct the Sonali Bank to pay the said amount in respect of the said bills as the writ jurisdiction is not the proper forum for resolving such disputes. In support of his submissions, he refers to a decision of our Apex court in <strong>Water Development Board vs. Shamsul Huq, 51 DLR (AD)-169.</strong><br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Opposing the Rule in Writ Petition No. 9305 of 2013, Ms. Hosneara Begum, learned advocate appearing for the Bangladesh Krishi Bank (respondent No. 4), submits that in respect of the said bills the ultimate export to a foreign country was not even done and no foreign exchange was repatriated by the ultimate exporters. This being so, she argues, it is clear that those bills are the product of fraud and as such the Krishi Bank as well as the other LC issuing banks of the said bills are entitled to stop re-imbursement thereon though the same were accepted earlier. Referring to the guidelines of the Bangladesh Bank regarding acceptance of inland bills, Ms. Hosneara submits that the UCP-600 is not applicable in respect of inland bills, rather only the Bangladesh Bank guidelines are applicable, and in accordance with such guidelines, the LC issuing banks as well as the negotiating banks are entitled to conduct enquiry/investigation to determine whether actual supply of goods was made in respect of the said bills. Thus, since in the instant cases such investigation is still going on, this Court should not direct those LC issuing banks to reimburse any amount as against those bills. Further referring to Annuexures-3 and 4 to the affidavit-in-opposition of respondent No. 4, which are two Circulars of Bangladesh Bank dated 11.07.2012 and 09.09.2012, Ms. Hosneara submits that the LC issuing banks as well as the negotiating banks are obliged to comply with the directions as contained in those circulars issued by the regulating authority and in the said circulars it has been clearly provided that unless the banks are satisfied about the real supply of the goods in respect of the inland bills, the same cannot be accepted.<br/> <br/><strong><u>ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS</u></strong>:<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> It appears from the concerned LCs, namely Annexure-B series to the Writ Petition No. 5210 of 2013 and Annexure-L series to the supplementary affidavit of the petitioner dated 18.05.2014 in Writ Petition 9305 of 2013, that each and every BB LCs stipulates therein, in clear terms, the following words:<br/>        </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“.......this documentary credit is subject to uniform customs and practice for documentary credit 2007 (Revision) International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 600......”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>15.</strong> This means, the UCP-600 was made an integral part of the said LCs. Apart from that, we do not see anything in the said LCs that the same would be governed by any separate instruction to be issued by the Bangladesh Bank or already issued by the Bangladesh Bank. This being so, we are unable to accept the submissions as put forward by Ms. Hosneara that UCP-600 will not apply in the concerned LCs, and the instructions as contained in BRPD circulars of Bangladesh Bank will only apply, though, as a statutory regulatory authority, Bangladesh Bank will always have regulatory control over all Banks in Bangladesh.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> Letters of Credit or back to back Letters of Credit are called documentary credits. In such credits, the document prevails over everything else. In this regards, a copy of UCP-600, as placed before us by the learned Advocates deserves some scrutiny and examination by this Court. Under Article-7 of the said UCP-600, it has been provided that the issuing bank must honour the concerned LC, and by issuance of such LC, the issuing bank undertakes to re-emburse a nominated bank that has honoured or negotiated a <u>complying presentation</u> and forwarded the documents to the issuing bank. Article-14 then provides procedure for examination of the documents submitted before the negotiating bank in order to negotiate the said LC, wherein it has been provided that <u>the negotiating bank and the LC issuing bank must examine a presentation to determine <strong>on the basis of the documents alone,</strong> whether or not the documents appear on their face to constitute a complying presentation</u>. Article15 provides that when a confirming bank or negotiating bank determines that a presentation is complying, it must forward the documents to the LC issuing bank. The same Article further provides that <u>when an issuing bank determines that a presentation is complying, it must honour</u>. However, Article-16 confers a right on the issuing bank as well as the negotiating bank not to accept or negotiate LCs once the documents are found not complying, meaning that any discrepancy is found therein. Article-16, however, further provides that if such discrepancy is detected, the purchaser or the applicant of LC may waive such discrepancy, and in that case, the LC issuing bank and the negotiating Bank may accept and negotiate the said LC upon such waiver by the said applicant. <strong>Clause-f of Article-16</strong> is very important in the facts and circumstances of the cases in hand and in the commercial world. The said <strong>Clause-f of Article-16</strong> is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Article-16: </strong><br/><strong>Discrepant Documents, Waiver and Notice</strong><br/><em>“a ...................................</em><br/><em>b...................................</em><br/><em>c....................................</em><br/><em>d....................................</em><br/><em>e.....................................</em><br/><em>f. If an issuing bank or a confirming bank fails to act in accordance with the provisions of this article, <u>it shall be precluded from claiming that the documents do not constitute a complying presentation</u>.</em><br/><em>g......................................” </em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong> Thus, if any discrepancy in the presentation of documents is found, the negotiating bank as well as the LC issuing bank have the right to raise the issue of discrepancy and once such discrepancy is waived by the applicant of the LC, the banks may accept the said LCs. However, according to Clause-f of Article-16, if such discrepancy issue is not raised before, or for <u>any reason the concerned banks fail to act in accordance with the provision of this Article in respect of raising the issue of discrepancy</u>, it cannot subsequently claim that the documents submitted do not constitute complying presentation. It may be noted here that in accordance with the definition of ‘complying presentation’ as provided by Article- 2 of the said UCP-600, <u>a complying presentation means-a presentation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit, the applicable provisions of these rules and international standard banking practice</u>.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> Now, the question is, when, or under what circumstances, an LC issuing bank or a negotiating bank can stop payment or reimbursement as against LCs. In other words, if any investigating agency takes up an inquiry or investigation regarding a financial scam committed by a business group in which some LCs may be involved, whether the concerned bank, on its own volition, can stop payment or reimbursement on a documentary credit.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> The superior Courts of this sub-continent including our Apex court have repeatedly declared that the faith of the clients and depositors in the bank are the utmost important thing in the commercial word. A depositor, when deposits his money in the bank, is entitled to expect that his banker, under any circumstances, will not dishonour his cheque when he has sufficient fund in the account or will not stop him from withdrawing money from his account or transferring the same to another account, unless the banker is directed by a competent court, or in some cases by the regulatory authority like Bangladesh Bank, to stop such payment or transaction. Even if some bills or LCs are the subject matter of any investigation by any agency, we do not find any provision in the relevant laws under which a bank can stop payment or re-imbursement on such LCs. In the present cases as well, we find that the Bangladesh Bank, by its letters dated 06.06.2013 and 22.10.2013 (see Annexure-5 series to the Affidavit in Reply dated 29.05.2014 of respondent No.3) firmly stated the said position of law by saying that even in respect of matters which are under investigation by the ACC it is up to the respective banks to honour or dishonour any bill or make any payment therein <u>in accordance with the banking practice</u>. This Court in a very recent unreported case, namely in Writ Petition No. 4081 of 2012, has re-iterated the said position wherein the operation of bank accounts of Jubilee Bank was stopped by its bankers on the basis of some allegations by some directors of the said bank. In the said case, we specifically directed the Bangladesh Bank to take actions against those banks when those banks were found practicing illegal activities in respect of the depositors money by stopping transactions on their accounts without any order either from the competent court or from the Bangladesh Bank to do so. In another unreported case, namely in Writ Petition Nos. 3958 and 3959 of 2013, a particular amount was transferred from the account of the account holder-petitioner to the government collection account on the ground that the auditors and C.A.G. office raised objection in respect of some payments made in the said account and the said objection was endorsed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee of the Finance Ministry. After discussing relevant provisions of law, this Court again held that no amount of any depositor can be transacted or withdrawn or transferred without consent of the said depositor. In deciding those cases, this Court reiterated the sanctity of the client and banker relationship in the banking business.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> In the cases in hand, we are confronted with almost same scenario, though it may be looked at from different angles. In these cases, the allegation on the basis of which the admittedly accepted BB LCs were not honoured or reimbursed by the LC issuing banks was that those bills were related to the Hall Mark financial scam, the scam that recently jolted the commercial world of this country. To strengthen the said contention, the learned advocates for the banks repeatedly referred to a letter of the ACC dated 18.03.2013 asking the concerned banks to supply copy of certain documents and bills for the purpose of enquiry in respect of the said financial scam. It appears that the concerned banks, accordingly, responded to the said requests of ACC and supplied those documents. However, in such process, the concerned banks, on their own volition, stopped re-imbursement in respect of some admittedly accepted bills including the bills which are the subject matter of the instant writ petitions. Nowhere in the affidavit-in-oppositions or the submissions of the learned advocates of the banks, we find any legal reference or authority on the basis of which they unilaterally stopped re-imbursements as against the said accepted bills, in particular when the Bangladesh Bank in its above mentioned letter dated 22.10.2013 specifically mentioned that even the bills under investigation could be honoured in accordance with the banking practice. Now, when the learned advocates for the petitioners refer to two letters of the ACC, namely the letter dated 07.04.2014 (Annexure-5 series to the affidavit-in-opposition of respondent No. 3 dated 29.05.2014) and letter dated 01.10.2013 (Annexure-I to the supplementary affidavit of the petitioner dated 13.04.2014), whereby  the ACC itself communicated  an information to the concerned banks that the bills in question were no more inquired into and that the concerned banks were at liberty to act in accordance with law and banking practice as regards the re-imbursement against the said bills, the learned advocates for the banks find it difficult to support their standing.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> Again, to strengthen the position of the banks, Ms. Hosneara has tried to rely on two circulars, namely <strong>BRPD Circular No. 10 and 13 dated 11.07.2012 and 09.09.2012 respectively,</strong> issued by the Bangladesh Bank, wherein the Bangladesh Bank emphasized on the need for being assured by the negotiating and LC issuing banks in respect of the actual supply of the goods concerned under the BB LCs or inland bills before giving acceptance thereon. However, we do not see any relevance of those circulars and guidelines of the Bangladesh Bank in respect of the issues raised in the instant writ petitions in particular when the admitted position is that the stage of acceptance of those bills has gone long ago. Therefore, the issue of giving acceptance on the bills is a closed issue now. If the concerned banks are of the opinion that in providing acceptance of the bills the officials of the banks did not strictly comply with the directions, instructions or guidelines issued by the Bangladesh Bank, it is their internal matter and they are at liberty to take appropriate legal actions against those officials. But, we do not find any cogent reason as to how any internal irregularity or illegality committed by any officials of the concerned banks at the relevant time of acceptance of the bills will have any bearing on the re-imbursement of the said bills in particular when the ACC itself has in the meantime observed that it got nothing to do with the said bills.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> We do not know whether the concerned LC issuing banks have stopped re-imbursement on the plea of investigation of the alleged irregularity or illegality at the time of acceptance of the said bills long after such acceptances were given by them just to save the backs of those concerned officials, if any, who were allegedly responsible for violating the circulars or guidelines issued by the Bangladesh Banks. If that is so, this Court cannot allow such practice by any banking enterprise in this country. One cannot suffer the loss for the fault of others. A bank under the law and banking practice, in particular in accordance with the relevant provisions of UCP-600, is bound to make payment or re-imbursement in respect of the accepted bills once they are accepted by the issuing banks, and in view of the said provisions of the UCP-600, namely Article-16, once such acceptance is given, the matter is closed and the concerned banks are precluded from raising any issue thereafter.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> Now, the question of fraud as allegedly committed by the petitioners or that they played a role in the said fraud. Apart from making statements of allegation of fraud or playing a role in the alleged fraud, we have not found any solid steps as taken by the said banks either by asking any investigating agency to inquire in to such allegations or by filing any case before any competent Court against the petitioner. Even if the banks have in the meantime filed any criminal case against the petitioner for commission of such fraud, the payment in respect of the said bills cannot be stopped unless and until the banks obtain an order from a competent Court for stoppage of re-imbursement. Commencing from the Uttara Banks case decided long ago by our Apex Court, this Court has always given high sanctity to the documentary credits as otherwise it would have had serious impact on the international trade. Though the bills in question are inland bills, it cannot be forgotten that they are parts of the international bills, namely that those back to back LCs have been issued under master LCs issued by a foreign purchasers to import some goods or garments from this country. Once this chain of transaction on documentary credits is interrupted without any legal reason, the entire fabric of international trade with Bangladesh will fall apart and the confidence of the international market in the banking transaction of Bangladesh will suffer a huge disaster. This being so, this Court is of the view that  the Bangladesh Bank has a vital role to play in respect of the said bills in view of the provisions of the Bank Companies Act, 1991,  which gave it regulatory power. Under Section 45 of the Bank Companies Act, 1991, the Bangladesh Bank is empowered to give any directions upon any bank or financial institutions for public interest or for the development of banking practice and for the proper management of a concerned bank. However, in this case we are surprised to note that though notice demanding justices by the petitioners were served upon the Bangladesh Bank, it refrained from taking any actions against the concerned LC issuing banks.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> Now, the issue as submitted by the learned Advocate Ms. Hosneara that the goods were ultimately not exported to the foreign country or that the ultimate foreign currency has never repatriated. Since we do not find anything on record in support of such allegation except a mere statement that the foreign currency has never repatriated in respect of those bills, we cannot but hold that even if they are true, those are events long after the acceptance of the concerned bills and as such law will take its own course in respect of those allegations. In so far as the acceptance of the bills is concerned, we do not see any legal authority under which the concerned LC issuing banks can re-open the entire issue merely on the pretext of some investigations and accordingly stop reimbursements on the said accepted bills. It is true that they can investigate their internal irregularities and illegalities at any time they wish, but for such internal investigation a client of the bank cannot suffer when the expectation of the client is that the documentary credit will follow its own law and it will not be impacted upon by any under-lying transactions either between the parties or between the banks or even by any underlying irregularity or illegality committed by the bank officials.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> Again, as regards the submission that the claim of payment of money is a disputed claim, this Court is of the view that evidently the amount of LC is not disputed. What is disputed is the underlying contract regarding supply of the goods. Therefore, we come to the same conclusion that the said underlying dispute has no role to play in so far as the documentary credit is concerned. Though the LCs are inland LCs in a country, it has international impact and that  is why when the banks which are issuing the internal back to back LCs, they are specifically mentioning UCP-600 therein. Since this inland/internal back to back LCs have international  links as the same are connected directly to the confidence of the international players in the commercial world of Bangladesh, this Court should give high priority to such confidence.  This Court is of the view that though initially it was the utmost responsibility of the LC issuing banks to reimburse the amounts as against the said accepted LCs once the same are accepted, it has now become the obligation of the Bangladesh Bank to take appropriate actions against concerned LC issuing banks for their illegal role in stopping re-imbursement against those LCs. Besides, it appears from the Board resolution of the 362nd Board meeting of the Sonali Bank that out of total 116 such inland bills 94 bills were singled out as the same were found to be payable on the basis of its inspection reports. It is also admitted by the affidavit of respondent No. 3-Sonali Bank in Writ Petition No. 9305 of 2012 that the concerned bills in the instant writ petitions are included in the said 94 clean bills.               <br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> Regard being had to the above facts and circumstance of the cases and the relevant law and practice, we are of the view that the Rules have substance and as such the same should be made absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong> In the result, the Rules are made absolute.  The LC issuing banks as well as the Bangladesh Bank are directed to ensure re-imbursement of the said bills of the petitioners by the LC issuing banks (Sonali Bank and Krishi Bank in the aforesaid cases) within a period of two months from receipt of the copy of this judgment. However, since the claims of interests by the petitioners need determination of facts upon adducing evidences, we are not inclined at this stage to direct the respondents to pay any interests. But the petitioners would be at liberty to realize interests, if applicable, through proper forum in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong> Communicate this order.     <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Mozibur Rahman, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong> This Rule was issued, at the instance of petitioner defendant No. 6 calling upon the opposite party plaintiffs Nos. 1-9 to show cause as to why the impugned Order dated 07.03.2013 passed by learned Joint District Judge and Arbitration Adalat, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 4890 of 2008 allowing the application dated 29.07.2012 in part filed by the plaintiff-opposite party Nos. 1-9 under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for correction of deposition and cross examination of P.W. 1 and discharging the plaintiffs from submitting the Memorandum of Understanding should not be set-aside.  <br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Short facts, necessary for disposal of the Rule, is that, the opposite parties No. 1-9 as plaintiffs filed Title Suit No. 4890 of 2008 before the learned District Judge, central filing section, Dhaka against the present petitioner and the opposite parties No. 10-14 impleading them as defendants Nos. 1-6 praying for recovery of khash possession after declaration of title in the suit land shown in the schedule of the plaint. Ultimately the suit was transferred to the Joint District Judge, 7<sup>th</sup> Court (Arbitration Adalat), Dhaka, for disposal.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The defendant Nos. 1-3, 4-5 and 4 and 6 contested the suit by filing three separate written statements and the defendant No. 6 stated in his written statement that the suit is not maintainable in its present form and manner and that the suit has no cause of action. The plaintiffs have not come to the court with clean hand; the plaintiffs filed the suit by suppression of facts; the suit is barred by law of limitation. The suit is bad for defect of parties, the suit is barred by section 42 of the Specific Relief Act; the suit is barred by estoppel, waiver, acquiescence and the plaintiffs have no right, title, interest, owner ship and possession in the suit land. The defendant No. 6 stated that he has been owning and possessing the suit land by way of purchase from its original owner since 1974 to the knowledge of the plaintiffs and other defendants. The defendant No. 6 also mutated the suit land in his name and has been paying the rent and taxes to the Government and City Corporation; that in the city survey the suit land was recorded in the name of the defendant No. 6 vide khatian No. 425, plot No. 3337; that in 1994 the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka and others tried to evict the defendant No. 6 from the suit land claiming it as C.S. Plot No. 380; that challenging the said order of eviction the defendant No. 6 as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 61 of 1994 before the Assistant Judge, 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka for declaration of title and permanent injunction against the Deputy Commissioner and others; that on 28.03.1995 the suit was decreed declaring that the suit land is situated at C.S. Plot No. 376 and that also a decree of permanent injunction was given in the said suit against the Deputy Commissioner and others restraining them from the suit land at C.S. Plot No. 376 in the name of C.S. Plot No. 380; that against the said decree for declaration of title and permanent injunction the Deputy Commissioner and others did not take any steps before the competent court.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> In view of the above plaeadings of the parties to the suit the learned Joint District Judge after framing issues as usual and observing all other legal formalities in this regard made the suit ready for trial. Accordingly, examination in chief of P.W.1 was started on 24.07.2011 and taking long five days it was ended on 08.04.2012. Thereafter P.W. 1 was being cross-examined on and from 27.05.2012 and on 29.07.2012 he stated in cross that a Memorandum of Understanding was executed 15 days before the execution of power attorney Ext.1 between the parties to the suit. On that date i.e. on 29.07.2012 petitioner filed a petition for a direction upon the plaintiff to submit the said Memorandum of Understanding. Learned Joint district Judge after giving both sides an opportunity of being heard allowed the petition directing the plaintiffs to submit the paper as the petitioner prayed for. On the other hand plaintiffs also filed a petition on 27.05.2012 long one year after the conclusion of examination in chief of P.W. 1 praying for correction of deposition made by P.W. 1 and this petition was heard and disposed of on 07.03.2013 allowing the petition for correction of deposition made by P.W. 1 one year ago. At the same time learned trial court exempted the plaintiffs from submitting the Memorandum of Understanding regarding which he passed earlier order to submit it on the basis of the petition of this petitioner defendant no. 6 exercising his inherent power envisaged in section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> After hearing of both the parties, the Joint District Judge and Arbitration Adalat Dhaka, allowed the application of the plaintiffs in part by his impugned judgment and order dated 07.03.2013 correcting the deposition of P.W. 1 which he made one year ago as well as exempting the plaintiffs from submitting the Memorandum of Understanding in contrary to the order he passed earlier on 23.01.2013.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 07.03.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge and Arbitration Adalat, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 4890 of 2008 petitioner moved the instant civil revisional application and obtained the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Mr. Md. Moin Uddin, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the defendant-petitioner, submits that that on 29.07.2012 at the time of cross examination P.W. 1 admitted that সমঝোতা চুওিুপত্র সম্ভবত ১০/০৩/২০০৮ ইং তারিখে স্বাক্ষরিত হয়, এটা রেজিষ্ট্রি হয় নাই। সমঝোতা চুওিু সম্পর্কে আমি কোন ব্যাখ্যা দিব না। সমঝোতা চুওিুপত্র দাখিল করিব প্রয়োজনে। As such, he submits that on the same date the petitioner filed an application for direction upon the plaintiffs to submit  the said সমঝোতা চুওিুপত্র for ends of justice. That on 23.01.2013 the Trial Court heard the both sides and allowed the application given by the petitioner for submitting Memorandum of Understanding. He further submits that the deposition of P.W. 1 was started on 24.07.2011 and ended on 08.04.2012 and cross examination was started on 27.05.2012 one year after the plaintiffs filed application for correction of the deposition of P.W. 1 and that P.W. 1 admitted in cross examination that he got Master Degree in Economics from Dhaka University; that subsequently on 07.03.2013 the Trial Court changed his mind and allowed the application of the plaintiffs given for correction of deposition of P.W. 1 and the learned Court below allowed the petition along with a separate order that plaintiffs are exempted from filing the Memorandum of Understanding in contradiction with his earlier order dated 23.01.2013 and as such the Trial Court committed error of law which is liable to be interfered with.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> In support of his arguments, he cited the following decisions given in the case of Bangladesh Vs. Luxmi Bibi and Ors. Reported in 2BLT (AD) 1994 Page-183, the case of Harun-Or-Rashid and others Vs. Quyum Khan and others reported in 7BLT Page-34, the case of Abdul Noor Vs. Makhan Mia, reported in 60 DLR(AD) 2008, the case of Harun-or-Rashid Vs. Gulaynoor Bibi reported in 19BLC(AD) Page-123. Accordingly, he submits that in pursuance to the decisions given in the cases he referred the present Rule is liable to be made absolute for ends of justice. <br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> Mr. Md. Mostofa, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the plaintiff opposite parties submits that the record of schedule land was prepared on the basis of settlement. But the plaintiff did not file any settlement case. The plaintiff has filed a photocopy of Khatian no. 14, plot no. 2479 of 2010 Joggasola Mouja. On the perusal of the photocopy of this record it appears that 5.00 acre land has been recorded in the name of plaintiff Nurul Islam. The plaintiff has filed some photocopy of rent receipt. The plaintiff did not file original copy of the rent receipt. These photocopies are not acceptable as a document. The plaintiff did not adduce any witnesses and produced any original document to prove the case. With regard to the impugned judgment and order he has clearly stated that the learned Court below did not commit any error of law. <br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> In support of his arguments, he referred the case of Charandwip Bhumihin Krishi Vs. The Cox’s Bazar and others reported in 1988 BLD(AD) page-63. Accordingly, he submits that the Rule issued earlier may be discharged for ends of justice.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> In view of the above facts and circumstances of the case we have perused the Revisional application, impugned order dated 07.03.2013 and other documents/papers as available in record.  It appears from the record that the Trial Court started recording examination in chief of P.W. 1 on 24.07.2011 and ended on 08.04.2012 cross examination of whom was commenced on 27.05.2012 when the plaintiff filed the petition for correction of deposition and cross examination of P.W. 1. After giving both sides an opportunity of being heard he allowed the petition on 07.03.2013 exercising his discretionary power conferred on him under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Now pertinent question in the instant case before us is whether the Trial Court is correct in passing the impugned order dated 07.03.2013 allowing the plaintiffs petition for correction of deposition and cross examination of P.W. 1 as well as discharging the plaintiffs from submitting the Memorandum of Understanding respecting which he earlier allowed an application of the petitioner asking the plaintiffs to submit the said Memorandum of Understanding by his order dated 23.01.2013.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> We have carefully examined the impugned order dated 07.03.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge and found that in exercise of his power conferred on him under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 he has arbitrarily allowed the plaintiffs petition submitted for correction of one year old deposition of P.W. 1. Besides, he has exempted the plaintiffs from filing the memorandum of understanding reversing his own order dated 23.01.2013. It is long settled principle of law that where an alternative remedy exists a party cannot have recourse to the inherent jurisdiction of the court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. But in this case it is clearly seen that Trial Court passed the impugned judgment and order whimsically and arbitrarily without applying his judicial mind allowing the petition for correcting the deposition of the P.W. 1 as prayed for by the plaintiffs. Discretionary power of a court as has been inserted in Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 can not be exercised where alternative remedies are available. After administering oath in the open court when the evidence of a witness is recorded by a trial court it cannot be discarded or changed or corrected in the form of modification except recalling the witness following the prescribed provision of law enunciated in the Evidence Act, 1872.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> In the instant case we have observed that Trial Court did not follow the accurate provision of law in course of passing the impugned order dated 07.03.2013. He has manifestly acted at his own whim and caprice which is neither desirable nor acceptable in the eye of law.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> On perusal of the impugned judgment and order it is further seen that Trial Court passed a suo-motu order exempting the plaintiffs from filing the Memorandum of Understanding in contravention of his earlier order dated 23.01.2013 in strength of which he directed the plaintiff to submit the Memorandum of Understanding on the basis of the application filed by the petitioner defendant. This portion of order passed by the Trial Court is also seen to be injudicious and not consistent with the existing provision of law provided to be applied in this regard as we have cited earlier.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> We have gone through the cases referred by the learned Advocates for both sides as has been stated earlier and found that the facts and circumstances of the case cited by the learned Advocate of the opposite parties are not consistent with that of the instant case before us. <br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> In view of the discussion made above we are of the view that the Trial Court committed an error of law in the impugned order resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and as such the impugned order dated 07.03.2013 passed by the learned Joint District Judge and Arbitration Adalat, Dhaka in Title Suit No. 4890 of 2008 is set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> The order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> Send a copy of this judgment to the court below at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

Pursuant thereto, the concerned Ministry issued a letter under memo dated 7<sup>th</sup> September, 2005,  in  favour of District and Sessions    Judge,  Kishoregonj  to fill up the    vacant posts  of  process  servers.  In   due  course  the  District and Sessions Judge issued a circular in an issue of a national   daily   news   paper   inviting applications   from the  aspiring  candidates  to  fill  up  four  vacant  posts. The writ petitioners thereupon applied to the posts, appeared in the examinations and ultimately they were selected  and  in due course after      receipt  of  appontment letters, they oined in their respective posts  on  15th   January,  2007.  They  were  deputed  to different  courts  by  the  District  Judge  as  process servers  of    Kuliar    Char,  Bagitpur,    Kishoregong    and they   have   been   drawing   their   salary   as   well. After seven  months of  their joining,  they  received  the impugned memo by which   the   District Judge directed them to refund  the  salaries by referring  a letter of the Ministry    of Law, annexure “H’, which read as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">উপর্যুক্ত  বিষয়  এবং সূত্রোল্লিখিত  পত্রের  আলোকে  নির্দেশিত  হয়ে  জানানো  যাচ্ছে  যে, সংসহাপন মন্ত্রণালয়ের ১১/০৫/১৯৯১ খ্রিঃ তারিখের (এসপি)-৪৪/৮৮-২৮৩ নং স্মারকের মর্মানুযায়ী কিশোরগঞ্জ জেলাজজ আদালতের ৫ (পাঁচ) টি শুন্য পদে লোক নিয়োগের বিষয়ে ঘটনা উত্তর/ভূতাপেক্ষে ছাড়পত্র প্রদানের কোন সুযোগ নেই। এ ধরনের কার্যক্রম অনিয়ম ও বিধিবর্হিভূত। এমতাবসহায়, কিশোরগঞ্জ   জেলাজজ আদালতের নিম্নমান সহকারী-কাম- মুদ্রাক্ষরিকের  ১ (একটি)  এবং  জারীকারকের  ৪ (চার)  টি  মোট  ৫টি  শূন্য  পদে  বিগত ১৪/০১/০৭ ইং তারিখে জারীকৃত নিয়োগপত্র বাতিলক্রমে উক্ত পদ সমূহের বিষয়ে পুনরায় ছাড়পত্র গ্রহণ পূর্বক নিয়োগের কার্যক্রম গ্রহনের অনুরোধসহ উল্লিখিত ৫(পাঁচ) টি পদে নিয়োগকৃত ব্যক্তিগণ যদি সরকারী কোষাগার হতে অর্থ   আহরণ করে থাকেন, সে  ক্ষেত্রে তাদের  নিকট  হতে  উক্ত  অর্থ  আদায়  করে  সরকারী  কোষাগারে  চালানমূলে  জমা  দিয়ে চালানের ১(এক) কপি অত্র মন্ত্রনালয়ে প্রেরণের জন্যেও নির্দেশক্রমে অনুরোধ করা হল।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The  High  Court  Division  held  that  the  writ petitioners  were  appointed  after  following  the formalities with prior clearance of the Ministries of Public  Administration; and of  Law  and  Justice;  that  the clearance  letter  of  the Ministry  of  Public Administration   was a product of an  administrative order which   did not say not to initiate  appointment process  by  the  respective department  without  prior approval of clearance of   the    said    Ministry;    that though  the appointment process ought to      have completed  by  30th August, 2006, the     process was initiated  on  25<sup>th</sup> November,  2006  and that the Ministry of Public   Administration’s   memo dated 11<sup>th</sup> May, 1991 was an   administrative order   which   could   not   negate the  right  of  the  writ  petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Learned Deputy Attorney General has assailed the judgment   of   the   High   Court   Division   mainly   on   the ground    that    the    appointments    after    expiry    of    the period  was  without  jurisdiction  and  therefore,  the District and Sessions Judge committed illegality   in  filling      up      the      vacancies      without      taking      fresh clearance  from  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice  again.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Admittedly, the writ petitioners were appointed against  sanctioned  posts  and  under  such circumstances why such clearance  certificate  for  appointment  of  any staff  in    the  judgeship  would  be    necessary    is    not clear  to  us.  There  is  no  existing  law  prohibiting  to make  appointment  against    sanctioned post. On our query, the learned   Deputy   Attorney General   fails   to give   any   explanation   in   this   regard.  The   direction given   by  the Ministry of   Law    and    Justice    is    that since  the  appointments  were   made  after  the   expiry  of the  period  fixed  by  it,  the  appointments were unauthorised.     Before     the High  Court Division  on behalf  of  the  Ministry of  Law  and  Justice  the  learned Deputy   Attorney   General   had   produced   a   Circular of the Ministry of  then  Establishment  Division  dated  22<sup>nd</sup> January, 1998 in support    of  its  claim, which  is reproduced  below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">উপরোক্ত বিষয়ে নির্দেশক্রমে জানানো যাচ্ছে যে, সরকারের সুস্পস্ট নির্দেশ থাকা সত্ত্বেও কোন কোন মন্ত্রণালয়/বিভাগ ও তাদের অধিনস্থ দপ্তর সমূহ তাদের নিয়ন্ত্রনাধীনে বিদ্যমান শুন্য পদ পুরনের পূর্বে সংস্থাপন মন্ত্রনালয়ের পূর্ব অনুমোদন/ছাড়পত্র গ্রহন ছাড়াই কর্মচারী নিয়োগ করে ঘটনা উত্তর অনুমোদন/ছাড়পত্র প্রদান করার জন্য অনুরোধ জানায়। এ ধরনের অনুরোধ সরকারী আদেশ, সার্কুলার ও নির্দেশের প্রতি শামিল এবং এ ধরনের জন্য সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্মকর্তা/কর্মচারীরা সরকারী কর্মচারী (আপীল) বিধি অনুযায়ী ক্ষমতার শাস্তি পাবার যোগ্য।<br/>২। এমতাবসহায় সংশিলস্ট মন্ত্রনালয়/বিভাগ ও তাদের অধীনস্থ দপ্তর সমূহকে এ ধরনের অনিয়ম  বিধি  বর্হিভূত  কার্যক্রম  থেকে  বিরত  থাকার  জন্য পরামর্শ  দেয়া  যাচ্ছে  এবং এখন থেকে  এ  ধরনের  ঘটনা  উত্তর  অনুমোদন/ভূতাপেক্ষ  ছাড়পত্র  গ্রহনের  কোন  প্রসাত ব  অত্র মন্ত্রনালয়ে বিবেচনা না করিবার সিদ্ধান্ত নেয়া হয়েছে। সেমতে এ ধরনের অনিয়ম ও বিধি বর্হিভূত কাজের কোন পুনরাবৃত্তি না ঘটে সেদিকে সংশ্লিষ্ট সকলের সতর্ক দৃষ্টি রাখিতে অনুরোধ জানানো যাচ্ছে।<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.</strong> It   was   pointed out in the  circular  that   despite that  there    was    strict    direction to    obtain prior approval of the Ministry of Public Administration for filling up vacant posts by   the Ministries/Divisions and their  subordinate     departments,  they did not follow the said   direction,   which   is   an   offence.   We fail to understand how this memo is applicable to the subordinate judiciary, inasmuch as, the said circular relates to appointment of staff    against sanctioned posts in different Ministries/ Divisions and their subordinate offices. The lower judiciary is neither a subordinate  department of the Ministry of  Law  and Justice nor the Ministry of Public  Administration. It is under the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.  The Article 109 of the Constitution clearly provides   that “the High Court Division shall have superintendence and control over all courts and tribunals <u>subordinate to it</u>”. (emphasis supplied).   Besides,  article   111 provides  that  ‘The  law  declared  by  the  Appellate Division  shall  be  binding on  the  High  Court  Division and   the   law  declared   by   the   High   Court   Division of the Supreme  Court  shall  be  binding  on  all  courts subordinate  to  it.’  Here  also  in  clear  terms  the question   of   subordination   of   the   District   Courts   has been   mentioned.  These   two   provisions   are   clear  and there is no gainsaying that all District Courts are subordinate to the High Court Division. It is not subordinate to the     Ministry     of  Law  and Justice Department.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> In Mazdar Hossain, 52 DLR (AD) 82,  this  Court  held that the judicial service   has a permanent entity as ‘a separate service   altogether’   and   it   must   always remain   so   in   order   that   Chapter   II   and   VI   is   not rendered nugatory. ‘Functionally and structurally judicial  service  stands  on  a  different  level  from the civil administrative executive   services of the Republic. While the function   of  the civil administrative executive services is to assist the political executive in formulation of policy and in execution   of   the   policy   decisions   of   the   Government of   the   day,   the   function   of   the   judicial   service   is neither    of    them.    It    is    an   independent   arm    of    the Republic which sits on judgment over parliamentary, executive and quasi – judicial actions, decisions and orders.   To   equal   and   to  put   on   the   same   place   the judicial service with civil administrative executive services is  to treat  two  unequals as   equals,’ this court observed. The  independence    of judiciary,  as affirmed and declared by Articles 94(4) and 116A is one  of the basic    pillars of the constitution and cannot be demolished, whittled ground or curtail or demolished of any manner whatsoever, except under the existing provisions of the   constitution. It is to be borne in mind that  the    subordinate staffs of the lower judiciary cannot be dissected with the judicial service. The     judicial officers cannot administer justice  without  the  supporting  staffs. <br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> In the impugned order, annexure “H” to   the  writ petition,  it  was  pointed  out  that  the  appointment was made without jurisdiction   assuming that   the   District Courts   are   under   its   control   and   supervision,   as   if it  is  a  department  under  it. This  is  based  on  a  wrong premise and  on  misconception  of  law.  Under no stretch of imagination,  the   Ministry   of Law  and   Justice   can legally    give    such    direction to the District  and Sessions  Judge.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> In    course    of    hearing,    learned    Deputy    Attorney General   has   drawn   our   attention   to   two   circulars   of the then Ministry of Establishment Division, one under  memo  dated  15th March,  1992  and  the  other  dated 17<sup>th</sup> January,  2000.  The  circular  dated  15th   March,  1992 is  as  under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"উপর্যুক্ত   বিষয়   ও সূত্রের   বরাতে   আদিষ্ট   হইয়া   জানানো   যাইতেছে   যে, মন্ত্রণালয়/বিভাগ ও ইহার অধীনস্থ দপ্তর সমূহে বিদ্যমান সকল প্রকার (সরাসরি ও পদোন্নতির মাধ্যমে পূরণ যোগ্য) শূন্যপদ পুরণের পূর্বে সংস্থাপন মন্ত্রনালয় হইতে ছাড় পত্র গ্রহণের যে নির্দেশাবলী জারি করা হইয়াছিল সেই গুলি পরীক্ষা করিয়া সিদ্ধান্ত গৃহীত হইয়াছে যে,  এখন হইতে পদোন্নতির মাধ্যমে পূরণ যোগ্য পদসমূহ পূরণের ক্ষেত্রে ছাড় পত্রের প্রয়োজন হইবে না।<br/>২। অতএব, মন্ত্রাণলয় ও বিভাগ সমূহকে এখন হইতে ছাড়পত্র গ্রহণের প্রসাত ব প্রেরণের সময় কেবলমাত্র সরাসরি নিয়োগের মাধ্যমে পূরণযোগ্য শূন্য পদসমূহ পূরণের ক্ষেত্রে সংস্থাপন মন্ত্রণালয়ের ছাড়পত্র গ্রহণের জন্য অনুরোধ করা যাইতেছে।<br/>৩। সরকারি নি©র্দশানুসারে সংস্থাপন মন্ত্রণালয়ের পূর্বানুমোদন/ছাড়পত্র গ্রহণ ব্যতিরেকে সরাসরি নিয়োগের মাধ্যমে পূরণযোগ্য শূন্যপদ পূরণ করা হইলে তাহা বিধি সম্মত হইবে না বিধায় এইরুপ অবৈধ ভাবে নিয়োগ প্রাপ্ত কর্মচারীদের বেতন পরিশোধ না করিবার জন্য সংশিলষ্ট প্রধান/জেলা হিসাবরক্ষণ কর্মকর্তাগণকে অনুরোধ জানানো যাইতেছে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/>The  circular  dated  17<sup>th</sup> January,  2000  is  as  under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘প্রশাসনিক পুনর্বিন্যাসের কারণে উদ্বৃত্ত কর্মচারী আত্মীকরণ এবং ভীবষ্যত সম্ভাব্য প্রশাসনিক  পুনর্বিন্যাস  এর  জন্য  শূন্যপদ সংরক্ষণের নিমিত্ত  সকল মন্ত্রণালয়, অধিদপ্তর, পরিদপ্তর এবং  তদাধীনস্থ দপ্তর সমূহ ও সকল স্বায়ত্তশাসিত, আধা  স্বায়ত্তশাসিত সংস্থা সমূহের রাজস্বখাতভুক্ত পদ সরাসরি নিয়োগের মাধ্যমে পূরণের ক্ষেত্রে সংস্থাপন মন্ত্রণালয়ের ছাড়  পত্র গ্রহণের  পদ্ধতি  প্রচলিত  আছে।  তবে  নিমণবর্ণিত  পদগুরেলার  ক্ষেত্রে সংস্থাপন মন্ত্রণালয়ের ছাড় পত্রের প্রয়োজন হয় নাঃ-</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(ক) ক্যাডার সার্ভিসভুক্ত সকল পদ।<br/>(খ) প্রতিরক্ষা কর্মবিভাগের বেসামরিক কর্মচারী ব্যতীত সকল পদ।<br/>(গ) বি ডি আর, আনসার এবং পুলিশ বাহিনীর সকল পদ, বাহিনী বহির্ভূতসহায়ক এবং করনিক কর্মচারীর পদ ব্যতীত।<br/>(ঘ) স্বায়ত্বশাসিত সংস্থার আওতাধীন ন্যাশনালাইজড এন্টারপা্র ইজ সমূহের সকল পদ, যেমনঃ মিল কারখানাসমূহ পরিচালনার সাথে সংশ্লিষ্ট পদ সমূহ।<br/>(ঙ) সরকার  পরিচালিত  আর্থিক  প্রতিষ্ঠানসমূহ  যথা:  ব্যাংক,  বীমা,  ইনভেস্টমেন্ট কর্পোরেশন এবং হাউস বিল্ডিং ফাইন্যান্স কর্পোরেশন ইত্যাদি।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">২। সরকারের  আকার  সীমিতকরণ,  ব্যয়  সংকোচন  এবং ভবিষ্যৎ  প্রশাসনিক  পুনর্বিন্যাসের লক্ষে ১৯৯৪ সাল ইতে উপর্যুক্ত ক্ষেত্রে মঞ্জুরিকৃত পদের ২০% শূন্যপদ সংরক্ষনের নীতিমালা অনুসরন করা হচ্ছে।<br/>৩।  ২০০৬ সালের  মধ্যে  দেশকে  নিরক্ষরতা  মুক্তকরণ  এবং  প্রাথমিক  ও মাধ্যমিক  শিক্ষা কার্যক্রমকে   জোরদার  করার  লক্ষ্যে  সংস্থাপন  মন্ত্রণালয়ের  ছাড়  পত্র গ্রহণের  বাধ্যবাধকতা হতে  অব্যাহতি  প্রদানের  সরকারি  সিদ্ধামেরত প্রেক্ষিতে  এখন  হতে  নিম্নবর্ণিত  পদ পূরণে সংস্থাপন মন্ত্রণালয়ের ছাড়পত্র গ্রহণের প্রয়োজন হবে না।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 80px;">(ক) সরকারী প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ের প্রধান শিক্ষক পদ।<br/>(খ) সরকারী মাধ্যমিক ও প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ের সহকারী শিক্ষক পদ।<br/>(গ) থানা শিক্ষা অফিসার পদ।<br/>(ঘ) সহকারী থানা শিক্ষা অফিসার পদ।</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৪।  শূন্যপদ  পূরণের  ক্ষেত্রে  ইতঃ  পূর্বে  জারিকৃত  সকল  আদেশ  নির্দেশ  এই  সংশোধনী সাপেক্ষে কার্যকর থাকবে।"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>10.</strong> In the first circular it was mentioned   that to reserve the vacant posts   for   absorbing   the   surplus employees due to    administrative    rearrangement and future probable administrative rearrangements usually sanction   from   Ministry of   Establishment   is   required to fill-up the posts under government revenue through direct appointment  of  every  Ministry,  Department, Section and all sections under those offices and all autonomous, semi-autonomous organizations. But no such  sanction  is necessary for  the following  posts:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align:justify">All  posts under  cadre  service</li><li style="text-align:justify">All  post of  defence  except  civil  employees</li><li style="text-align:justify">All post of nationalized  Enterprise    under Autonomous  institutions</li><li style="text-align:justify">All posts of BDR,  Ansar  And    police Force except  Assistant outside     from the   force and clerk.</li><li style="text-align:justify">All Government running  Financial  Institutions, for example: Bank,  Insurance,  Investment Corporation    and    House Building Finance Corporation  etc. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11.</strong> This  letter  also  does  not  apply  to  the  lower judiciary, inasmuch as, the lower   judiciary is not under the control and  superintendence of  the  Ministry of Law     and  Justice  Department.  In the latter circular,   it   was   mentioned   that   there   was   provision for  prior  permission  of  the  Ministry  of  Establishment for  appointing employees  against  vacant  posts.  It, however,  observed  that  the  Ministries’  prior  approval would  not  be necessary in case of filling up  the vacancies   in   respect   of   the   post   of   cadre   service. All posts of Ministries of Defence other than civil employees of   BDR,   Ansar   and   Police   Department other than  clerical  posts  and  some  other  organizations.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> A close  reading of the latter circular   clearly shows   that   it   was   written   with   a   view to minimizing the manpower of the government employees working in different   Ministries   and   departments,   cost   reduction and also   with   a   view   to   keeping   20%   vacant posts reserved for future  administration    reorganizations. So apparently this circular is also not applicable, inasmuch  as,  apart  from  the   fact  as  mentioned  above, there   is   no   scope   for   reorganization  of   the   lower judiciary  in  future.  The functions  of  the  lower judiciary are altogether different from civil administrative   service.   Naturally,   this   circular   has no  manner  of  application  for  filling  up  the  vacancies in  the  lower  judiciary  against  sanctioned  posts.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Apart   from   the   above,   for   proper   administrative and  control  of  the  lower  judiciary,  the  Judges  of  the High  Court  Division  and  Chief  Justice  usually  inspect the  lower  courts  every  year.  In  course  of  their inspections   it   is   found   that   in   all   district   courts the   smooth   functioning   and   transacting   its   business are being hampered due to shortage of staff against sanctioned  posts  due  to  retirement  and  appointment process   could   not   be   initiated   due   to   these circulars.  With  the  increase  of  the  population  day  by day,   the   pace   of   filing   litigations   is   also increasing   threefold.   It   is   reported   by   the   Judges that whenever they writ letters for clearance for appointment    of  staff    against    sanctioned    posts,    the reply of  the  Ministry  comes  at  a  belated  stage- sometimes  it   takes   one   year   or   more. Naturally this hampers the   administration   of   justice,   inasmuch   as, unless  the  supporting  staffs  help  the  Judges,  it will be  difficult  for  them  to  administer  justice.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> There  are  shortage  of  Judges  in  every  courts  and even under  the present  strength,    the    subordinate staffs  cannot  manage  the    sections  due to shortage with  the  result  that  even  after  working  extra  times, they  cannot   coup   with   the   situation.   The   net   result is  that  the  docket  is  increasing  every  day.  The litigants’ sufferings are mounting in     obtaining copies and taking steps in pending litigations. Cases cannot  be  made    ready    due    non-service    of    summons. There   is   urgent   need   to   increase   at   least   twice   the present  number  of  manpower  working  in  the  lower judiciary. The   Bench Assistants     who are called ‘Packers’ are   so  overworked    that    they   unofficially engaged ‘Umeders’ to write order sheets by making payments  from  their  own  pocket.  As  soon  as  this  fact has   been   published   in   the   media,   the   Chief   Justice issued  circular   directing   the   District   and   Sessions Judges   not   to   allow   any   outsider  to work   with   the Bench   Assistants.   Now   that   ‘Umeders’   are   not   working and  as  a  result,  the  Bench  Assistants  are  working  in the   courts   of   the   District   and   Sessions Judges, the Chief Judicial Magistrates, Chief Metropolitan Magistrates, more  than     12  hours a  day. These supporting  staff  are  not getting  any over  time and  it is  not  humanly  possible  for  them  to  manage  more  than hundred cases  a  day  and  to  write  orders  in  the  order sheet.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> So   the   number   of   Bench   Assistants   particularly working  in  busy  districts  like  Dhaka,  Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Bogra, Comilla, Mymensingh, Jessore, Barisal, Comilla, Noakhali,  Rajshahi,  Dinajpur  should be increased to two so that   the  administration   of justice can function smoothly.  Accordingly,  it is imperative to take immediate steps by the Ministries of  Public Administration,  and  Law  and  Justice  to increase at least one the more Bench Assistant to the District and Sessions Judges, Chief Metropolitan Magistrates,  Metropolitan  Sessions  Judges,  Nari-O-Shishu Nirjatan Daman Tribunals, Chief Judicial Magistrates   in   all   old   District   Courts.   It   is   hoped that  the  said  Ministries  shall  take  immediate  step  in this  regard.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> The Ministry of  Public  Administration’s  circulars under   memo   dated   15th    March,   1992,   11th    May,   1991   and 17th  January, 2000 are not applicable to the District Courts.   Henceforth,   the   District Courts  will   be   at liberty  to  take  immediate  step  to  fill  up  the  vacant sanctioned posts for smooth functioning of the courts without taking  prior  approval  or    clearance  from Ministry of  law  and  Justice as well as the Ministry of Public Administration. The said circulars are not applicable to the   lower judiciary. The Ministry of Public    Administration is  directed to withdraw   the aforesaid circulars immediately and intimate this court. Let a copy of the judgment be communicated to the Ministries of Public Administration, and Law and Justice.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> This  petition  is  disposed of  with  the    above directions  and  observations.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Billal Hossain Mallik, joined the police department as Sub-Inspector of Police on 10.01.1987. Subsequently, he was promoted to the post of Inspector of Police on 21.12.1993. While he was serving as the Inspector of Police under Khulna Range, the authority pressed a charge sheet against him on 19.07.1999 on the allegation of misconduct. The petitioner-respondent denied the charge and claimed innocence. After that, appellant No.2 passed the impugned order dated 09.09.1999 reducing the petitioner-respondent to the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police under section 5(e) of the Police Officers (Special Provision) Ordinance, 1976. Being aggrieved, the petitioner-respondent preferred a departmental appeal on 19.09.1999 and the same was rejected on 26.01.2000.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Against the order of rejection dated 26.01.2000 passed by the concerned departmental authority, the petitioner-respondent filed Administrative Tribunal Case No. 70 of 2000 (old) renumbered as Administrative Tribunal Case No.141 of 2003 (New) before the learned Member, Administrative Tribunal No.2, Dhaka,<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The respondents-appellants contested the case by filing written objection denying all the material statements made in the application filed before the Administrative Tribunal, contending, inter alia, that on the basis of convincing materials on record, the impugned penalty was rightly awarded to the petitioner-respondent and as such, the impugned order of punishment suffered from no legal infirmity to call for any interference by the Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The Administrative Tribunal by its decision dated 10.08.2004 allowed the case of respondent on setting aside the order dated 09.09.1999 reducing the petitioner-respondent to the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police from the rank of Inspector of Police.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the decision dated 10.08.2004 passed by the learned Member, Administrative Tribunal, Dhaka, the appellants preferred Appeal No.51 of 2005 before the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka. The Administrative Appellate Tribunal, upon hearing the parties, by its decision dated 26.01.2010 dismissed the appeal on contest affirming the decision of the Administrative Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> The relevant facts for the purpose of disposal of Civil Appeal No.21 of 2012, in a nutshell, are:<br/>        <br/>         The respondent herein, Md. Tareque Kamal joined Bangladesh Police as Sub-Inspector of Police on 27.03.1990 and subsequently, he was promoted to the post of Inspector for his satisfactory service. While the respondent had been serving as the Officer-in-Charge at Savar Police Station, Dhaka, appellant No.2 herein most illegally placed the respondent under suspension on 11.01.2005 and served a notice upon him for showing cause on 01.12.2005 under the provision of the Police Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1976 (in short, the Ordinance). In that notice, it has been alleged that the respondent committed offence under section 4(I),(II)(IV)and (VII)of the Ordinance for misconduct, dereliction of duty, corruption and inefficiency. The respondent submitted his reply denying all the allegations under the charge. Appellant No.2 not being satisfied with the written reply of the respondent served provisional order on 09.01.2006 proposing major penalty of dismissal from service. The respondent submitted his reply in time claiming innocence. But appellant No.3 most illegally and arbitrarily passed the final order of dismissal of the respondent from service on 24.01.2006. The respondent preferred an appeal to appellant No.1 on 30.01.2006 but getting no response from the appellate authority, the respondent filed the case before Administrative Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> The appellant herein contested the case by filing written objection denying all the material statements made in the application filed before the Administrative Tribunal. Their case, in short, is that the impugned order dismissing the respondent from service was rightly passed and there was no necessity of consultation with the Public Service Commission in awarding punishment to the respondent under the said Ordinance. There was no illegality or irregularity in the proceeding. As such, the case is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> The Administrative Tribunal by its decision dated 23.04.2008 allowed the case of the respondent and directed the appellants to reinstate the respondent in service from the date of his suspension with all attending benefits.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the decision dated 23.04.2008 passed by the learned Member, Administrative Tribunal, Dhaka, the appellants   preferred Appeal No.67 of 2008 before the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka. The Administrative Appellate Tribunal, upon hearing the parties, by its decision dated 04.03.2010 dismissed the appeal on contest affirming the decision of the Administrative Tribunal.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the decisions respectively passed by the Administrative Appellate Tribunal, Dhaka, the respondents as the leave-petitioners have filed Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos.1433 of 2010 and 1555 of 2010 before this Division and obtained leave respectively in both the civil petitions on 08.01.2012 and 11.12.2011, resulting in Civil Appeal Nos.17 and 21 of 2012.   <br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> Mr. Goutam Kumar Roy, learned Deputy Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the appellants of both the appeals, submits that the Administrative Appellate Tribunal failed to appreciate that as per section 3 of the Police Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance,1976 no consultation is necessary with Public Service Commission (PSC) and as such, the decision of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal affirming the decision of the Administrative Tribunal should be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Mr. Abdur Rob Chowdhury, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the respondent of in both the appeals, on the other hand, submits that before imposing major penalty upon a class-I and Class-II Government Officers, the authority must consult the Public Service Commission and as the impugned decision does not call for any interference.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> We have considered the submissions of the learned Deputy Attorney General for the appellants of both the appeals and the learned Senior Advocate for the respondent of both the appeals, perused the impugned judgment and the materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> Before entering into the merit of the appeals, it is necessary to go through the common grounds, for which, leave was granted. The grounds are quoted below:</div><ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman"><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether both the Administrative Appellate Tribunal and the Administrative Tribunal failed to appreciate that the authority which framed charge against the respondent and eventually awarded the impugned penalty was the controlling authority of the respondent at that time and as such the decision of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal affirming the decision of Administrative Tribunal is liable to be set aside.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether both the Administrative Appellate Tribunal and the Administrative Tribunal failed to appreciate that as per section 3 of the Police Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1976 no consultation is necessary with the Public Service Commission and as such the decision of the Administrative Appellate Tribunal affirming the decision of the Administrative Tribunal should be set aside. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>18.</strong> Admittedly, the respondents of both the appeals were dismissed from service by imposing the major penalty on them. The question to be resolved in these appeals is whether before awarding the punishment of dismissal from service consultation with the Public Service Commission is necessary. Admittedly, in both the appeals no consultation was made with the Public Service Commission before awarding punishment of dismissal from service.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> In order to resolve this issue, it is necessary to go through section 3 of the Police Officers (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1976. Section 3 runs as follows:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“3. This Ordinance shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any law, rules and regulations relating to police-force nor shall prejudice the operation of any other law, rules and regulations including the service conditions of the said police-force.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong> Having gone through the section, it appears that this section in no uncertain terms states that the provision of this Ordinance shall have effect notwithstanding enjoying contained in any law, rules and regulations relating to the Police Service but at the same time this section also states that this Ordinance shall not prejudice the operation of any other law, rules and regulations including the service conditions of the said police officers.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> Regulation 6 of the Bangladesh Public Service Commission (Consultation) Regulation, 1979 states that it shall not be necessary to consult the Commission in any disciplinary matter except before passing any order of imposing the penalty of removal, dismissal, compulsory retirement from service, or reduction in rank of a class-I and Class-II Gazetted Officer. Considering regulation 6, it appears that before passing any order of imposing penalty of removal, dismissal, compulsory retirement from service, or reduction in rank of a Class-I and Class-II Gazetted Officer consultation with Public Service Commission is mandatory.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> On consideration of section 3 of the Ordinance vis-a-vis regulation 6 of the Regulations, it is obvious that consultation with Public Service Commission is mandatory before passing the order of dismissal in respect of each of the respondent as section 3 of the Ordinance has not ousted the operation of other laws, rules and regulations.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> Admittedly, the respondents of both the appeals were Class-II officers. When they were dismissed from service, no consultation was made with Public Service Commission. Because of this inherent defect in the orders of dismissal of both the respondents, we are of the view that the impugned decisions were passed in accordance with law.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> In this connection, reliance may be placed on the case of <strong><em>Government of Bangladesh vs. A.A.M. Salakuzzaman and another (2000)5 MLR (AD)281</em></strong>, in which, it has been held that before imposing major penalty upon Class-I or Class-II Government officer, the authority must consult the Public Service Commission. The opinion of the Public Service Commission is not binding upon the Government which can take contrary view in an appropriate case.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> Having gone through the case cited above it appears that the consultation with the Public Service Commission is mandatory before passing the orders of dismissal of both the respondents though the opinion of Public Service Commission is not binding on the authority.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> In the light of the finding made before, we do not find substance in these appeals. Accordingly, both the appeals are dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

When a provision is withdrawn from a section, the legislature calls the Act an amendment particularly when a provision is added to replace the one withdrawn. However, when a section is abrogated and no new section is added to replace it, legislature level the Act accomplishing the result a repeal.         . . . (10)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>State Acquisition and Tenancy </strong><strong>Act, 1950 (XXVIII of 1951)</strong><br/><strong>Section 86</strong><br/><strong>The right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor shall subsist in the land from the date of substitution of section 86 if the land diluviated re-appear within thirty years from that date. The legislature is totally silent as regards the operation of the substituted provision by Act XV of 1994, whether this provision will have prospective or retrospective effect but we find no ambiguity in the language used in it. It is said ‘the right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist.....’ The legislature has used the word ‘shall’ that is, the right of the tenant shall subsist in respect of diluviated land if such land re-appear within thirty years of </strong><strong>loss, that is to say, if the re-appearance of the</strong><strong> diluviated land takes place in future. Under the previous provision limited retrospective operation was given to the loss of land by diluvion which ‘took’ place before the commencement of the substituted provision but under the present provision, such language was deliberately omitted.          . . . (33)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>Interpretation of Statute</strong><br/><strong>When on a plain reading of the provision it is found that the tenant’s right, title and interest shall subsist on the diluviated land if such land re-appear within thirty years of their loss, there is no scope for the courts to infer otherwise. They cannot enlarge and/or give a wider meaning of the words when they are clear and unambiguous. It is the fundamental rule of law that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation unless such constitution appears very clearly in the terms of Act or arises by necessary implication. The use of the words ‘shall’ or ‘hereafter’ is taken to indicate an intent that the statute is to be construed as prospective only. It can be stated generally that an Act prima facie deals with future and not with past events.          . . . (36)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>State Acquisition and Tenancy </strong><strong>Act, (XXVIII of 1994)</strong><br/><strong>Section 86(2)</strong><br/><strong>Section 86(2) provides that the right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist in the land of a holding or a portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion if such land re-appear ‘within thirty years of their loss’. This provision ensures the subsistence of the right, title and interest of the original tenant in the land lost by diluvion if the lands so lost re-appear within thirty years of loss notwithstanding the abatement of rent of such lands. . . .(39)</strong><br/> <br/><strong>State Acquisition and Tenancy (Amendment)</strong><strong> Act, (XXVIII of 1994)</strong><br/><strong>Section 86(2)</strong><br/><strong>In view of the use of the words, ‘the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist’ during the period of loss if the land re-appear in situ within thirty years of loss is so clear and unambiguous that the legislature intended this provision to have prospective operation. The use of the word ‘shall’ is taken to indicate that the statute is to be construed as prospective only. The words ‘within thirty years of loss’ means if the diluvion takes place after  13th  July,  1994, the tenant  or  his  successor’s right  to re-possession shall subsist if the diluviated land re-appear within thirty years of loss and not otherwise. The amendment is prospective in operation and the High Court Division is not correct in giving retrospective operation of the substituted provision of sub-section (2) of section 86 of the Act of 1950. . . .

The question involves in this appeal is whether the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist in the land or a portion thereof which were diluviated  prior to the substitution of section 86 of the State Acquisition  and Tenancy Act, 1950, by the State Acquisition and Tenancy (Amendment)  Act (Act XV of 1994) if the land re-appear <em>in situ </em>within thirty years of their loss, which came into effect on 13th July, 1994, or in the alternative, whether the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor-in-interest shall extinguish in the said land in the process of loss by diluvion prior to the date of commencement of the substituted provisions of section 86 of the Act, 1950 but the said land re-appear <em>in situ </em>within thirty years from 13th July, 1994.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Short facts which are relevant for the disposal of this point are as under:<br/><br/>         The respondent claimed that his ancestral land situated on the bank of Padma under Faridpur district were diluviated in 1947 and then he shifted to Mouja Charbhadrason, withinFaridpur District in 1948. Subsequently he shifted to Jhaukanda, Dohar, under Dhaka district by purchasing  some land in 1956 due to diluvion of the said land. These  land were also diluviated by the river Padma in 1991. He purchased some land in Dohar which were also diluviated in 1992. The Secretary of the Ministry of Land communicated a memorandum upon all the Deputy Commissioners directing them to take steps in respect of the land which were diluviated/reformed <em>in situ </em>stating that the substituted provision of section 86 by Act XV of 1994 would be prospective  in operation and that the new provision would not be applicable in respect of those land which were diluviated and alluviated prior to that date, that is to say, the said land would be treated as khas land of the Government in accordance with the old provision. To appreciate the point, it is necessary to reproduce the said memorandum which is as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The State Acquisition and Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1994 সংসদ কর্তৃক গৃহীত আইনটি ১৩ই জুলাই তারিখে মহামান্য রাষ্ট্রপতির সম্মতি লাভ করেছে এবং বাংলাদেশ গেজেটে প্রকাশিত হয়েছে। উক্ত তারিখ থেকে আইনটি কার্যকর বলে গন্য করতে হবে। তাই, ১৩ই জুলাই/৯৪ এর পুর্বদিন পর্যমত্ম যে সমসত্ম জমি সিকসি/ত্ম পয়সিত্ম হয়েছে ঐ জমির ক্ষেত্রে এই আইন কার্যকর নয় বলে গন্য করতে হবে। অর্থাৎ ১৩/৭/১৯৯৪ তারিখের পুর্বে যখনই সিকসিত্ম বা পয়সিত্ম হোক না কেন  সে ধরনের জমির ক্ষেত্রে এই আইন প্রযোজ্য হবে না বরং পুর্বতন আইন মোতাবেক ঐ জমি সরকারের খাস  খতিয়ান  ভুক্ত হবে।  তদানুসারে  সকল  জেলা  প্রশাসককে  কার্যকর  ব্যবসহা  গ্রহনের  নির্দেশ  দেয়া হলো।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>3.</strong> The respondent sought judicial review of the said memorandum. The High Court Division held that ‘the impugned order in respect of land which re-appeared (alluviated) prior to 13th July 1994 will vest in the Government and that the Act XV of 1994 was not applicable to such land ..... the impugned order ‘Annexure D’ to that extent’ and gave a direction that ‘all lands diluviated prior to 13th  July, 1994, will vest in the Governments and that the Act XV of 1994 was not applicable to such lands in diluvion to be illegal and without lawful authority.’ However, in the operating part of the judgment the High Court Division declared that ‘the order directing to treat all lands diluviated prior to 13th July, 1994 to have vested in the  Government.’  It  appears  to  us  that  the  High  Court  Division  has  made  inconsistent observations and directions which require to be clarified for the interest of the riparian cultivators.  The  question  involves  is  one  of  interpretations  of  section  86  of  the  State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950 (the Act of 1950).<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> In defining the role of the court in interpreting a statute, Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th Edn. page 132, stated:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The duty of the judicature is to discover and to act upon the true intention of the legislature-the <em>mens or sententia legis. </em>The essence of the law lies in its spirit, not in its letter, for the letter is significant only as being the external manifestation of the intention that underlines it. Nevertheless in all ordinar y cases the courts must be content to accept the <em>lietera legis </em>as the exclusive and conclusive evidence of the <em>sententia  legis</em>.  They must in  general  take  it absolutely for granted that the legislature has said what it meant, and meant what it has said. <em>Ita scriptum est </em>is the first principle of interpretation. Judges are not at liberty to add to or take from or modify the letter of the law, simply because  they  have  reason  to  believe  that  the  true  <em>sententia  legis  </em>is  not completely or correctly expressed by it”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Bennion on ‘Understanding Common Law Legislation stated that the court is to read a provision of a statute in its context which includes other provisions of the statute and to see if on reading  of the statute  in its context  the  language  appears  to be vague,  ambiguous  or equivocal needing interpretation. A statute should be given an informed construction taking into account its context and the court is to find the legal meaning of the provisions of the statute which corresponds to the original legislative intention. Where the literal construction would not further the purpose of the legislature literal meaning is to be departed from even though there is no ambiguity or vagueness and a construction which accords with the purpose of the legislation  should be given. When the language of an enactment  is ambiguous and admits of more than one meaning, then the court is to find out which one of the meaning is in accord with the legislative intent and that meaning is the legal meaning. But when the literal meaning  is found  to be contrary to the purpose  of the  legislation,  the  court  is to give  a purposive construction which accords with the purpose of the legislation and for that purpose modify the language used in the enactment.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> In order to find out the object and purpose of an enactment, the courts are entitled to find the intention of the legislature and its purpose and give meaning of the words to further the same so as to suppress the mischief and further just and fair results. Statutes have to be construed in a manner so as to promote the purpose and its object, and not too literally so as to defeat the purpose or render the provision meaningless otiose. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. In Holme V. Guy, (1887) 5 Ch.D. 901, Sir George Jessel MR. said, ‘The court is not to be oblivious of the history of law and legislation.’ Following a passage from Maxwell, Supreme Court of India in Kesavananda Bharati V. State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461 (1879) observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“In this interpretation of statutes the interpreter may call to his aid all those external  or  historical  facts  which  are  necessary  for  comprehension  of  the subject matter, and may also consider whether a statute was intended to alter the law or to leave it exactly where it stood before. But although we can have in mind the circumstances when the Act was passed and the mischief which then existed so far as these are common knowledge .....”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The Supreme Court of India in this connection in Nasiruddin V. Sita Ram, AIR 2003 SC 1543 observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The Court’s jurisdiction to interpret a statute can be invoked when the same is ambiguous. It is well known that in a given case the Court can iron out the fabric. It cannot change the texture of the fabric. It cannot enlarge the scope of legislation or intention when the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous. It cannot add to or subtract words to a statute or read something into it which is not there.  It cannot re-write or recast legislation. It is also necessary to determine that there exists a presumption that the Legislature has not used any superfluous words. It is well settled that the real intention of the legislation must be gathered from the language used”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>8.</strong> The most fair and rational method for interpreting a statute is by exploring the intention of the legislature  through the most natural and probable signs which are either words, the context, the subject matter, the effects and consequences, or the spirit and reason of the law. In the court of law what the legislature intended to be done or not to be done can only be legitimately ascertained from that what it has chosen to enact, either in express words or by reasonable and necessary implication. When the legislative intent finds specific mention and expression in the provisions of the Act itself, the same cannot be whittled down or curtailed and rendered nugatory by giving undue importance to the so-called object underlying the Act. True intent of the legislature has to be gathered and deciphered in its proper spirit having due regard to the language used therein. (Keshavji Raviji V. Commissioner of Income Tax, AIR, 1991 SC 1806). The primary object in interpreting a statute is always to discover the intention of the legislature and the rules of interpretation developed in England can be relied on to aid the  discovery  because  those  whose  task  it  is  to  put  the  intention  of  the  legislature  into language,  fashion their language with those very rules in view. Crawford  in his Statutory Construction at page 506 stated “The court should study it as a whole and even if it resorts to a reasonable  or  liberal  construction,  care  should  be  taken  not  to  defeat  the  intention  of legislature”.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> Previous legislation may also be relevant to the interpretation of latter statute in two ways- (a) the course which legislation on a particular point has followed often provides an indication as to how the Act at present should be interpreted; and (b) light may be thrown on the meaning of a phrase in statute by reference to the specific phrase in an earlier statute dealing with same   subject   matter.   Lord Halsbury in  Eastman   Photographic   Co.   V. Comptroller General of Patents (1898) A.C. 571(575) said ‘To construe the statute now in question it is not only legitimate but highly convenient to refer both to the former Act and to the ascertained  evils to  which the former  Act had given rise, and to the later Act which provided  the  remedy’.  In  this  connection  the  author  of  Craies  on  Statute  Law,  Seventh Edition, at page 126 said, the cause and necessity of the Act may be discovered,  first, by considering the state of the law at the time when the Act was passed. In innumerable cases the courts, with a view to construing an Act, have considered the existing law and reviewed the  history of legislation  upon the subject.  ‘While  we are to  collect  what  the  legislature intended from what it has said, we must look not at one phrase or one section only at the whole of the Act, and must read it by the light which the state of the law at the time ... throws upon it’. (SE RY V. The Railway Commissioners (1880)5 QB 217(240).<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> When a section  is being added  to  an Act  or  a provision  added  to  a section,  the legislature commonly entitled the Act as an amendment. When a provision is withdrawn from a section, the legislature call the Act an amendment particularly when a provision is added to replace the one withdrawn.  However,  when a section  is abrogated  and no new section is added to replace it, legislature level the Act accomplishing the result a repeal. Southerland in this connection observed as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“In interpreting an amendatory Act, the courts have followed the principles of construction used in the interpretation of an original Act, making special use of certain principles of interpretation particularly applicable to an amendatory Act; but in addition they have developed at least one principle of construction peculiar to an Act purporting to change an existing statute. Thus, as in the case of original Acts, the object in construing an amendatory Act is to determine the legislative intent. To do so, the court will read the amendment as a whole. Words of common use will be construed in their natural, plain and ordinar y meaning. If possible, effect must be given to every word. The amendment will be given a reasonable construction: a literal construction which would lead to absurd consequences will be avoided. When the intent of the legislature is not clear from its language, the court will consider surrounding circumstances.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Crawford summarises the position thus:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“Of course amendments or amendatory statutes are subject to the rules and principles of construction applicable to original enactments. For instance, the only legitimate recourse to construction is to ascertain the legislative intention. In ascertaining this intent the court may not only examine  the body of the statute, but its caption.  Statutes in pari materia  may also be resorted  to for assistance. Executive as well as judicial construction may likewise be of assistance.  And  the  evil sought to be remedied  by the amendment  may be considered as some indication of the legislative intent.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Cooley in his Constitutional Limitations at page 771 stated, a retroactive is one which reaches back and gives to a prior transaction some different legal effect from that which it had under the law when it took place. Lord Hatherby in Pardo V. Bingham, (1870) LR 4 Ch. App.735(740) observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘Baron Parke did not consider it an invariable rule that a statute could not be retrospective unless so expressed in the very terms of the section which had to be  construed,  and  said  that  the  question  in  each  case  was  whether  the legislature had sufficiently expressed that intention. In fact, we must look to the general scope and purview  of the statute, and the remedy sought to be applied, and consider what was the further state of the law, and what it was that the legislature contemplated’.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Wright,J. in Re Athlumney, (1898) 2 QB 547, 553 pointed out the use of past tense i.e. ‘shall have been’ which might suggest an inference as to retrospectivity in former states, in common in modern drafting in cases where retrospectivity is clearly not contemplated.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> The substance of the opinions of the authors is that no statute shall be construed so as to have a retrospective  operation  unless  its language  is such as plainly to require such a construction  and the same  rule involves another  and subordinate  rule to the effect that a statute is not to be construed  so as to have a greater retrospective effect than its language renders necessary. An enactment is presumed to be prospective unless the express provision in the enactment. The question of retrospective operation can never arise if the words of the statute make it clear that it should have prospective operation. Whenever the language of the legislature admits of two constructions, and if construed in one way results in too obvious an injustice, the court acts the view that such a result would never have been intended unless the intention has been manifested in the express words. Whenever the intention is clear that the Act shall have retrospective operation, it must unquestionably  be so construed  even if the consequences may appear unjust and hard. A retroactive statute contemplates the past and gives to a previous transaction by some different legal effect from that which it had under the law when it occurred or transpired.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Taking the above principles, it is pertinent at this juncture to explore the previous provisions on the subject matter for addressing the issue involves in this appeal. Diluvion and alluvion were common feature in this country because of the geographical location and the abundance of rivers flowing from Himalayas and its tributaries.  There was no law for the protection of the land which were washed away by the tides of the river or the sea. The right on the land to reformation <em>in situ </em>was for the first time given statutory recognition in Alluvion and Diluvion  Regulation,  1825  (Bengal  Reg.  of 1825)  for the whole  of Bengal  covering Bangladesh. Clause 4 of the Regulation stated as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"when land may be gained by gradual accession, whether from the recess of a river or of the sea, it shall be considered an increment to the tenure of the person to whose land or estate it is thus annexed, whether such land or estate be held immediately from Government by a Zaminder or other superior land-holder, or as a subordinate tenure, by any description of under-tenant whatsoever:<br/><br/>Provided that the increment of land thus obtained shall not entitle to which the land may be annexed   to a right of property or permanent interest therein beyond that possessed by him in the estate or tenure to which the land may be annexed, and shall not  in  any  case  be  understood  to  exempt  the  holder  of  it  from  the  payment  to Government of any assessment for the public revenue to which it may be liable under the provisions of Regulation II, 1819 or of any other Regulation in force."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>16.</strong> Nor, if annexed to a subordinate tenure held a superior landholder, shall the under- tenant, whether a khudkas raiyat, holding a mourusi istimari tenure at a fixed rate of rent per bigha, or any other description of under-tenant liable by his engagements, or by established usage, to an increase of rent for the land annexed to his tenure by alluvion, be considered exempt from the payment of any increase of rent to which he may be justly liable.’<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> So, under this provision there was accrual of the right of a riparian landlord or raiyat (now tenant or malik) to the land gained by the recess of river or of sea, and there need no recognition of such right by the Government or the Revenue Officer subject, however, that he would not be exempted  from the payment of rent and that such person could not claim a better right in the land added than what he had in the land to which the added land had been annexed. The underlying principle behind the promulgation of this provision has been lucidly explained by Lord Justice James in Felix Lopez V. Muddon Mohan Thakoor, 13 Moors I.A. 467, as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘Their Lordships, however, desire it to be understood that they do not hold that the property absorbed by a Sea or a River is, under all circumstances and after any lapse of time to  be recovered  by the owner.  It  may well be  that  it may have  been  so completely abandoned as to merge again like  any other derelict land, into the public domain, as part of the Sea or River of the state, and so liable to the written law as to accretion and annexation............ .......</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong> There is, however, another principle in the English Law, derived from the Civil Law, which is thus - that there is an acquisition of land from the Sea or River, by gradual, slow and imperceptible  means, there, from the supposed  necessity of the case, and the difficulty of having to determine, year by year, to whom an inch or a feet or a yard belongs, the accretion by alluvion is held to belong to the owner of the adjoining land.’<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> The philosophy behind it, as appears from a plain reading of the provisions provided in Regulation 4 is that if the accreted land are not sizeable area, nobody else than the riparian owner to whose land the additional land had been annexed, could use the land. It was in the context of the behaviour of the rivers of this region, the legislature considered it necessary to give right of the accreted land to the riparian owners. The Rent Act, 1859, recognised the above  principle  that  a  landlord  or  raiyat  was  liable  to  enhancement  of  rent  in  case  of increment of the area of the land of his tenancy by alluvion. So also, the landlord or the raiyat was entitled to abatement of rent in case of diluvion of the area of the land of his tenancy.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> The Bengal Tenancy Act, 1885, repealed the Rent Act keeping similar provisions as to abatement and enhancement of rent in section 52 of the Act. No specific provision was made in it relating to the right of accreted land or right to the reformation <em>in situ </em>in those Acts. They were guided and regulated by the Regulation of 1825. There was a change in the Bengal Tenancy Act by way of amendment in 1929 by inserting section 86A by the Bengal Act IV of 1928. It provided that the tenant’s right in the diluviated land could be deemed to have been surrendered and extinguished, if the tenant obtained any order of abatement of rent in respect  of such diluvion.  Sub-section  (2) of section 86A provided,  however,  that such extinction of right would not affect the accrual of his right of accretion in respect of the said land if it was available to him under any other law. This provision was substituted by new section 86A in 1938  enlarging  the  tenant’s  right  in certain  respects.  This  new  provision provided automatic abatement of rent in the case of loss of land by diluvion ensuring the subsistence of the right of the tenant in the land lost by diluvion for a period of twenty years.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> Then  there was  drastic  change  in the tenancy  laws  by the  State  Acquisition  and Tenancy Act, 1950, (Act of 1950), which is more or less a confiscatory piece of law. The object of this piece of legislation is liquidation of rent receiving interests subsisting between the State and the tillers of the soil. However, there was no substantial change with regard to the diluviation and alluviation of land. The provisions relating to the abatement of rent due to diluvion and the subsistence of tenant’s title in respect of such land had been kept similar to those in section 86A of the Bengal Tenancy Act, in section 86. It would be appropriate to reproduce the original provision as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“86(1) Abatement  of rent on account of diluvion and re-entry into lands which re-appear-If the lands of a holding or a portion of such lands are lost by diluvion, the rent of  the  holding  shall,  on  application  made  be  abated  by such  amount  as  may be considered by the Revenue Officer to be fair and equitable in accordance with the rules made in this behalf by the Provincial Government.<br/><br/>(2) Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  any  other  law  the  right,  title  and interest of the tenant or his successors-in-interest shall subsist in such lands or portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion, not exceeding twenty years, whether partly before and partly after or wholly after the commencement of this Part; and the tenant or his successors-in-interest shall have the right to immediate re-possession on the re-appearance of such lands or portion thereof within twenty years of their loss b y diluvion, and be liable to pay (arrears of rent  without interest or damage in respect of the  lands  which  has re-appeared  for  the  period  which  it was  lost  or  for 4  years whichever is less)."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>22.</strong> Provided that, when the lands or portion thereof which have so reappeared added to the total area of lands already in the possession of such tenant or his successors-in-interest exceed  the area of lands which the tenant  was allowed  to retain in his possession  under section 20, or the limit laid down in section 90, whichever  be greater,  such tenant or his successors-in- interest shall not have the right to repossession of such excess area of lands; and such excess area shall vest in and be at the disposal of the Provincial Government.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> Provided further that allotment of lands, of which such tenant or his successors-in- interest are entitled to re-possession under the above proviso, shall be made according to the choice of such tenant or his successors-in-interest.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> Provided further that the provision of this sub-section shall not apply to cases of re- appearance of lands caused or accelerated by any artificial or mechanical process as a result of development works undertaken by Government or by the East Pakistan Water and Power Development authority or by the East Pakistan Agricultural Development Corporation”.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> Part V of the Act contains section 86 which came into force in Dhaka on 1st August, 1963 and Faridpur on 5th August, 1963. Till such dates, in view of section 80 of the Act of 1950, the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act regulated the field of diluvion and alluvion of land in those districts. The deviation from the provisions of the Bengal Tenancy Act under the aforesaid provision is that there cannot be automatic abatement of rent in the case of loss of land  by diluvion  and there would be proportionate  abatement  of rent which might  be considered by the Revenue Officer on the application of the tenant. The subsistence of right on the re-appeared  land of the tenant of such diluviated  land shall continue within twenty years of loss or has re-appeared for the period which it was lost or for four years whichever is less subject to the condition regarding  the total area of land that could be retained  under sections 20 or 90 of the Act. If the total area of land in possession of the tenant exceeds the ceiling, his right of re-possession of the re-appeared land would be extinguished and the said land shall vest in the Government.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> There  was  further  change  in  the  provisions  by  way  of  substitution  of  the  said provision. The rights enjoyed by the riparian land owners on the accreted land was abrogated by the State Acquisition and Tenancy (Fourth Amendment) Order, 1972 (President’s Order No. 135 of 1972) effective from 4th November, 1972, which substituted section 86 of the Act as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“(1) If the lands of a holding or a portion of such lands are lost by diluvion, the rent of the holding shall be abated by such amount as may be considered  by the Revenue Officer to be fair and equitable in accordance with the rules made in this behalf by the Government.<br/>   (2) Notwithstanding anything contained  in any other law for the time being in force, the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successors-in-interest  shall be extinguished  in  such  lands  or  portion  thereof,  whether  the  loss  of  such  lands  or portion by diluvion took or takes place before or after the commencement of the State Acquisition and Tenancy (Fourth Amendment) Order, 1972.<br/>   (3) All lands, so lost by diluvion under sub-section (2), which re-appeared before the date of commencement of the said Order, but in respect of which the right of the tenant, whose land was so lost, or his successors-in-interest, to re-possession was not finally recognised or declared by a competent authority or Court under any law for the time being in force and also all lands, so lost by diluvion under the said sub-section, which may re-appear on or after the said date, shall vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances and shall be at its disposal.<br/>   (4)  Notwithstanding anything  contained   elsewhere in this Act, in making settlement of any land vested in Government under sub-section (3), preference shall be given to a person who has been affected by diluvion provided the total quantity of land, if any, already held by him and the other members of his family is less than twenty-five standard bighas:<br/>   Provided that the quantity of land so settled shall be such as, added to the quantit y of land, if any, already held by such person and the other members of his family, does not exceed twenty five standard bighas.<br/>   (5) All suits, applications, appeals or other proceedings in respect of any claim to the re-possession of any land lost by diluvion which has re-appeared or is alleged to have re-appeared pending before any Court or authority on the date of commencement of the said Order shall, not be further proceeded with and shall abate and no Court shall entertain any suit, application or other legal proceedings in respect of any such claim.”<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>27.</strong> Sub-section (4) was substituted for the former sub-section (4) with retrospective effect from 4th November, 1972 by Ordinance No.LXI of 1975. The previous provision was that while making settlement of any land vested in the Government, preference shall be given to a person who has been affected by diluvion but he will not get such preference  if the total quantity  of  land  already  held  by him  and  other  members  of  his  family  exceeds  twenty standard bighas. Under the  substituted  provision  a  condition  was  attached   in  giving preference to settlement to the effect that the re-appearance of the land must take place within twenty  years  from  the  date of loss.  When the Regulation of 1825 was promulgated, the legislature explained in detail in the preamble which weighed in making the said provision. Whereas, the legislature was totally silent in substituting section 86 by P.O.135 of 1972.<br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong> Sub-section (1) of the substituted provision relates to abatement of rent in respect of the land lost by diluvion which does not bring about any change from the earlier one. It is similar to the one as was amended by the East Pakistan Ordinance No.XXI of 1969, which dispensed with the filing of an application by the tenant to the Revenue Officer for abatement of rent as was required under the Bengal Tenancy Act. On a plain reading of the provisions substituted by P.O. 135 of 1972, there is no doubt about its operation, that is, it is prospective and  referred  to  the  land  which  were  diluviated  or  still  subject  to  diluvion.  It  was  said ‘diluvion took or takes place before or after ......’. Sub-section (2) purported to extinguish the title of the tenant/malik which had been lost by diluvion whether before or after the commencement of P.O.135 of 1972. So this provision is prospective in view of the language used  to  the effect  that if the loss  has taken place  ‘after  the commencement  of the State Acquisition and Tenancy (Fourth Amendment) Order, 1972’.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong> However, sub-section (3) which purported  to confer title upon the Government  in respect of the land which were lost by diluvion under sub-section (2) but re-appeared before the date of commencement of the said Order seemed to be otherwise. The land which were lost by diluvion but had re-appeared before the commencement of the said Order and also the land  so  lost by diluvion  which may re-appear  on or after  the said  date shall  vest  in the Government if the re-possession is not recognized by the Government or declared by a court. As regards in latter part is concerned, there is no difficulty to infer it in prospective operation because of the use of the expression ‘which may re-appear on or after the said date .......’<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong> This  provision  has been  substituted  again  by the  State  Acquisition  and  Tenanc y (Amendment)Act,  1994 (Act XV of 1994) which in fact revived the provision which was substituted by Article 2 of the President’s Order No.135 of 1972 with certain modifications as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“86. Abatement of rent on account of diluvion and determination of right in land re-appeared on account of alluvion –(1) If the lands of a holding or a portion of such lands are lost by diluvion, the rent or the land development tax of holding shall, on application or intimation made by the tenant in the prescribed form to the Revenue Officer, be abated by such amount as may be considered by the Revenue Officer to be fair and equitable in accordance with the rules made in this behalf b y the  Government  and  the  act  of  such  loss  by  diluvion  shall  be  recorded  in accordance with such rules, which shall be treated as proof of title to the lands when the same re-appear in situ. <br/>(2) Notwithstanding anything contained  in any other law for the time being in force, the right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist in the lands of a holding or portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion if such lands re-appear in situ within thirty years of their loss.<br/>(3) Notwithstanding the right, title and interest under sub-section (2), the right to immediate  possession  of the  lands  re-appeared  shall  first  be  exercised  by the Collector, either on his own motion or on an intimation made in writing by the tenant or his successor-in-interest whose land was so lost or by any other person.<br/>(4) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Act, the Collector or the Revenue officer shall, on taking possession of such lands give public notice of the fact of his taking possession in accordance with the rules made in this behalf by the Government and cause a survey to be made to the lands so re-appeared and prepare maps thereof.<br/>(5) ......................<br/>(6) ......................<br/>(6) ......................<br/>(7).......................”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>31.</strong> As observed above, the original provisions contained in section 86 of the Act, 1950 was similar to that contained in section 86A of the Bengal Tenancy Act. This new substituted provision enlarged the rights of the tenant in certain respects. This provision provided  for abatement of rent or tax on the diluviated land on the intimation by the tenant by such amount to be fair in accordance  with the Rules, that is, the Tenancy Rules, 1954. Under the said Rules, if the entire land of a holding is diluviated, the entire amount of rent payable for such holding shall be abated. When a part of a holding is diluviated, the amount by which the rent of the holding shall be abated shall bear the same proportion to the rent of the entire holding of the areas  of the  land  diluviated  bears to the  area of the land  comprised  in the entire holding. Though these Rules were promulgated in 1954, sub-section (1) clearly provides that these Rules will be applicable  since no new Rules have been framed thereafter. The only difference between these two provisions is that under the substituted provisions contained in 86A of the Bengal Tenancy Act in 1938, there was automatic abatement of rent in case of loss of land by diluvion but under the present provision, the abatement of rent or taxes on the diluviated land will take place on the intimation of the tenant proportionate to the land lost and if there is re-appearance within thirty years of loss, the order of the Revenue Officer on such intimation shall be treated as proof of title to the land.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong> So, this provision ensured the subsistence of the title to the land lost by diluvion on the re-appearance of the land within a period of thirty years notwithstanding the abatement of rent  or  tax.  The other  difference  between  these  two provisions  is that  under  the present provision  the  right  of  possession  after  re-appearance  shall  be  exercised  initially  by  the Collector who shall make a survey of the land so re-appeared and after completion of survey, he shall allot the land to the tenant whose land were lost provided that the quantity of land in his possession together with the land alluviated shall not exceed sixty standard bighas and the excess land shall vest in the Government.<br/> <br/><strong>33.</strong> Reading sub–section (2) of section 86, one may come to the conclusion that these provisions are also prospective in operation, inasmuch as, it has been provided that ‘the right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist in the lands of a holding.....’ The subsistence of title of the tenant if the diluviated  land ‘re-appear in situ within thirty years of loss’ that is to say, if the re-appearance  takes place in future. If we compare the two provisions of sub-section (2), the earlier one substituted by P.O.135 of 1972 and the present one substituted by Act XV of 1994, we may come to a correct conclusion. Under the old provision the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor shall be extinguished  if the diluvion took or takes place ‘before or after the commencement  of the State Acquisition and Tenancy (Fourth Amendment) Order, 1972’, i.e. till the date of substitution of section 86 by Act XV of 1994.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong> Apparently the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor shall subsist in the land from the date of substitution of section 86 if the land diluviated re-appear within thirt y years from that date. The legislature is totally silent as regards the operation of the substituted Provision by Act XV of 1994, whether this provision will have prospective or retrospective effect but we find no ambiguity in the  language  used in it. It is said ‘the right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest  shall subsist.....’ The legislature has used the word ‘shall’ that is, the right of the tenant shall subsist in respect of diluviated land if such land re-appear  within thirty years of loss, that is to say, if the re-appearance  of the diluviated land takes place in future. Under the previous provision limited retrospective operation  was  given  to  the  loss  of  land  by  diluvion  which  ‘took’  place  before  the commencement of the substituted provision but under the present provision, such language was deliberately omitted.<br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong> The High Court Division reproduced section 86 substituted by P.O.135 of 1972 and then the next substituted provision by Act XV of 1994 while considering the commencement and operation of the law and formulated the point to the effect that “whether the petitioner’s right on his lands diluvated 1991 and 1992 subsists under the State Acquisition and Tenancy Amendment Act, 1994” and then it considered sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 86 which were substituted by P.O.135 of 1972 and held that ‘although by clause (sic) 2 of the article (sic)   the right, title and interest of the tenant extinguished  on diluvion the right, title and interest will vest in the Government in respect of such diluviated lands on its re-appearance’ and then after consideration of sub-section (2) of the substituted provision by Act XV of 1994 held that ‘the right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist in the lands of a holding or portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion if such lands re-appear <em>in situ </em>within thirty or their loss.’ And then concluded its opinion by observing  that ‘the land which were in diluvion prior to 13th July,  1994, the right of the original tenant or his successors in these lands would continue if the land re-appeared in situ within 30 years. The Government can only claim such of those lands in diluvion which had re-appeared prior to 13th July, 1994 under the President’s Order No.135 of 1972 but cannot claim such right in respect of land which is still in diluvion’.  In respect of the impugned order, it was observed, in respect of the land ‘re-appeared (alluviated) prior to 13th July, 1994 will vest in the Government  and that Act XV of 1994 was not applicable  to such lands’. These findings are inconsistent with the operating part of the judgment. It is very difficult to follow the correct opinion expressed by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong> This conclusion of the High Court Division is not only not sound but also contrary to the spirit of the law. When on a plain reading of the provision it is found that the tenant’s right, title and interest shall subsist on the diluviated land if such land re-appear within thirty years of their loss, there is no scope for the courts to infer otherwise. They cannot enlarge and/or give a wider meaning of the words when they are clear and unambiguous.  It is the fundamental rule of law that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation unless  such constitution  appears  very clearly  in the  terms of Act or arises  by necessar y implication. The use of the words ‘shall’ or ‘hereafter’ is taken to indicate an intent that the statute is to be construed  as prospective only. It can be stated generally that an Act prima facie deals with future and not with past events.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong> There are three provisions  in succession  over  the same  subject matter.  Under  the original provision, the right of the tenant in the diluviated land or a portion thereof subsisted during the period of loss by diluvion not exceeding twenty years whether before and partly after or wholly after the commencement of Part-V and the tenant or his successor-in-interest was entitled to immediate re-possession on the re-appearance of such land or portion thereof within twenty years of loss by diluvion irrespective of the question whether any abatement of rent had taken place in respect of the land or not.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong> Under the substituted provision by P.O. 135 of 1972, the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor-in-interest  would extinguish with the diluvion of the land or portion thereof,  whether  the  loss  of  such  land  by diluvion  took/takes  place  before  or  after  the commencement  of  the  Order  i.e.  before  or  after  4th November,  1972.  Then  the  present substituted provisions which came into force on 13th July, 1994, in which, the right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor-in-interest  on the diluviated  land or portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion shall subsist if such land re-appear within thirty years of loss. The right of the tenant or his successor-in-interest  to re-possession on the re-appeared land had altogether been taken away by P.O. 135 of 1972 and the interest of the tenant in respect  of  such  diluviated  land  was  extinguished.  It  was  only  if  his  re-possession  was recognized by the Government or declared by the authority or the Court, he could claim right on such land. If there is reformation <em>in situ </em>before the commencement of P.O.135 of 1972, the right  of  the  tenant  or  his  successor-in-interest  in  respect  of  such  land  which  were  not recognized  by the competent  authority or  court,  the  land  so  lost by diluvion  even  if re- appeared after the promulgation of the said Order would vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong> Again by way of addition of sub-section (4) by Ordinance LXI of 1975, there was departure from the original provision contained in sub-section (2), and a privilege has been given to the tenant that he or his successor be given the preference in respect of settlement of the land so lost subject to the land holding limitation. Sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 86 substituted by P.O.135 of 1972 would have limited retrospective operation from the date of coming into force of Part V of the Act in the particular district in which the land situate. Admittedly, the diluvion of the land in question in the present case took place between 1991 and 1992. The present substituted section 86(2) provides that the right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest  shall subsist in the land of a holding or a portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion if such land re-appear ‘within thirty years of their loss’. This provision ensures the subsistence of the right, title and interest of the original tenant in the land lost by diluvion if the land so lost re-appear within thirty years of loss notwithstanding the abatement of rent of such lands.<br/> <br/><strong>40</strong>. In Syed Nizamuddin Mohsin V. Bangladesh, 41 DLR(AD) 141, the plaintiff instituted a suit in 1970 seeking declaration of title in respect of 12.40 acres of land on the averments that the said land gradually diluviated by the river in 1338 B.S. corresponding to 1931 and the land reformed <em>in situ </em>in 1352 B.S. The said land again sub-merged in 1362-63 B.S., which re- appeared  in 1374 (1964) and thereafter,  it was recorded  in the name  of the Government. Though  the  trial  court  decreed  the  suit  but  on  appeal  by Government  the  decision  was reversed.  On  a  second  appeal,  the  High  Court  Division  affirmed  the  appellate  court’s judgment on the reasonings that whatever title the plaintiff had which were extinguished by reason of sub-sections  (2) and (3) of section 86 substituted  by P.O. 135 of 1972.  In the context of the matter, this Division on construction of sections (2) and (3) of section 86 of the Act substituted by P.O.135 of 1972 observed:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“It is clear that clauses (2) and (3) as above get immediately attracted because the diluvion took place before the commencement of P.O.135 of 1972 and the lands  also  reappeared  before  the  commencement  of  the  said  order.  Under clause (2) the right, title and interest of the tenant get extinguished as soon as his  land  is  diluviated.  Clause  (3)  provides  that  all  such  lands  which  re- appeared before the commencement of P.O.135 of 1972 shall vest absolutely in the  government  free  from  all encumbrances  and  shall  be  at its disposal except those in respect of which the right of the tenant to re-possession was finally recognized  or declared by a competent authority or Court, obviously after re-appearance.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>41.</strong> Almost similar question came up for consideration before this Division in Mannan V. Kulada Ranjan, 31 DLR(AD) 195. While considering the right, title, interest of the tenant to the diluviated  land  after  substitution  of section  86  of the  Act  by P.O.135  of 1972  D.C. Bhattacharya, J. observed that ‘the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 86 of the Act cannot be given any retrospective effect beyond the date of coming into force of Part V of  the  Act  in  the  area  in  which  the  diluviated  lands  were  situated’.  However,  on  the construction of section 87 which was substituted by P.O. 137 of 1972, it was observed in paragraph  38 that section  87  could  have  no  effect  before  the provisions  of Part  V were brought into operation by the Government by issuing appropriate notifications under section 79 of the Act. Section 87 relates to the heading ‘Right in land gained by accession  from recess of river or sea’. Suffice it to mention here that both the provisions of sections 86 and 87 are cognate in nature.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong> It was observed that the intention of the law maker as to the extent of retrospectivit y of section 87, from the use of the words “whether before or after 28.6.72” instead of using the more specific provision “whenever so gained” in sub-section (2), it may also very well be argued  that  had  it  been  the  intention  of  the  law  maker  to  give  the  widest  possible retrospective effect to the provision of sub-section (1), it could have been very well expressed in sub-section (1) itself, instead of enacting sub-section (2), by inserting the words “nor shall be  deemed  to  have  been  considered”  in sub-section  (1)  after  the  words  “it shall  not  be considered” and the words “and shall be deemed to have vested” after the words “shall vest” and by adding at the end of the said sub-section, the words of the latter part of sub-section (2) of section 87, which showed that section 87 could have no effect before the provisions of Part V were brought into operation. His Lordship concluded his opinion in the following manner:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">‘The  past  rights  which  have  already  accrued  have  not  been  sought  to  be affected by President’s Order No.137 of 1972 retrospectively, but such rights were purported to be affected only prospectively.  That is to say, the right of accretion which the riparian owner had acquired in respect of the lands added to his holding before 28.6.72 ceased to be operative and to remain in force only since 4.11.72, the date of the coming into force of the President’s Order No.137 of 1972. In that sense also it would, no doubt, be destructive of some vested rights, though in a prospective sense’.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>43.</strong> The new substituted sub-section (2) of section 86 clearly says that the right, title and interest of the tenant shall subsist during the period of loss by diluvion and the tenant or his successor can claim right to the said land if re-appear within a period of thirty years of loss. The meaning of this sub-section ensuring the right of the tenant or his successor is so clear that his right subsists if the diluvion and the alluvion takes place after coming into force of section 86 substituted by Act XV of 1994. There cannot be any explanation other than this. The Secretary of the Government gave the explanation of this substituted provision that if the land were diluviated prior to 13th July, 1994, the amended provision would not be applicable in respect of those land. It will be significant to note that in the introductory clause the words ‘Notwithstanding anything contained <u>in any other law </u> for the time being in force’ (emphasis supplied) have been used instead of using the words ‘in the Act’. There is no reference to the law contained in the Act, 1950. The intention of the legislature is thus clear to come to the conclusion that if the land diluviated before 13th July, 1994, the tenant cannot claim right, title or interest of the alluviated land even if the land re-appear within thirty years from 13th July, 1994. The tenant or his successor can claim title on the re-appeared land within thirty years of loss if the diluvion took place after 13th July, 1994.<br/> <br/><strong>44.</strong> The High Court Division has totally overlooked the views taken by this Division in Syed Nizamuddin Mohsin (Supra). Thus, the views taken by the High Court Division that the ‘right, title and interest of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest  shall subsist in the land of a holding or portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion if such lands re- appear in situ within thirty years of their loss’ and that the ‘Government can only claim such of those land in diluvion which had re-appeared prior to 13th July, 1994 under the President’s Order No.135 of 1972 but cannot claim such right in respect of land which is still in diluvion’ are not only contrary to the letter and spirit of the legislature, but also inconsistent with the views taken by this Division. The High Court Division was totally confused of the language used in sub-section (2) of section 86. The observations of the High Court Division that ‘theland which were in diluvion prior to 13th July, 1994, the right of the original tenant or his successors in these lands would continue if the lands re-appeared in situ within 30 years’ is based on misconstruction of sub-section (2) of section 86.<br/> <br/><strong>45.</strong> This provisions carry one meaning other than that the right of the tenant shall subsist if the diluvion takes place after 13th July, 1994 and not in case of the diluvion which is in process prior to the coming into force of the substituted provision of section 86 by the Act XV of 1994. The tenant or his successor-in-interest can claim right in the said diluviated land if the said land  re-appear  within thirty years of loss from the said  date. The High Court Division has unnecessarily endeavoured its effort on the question of vesting of the diluviated land in the Government instead of examining whether the tenant’s right in the diluviated land or if the process of diluvion took place prior to 13th July, 1994, the tenant’s right, title and interest shall exist or not.<br/> <br/><strong>46.</strong> In view of the use of the words, ‘the right,  title and interest  of the tenant  or his successor-in-interest shall subsist’ during the period of loss if the land re-appear <em>in situ </em>within thirty years of loss is so clear and unambiguous that the legislature intended this provision to have prospective operation. The use of the word ‘shall’ is taken to indicate that the statute is to be construed  as prospective  only. The words ‘within thirty years of loss’ means  if the diluvion takes place after 13th July, 1994, the tenant or his successor’s right to re-possession shall subsist if the diluviated land re-appear within thirty years of loss and not otherwise. The amendment is prospective in operation and the High Court Division is not correct in giving retrospective operation of the substituted provision of sub-section (2) of section 86 of the Act of 1950.<br/> <br/><strong>47.</strong> We sum up as under:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">Land of a holding or a portion thereof is lost by diluvion prior to 4th November, 1972, the rent of the holding shall on application by the tenant would abate by such  amount  as  would  be  considered  by the  Revenue  Officer  to  be  fair  and equitable.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The right, title and interest of the tenant shall be extinguished  if such land were lost by diluvion or the process of diluvion takes place before or after the date of coming into force of section 86 substituted by P.O.135 of 1972.</li><li style="text-align:justify">If the diluvited land or a portion thereof re-appeared after the commencement of P.O.135 of 1972 but in respect of which the right of the original tenant or his successor-in-interest whose land was so lost, to re-possession was not recognized or declared by the competent authority or the court, all land so lost, which may reappear on or after 4th November, 1972, shall vest absolutely in the Government.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In making settlement of the said land, notwithstanding anything provided in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above, the preference shall be given to the tenant or his successor-in-interest whose interest was lost by diluvion subject to the condition that such land or a portion thereof re-appeared within twenty years of such loss subject to the condition that the total area of land possessed by the tenant or his family does not exceed the ceiling prescribed by sections 20 or 90 of the Act of 1950.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The rights which had already accrued to the tenant or his successor-in-interest on the day of coming into force of section 86 by P.O.135 of 1972 had not been affected but such rights were affected only prospectively.</li><li style="text-align:justify">If the land or a portion thereof is diluviated after 13th July, 1994, the rent or the land development tax of the holding of the tenant or his successor-in-interest be abated on his application, such amount as may be considered by the Revenue Officer and the act of such loss by diluvion shall be recorded by such Revenue Officer.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The right, title and interest of the tenant or his successor-in-interest shall subsist of a holding or a portion thereof during the period of loss by diluvion from 15th July, 1994, if such land re-appear <em>in situ </em>within thirty years of loss.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Collector, either on his own motion or on the basis of application of the tenant or his successor-in-interest shall exercise the right of immediate possession of the land so re-appeared and shall give public notice of the said fact, prepare a map, make survey of the land and after forty five days of completion of survey, allot the land to the tenant or his successor-in-interest such quantity of land which together with the land already held by him shall not exceed sixty standard bighas.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Section 86 substituted by the State Acquisition and Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1994 (Act XV of 1994) shall have prospective operation. </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">The appeal is, therefore, allowed without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Further contending that summons of Title Suit no.118 of 1963 were duly served upon all the defendants, some of them contested the suit by filing written statement and some others prayed saham; On the expiry of defendant no.93 Fazlur Rahman, suit was abated but abatement order was cancelled in Miscellaneous Case No.10 of 1974; Summons of said miscellaneous case also served upon all the opposite parties; Predecessor of defendant nos. 16-21 alongwith five other defendants filed Title Suit No.16 of 1978 against exparte decree; Father of plaintiff nos. 4 and 5 i.e Abdul Hafiz, who was impleaded as defendant no.54 in the Title Suit, alongwith other two filed Miscellaneous Case No.11 of 1978 which was allowed and the exparte decree was set aside; Thereafter, preliminary decree passed on 05.06.1979 in presence of contesting defendants and subsequently final decree drawn up in accordance with law; Plaintiffs  of the present suit and their predecessors has/had prior knowledge about preliminary decree and final decree passed in the Title Suit; Present suit filed only to harass the defendants; Suit is liable to be dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Defendant Nos. 16-21 contested the suit by filing written statement supporting case of the plaintiffs.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> After hearing the parties and assessing evidence on record learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Dhaka, decreed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Being aggrieved, defendants as appellants filed Title Appeal No.451 of 2006 in the Court of learned District Judge, Dhaka. On transfer, said appeal was heard and disposed of by the learned Additional District Judge, 8<sup>th</sup> Court, Dhaka, who after hearing the parties and reassessing evidence on record disallowed the appeal and thus affirmed findings of the trial court.  <br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Having aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment and decree, defendant nos.1,3-7,-appellants as petitioners preferred this revisional application under Section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the present rule with an order of status-quo.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Mr. Abdul Quiyum, learned advocate for the petitioners submits that admittedly plaintiff of original suit No. 118 of 1963 Adam Ali was owner of <sup>rd</sup> share of the suit land by inheritance and the suit was decreed allowing saham to the plaintiff accordingly as such, appellate court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in not holding that plaintiffs are not aggrieved by the impugned judgment and decree. He also submits that appellate court below committed an illegality in not holding that if the summons were not served upon some of the defendants that was mere irregularity which cannot be ground for setting aside a decree under Section 99 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He next submits that the court below committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice in not considering that original suit was filed in the year 1963 before promulgation of S. A. and R. S. record as such, mentioning number of unborn S. A. and R. S. khatian relating to suit plots were not possible. He also submits that plaintiff nos. 2,3, 7-18 are not parties in the original suit and as such allegation of non service of summons against them is not tenable in the eye of law. He submits that plaintiff nos. 1,4-6 were impleaded as defendants in the original suit as such, burden of proof lies upon them to prove that summons were not served. He lastly submits that appellate court below committed an illegality in not holding that the suit is barred by limitation inasmuch as final decree was drawn up on 28.04.1980 and the present suit filed long after 10 years on 08.04.1990 which is barred under Article 91 and 120 of the Limitation Act as such, impugned judgment and decree is liable to be set aside. In support of his submissions, learned advocate referred to the case of Ratan Chandra Dey and others-Vs- Jinnator Nahar and others, reported in 13 MLR (AD)168, the case of Bhashani Mondal being dead his heirs; Nanda Rani Mondal and another-Vs- Md. Abdus Sukur and others, reported in 18 BLT(AD)497, the case of  Girish Chandra Jana-Vs- Kala Chand Maity, reported in AIR 1957 (Calcatta) 242 and the case of Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Forest, Secretariat Building, Dhaka and others-Vs-Md. Osimuddin, reported in 11 MLR (AD)132.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> On the other hand Mr. Md. Mainul Islam, learned advocate for the opposite parties submits that it is evident from record of the Title Suit that when preliminary decree was passed then the suit was not ready for hearing inasmuch as court below fixed 16.06.1979 for submitting written statement but PW.1 Md. Habibullah examined on 01.06.1979 and preliminary decree passed on 05.06.1979 as such, there is nothing to interfere with the impugned judgment and decree. He also submits that record of the Title Suit shows that PW.1 Md. Habib Ullah did not file any document in support of his deposition. He again submits that both the courts below upon assessing and reassessing evidence on record arrived at a concurrent finding that summon of the original suit was not served upon plaintiff no.1 of the present suit Kalu Khan who was impleaded as defendant no.14 in the original suit inasmuch as Mujibul Huq who allegedly received summon on behalf of Kalu Khan had no manner of relation with said Kalu Khan and defendants of the present suit failed to prove that Mujibul Huq was an agent of Kalu Khan. He next submits that plaintiffs having impeached the decree passed in earlier suit on ground of collusion and fraud on the assertion that they are owners in possession of the suit land, they are not required to seek any further relief to their main relief of declaration. He submits that once an amendmend is allowed, said amendment relates back to the date of institution of the suit. He lastly submits that there is no question of limitation when it is proved that summons were fraudulently suppressed and limitation will run from the date when the fraud was detected. In support of his contention, learned advocate referred to the case of Abdus Sukur (Md) and others-Vs- Bhasani Mandal and another, reported in 53 DLR 452, the case of Doon Valley Rice Limited-Vs-MV Yue Yang and others, reported in 48 DLR 531 and the case of Abul Khair Mia-Vs- Abdul Latif Sarder, reported in 32 DLR(AD)167.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Mr. A. K. M. Rezaul Karim, learned advocate for the opposite party No.22 by adopting submissions of Mr. Md. Mainul Islam add that plaintiffs of Title Suit no.118 of 1963 obtained the decree by suppressing summons and this finding of fact has been arrived at both by the trial court and appellate court below which is not revisable in this jurisdiction. He again submits that the finding of fact arrived at by the appellate court below which is the last court of fact that summons were fraudulently suppressed. He also relied upon the case reported in 32 DLR(AD)167.  <br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Heard the learned advocates. Perused revisional application, judgment of the courts below alongwith lower courts record of the present suit and Title Suit No.118 of 1963 and decisions cited by the learned Advocates.<br/> <br/>12. Main contention of the plaintiffs in the present suit are that preliminary decree and final decree obtained in Title Suit No.118 of 1963 by suppressing summons fraudulently and also that at the time of passing preliminary decree, original suit was not ready for hearing. Relevant orders from order sheet of Title Suit no.118 of 1963 are reproduced below:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>“<u>Order no.289 dated 31.5.79:</u> </strong><em>Pltff. and the defdt. nos. 89, 91, 24, 101, 104 and some added defdts. file hajiras.

Let the petitions be kept with the record.</em><br/><br/><strong><u>Order No. 294 dated 4.6.79:</u></strong>  <em>Defdt. no.105 files a petition with  court fees of taka 20/- and prays for separate saham. Let this petition be kept with the record.</em><br/><br/><strong><u>Order No. 295 dated  5.6.79:</u></strong> <em>Case is  proved. C.

Plaintiffs do get a saham of </em><em><sup>rd</sup></em><em> share in “C” schedule land. Parties may effect partition amicably within 60 days from today, failing which plaintiffs are entitled to get their saham separated by metes and bounds through court, by appointment of commissioner, who, if appointed and commissioned, is to respect possession and convenience and transfers of by respective parties so far as practicable.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong> From the above orders, it appears that vide order no.290 dated 01.06.1979 though trial court fixed 16.06.1979 for written statement but on the same date i.e. 01.06.79 examined PW.1 Habibullah vide order no.294. More interesting is that suit decreed on 05.06.1979 though 16.06.79 fixed for written statement. From the above quoted orders it is evident that when preliminary decree passed, suit was not ready for hearing. So, I cannot disagree with finding of the appellate court below that decree was not passed in accordance with law. On perusal of the order sheet, I find that some of the orders i.e. from order no.247-253 are missing from the record.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> On perusal of the record, it appears both the courts below arrived at a concurrent finding that summon was not served upon plaintiff no.1 Kalu Khan inasmuch as Mujibul Huq who allegedly received summon on behalf of Kalu Khan was not his agent and defendants failed to prove that he had any manner of relationship with Kalu Khan. From the plaint of present suit it also appears that owners of lands namely Anwaruddin Ahmed and Khandker Kamrul Huda who purchased the land on 18.03.1953 and sold the same to Badrunnessa Chowdhury vide kabala dated 20.12.1961 who on her turn sold the land to vendor of plaintiffs no. 2 and 3 were not made party in the original suit. It is also stated in the plaint that predecessor of plaintiff nos. 4 and 5 Abdul Hafiz Sarker purchased the land on 19.04.1961 but he was not made party in the original suit though one Howlader Abdul Hafez Sarker without mentioning father’s name impleaded in the original suit as defendant no.54. Order V of the Code of Civil Procedure deals with the issue and service of summons.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Finding of facts arrived at by the appellate court below as the last court of fact that summons were suppressed and decree obtained in the original suit fraudulently and collusively are not perverse and based on evidence on record. It is settled that once fraud is established, limitation will run from the date when it was detected.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> It is not clear from the order sheet of Title Suit no.118 of 1963 whether Md. Habibullah who deposed as PW. 1 submitted documents in support of his testimony. Learned Advocate for the petitioners submitted that the plaintiffs of the present suit are not aggrieved by the judgment and decree of the previous suit inasmuch as plaintiff of the original suit allowed saham in respect of <sup>rd</sup> share as claimed by him as C.S. recorded tenant but on perusal of the plaint of Title Suit it appears that contentions of the plaintiff in the suit could be reverted by the defendants by filing written statement and adducing evidence if summons were duly served upon them as such, submission of the learned advocate does not hold water in the present context.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> Under the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons stated above, I am of the view that preliminary decree passed in the Title suit when suit was not ready for hearing as such, preliminary decree and subsequent final decree were not passed in accordance with law and summons of the Title Suit No. 118 of 1963 were fraudulently suppressed as such, question of limitation does not arise. Furthermore, plaintiff of the Title suit obtained preliminary and final decree without impleading the persons who owned and possessed suit land before institution of Title suit.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> In the present suit, plaintiffs impeached preliminary decree and final decree passed in Title Suit No. 118 of 1963 on ground of collusion and fraud on the assertion that they are owners in possession of their portion in the suit land before institution of the Title Suit in the year 1963.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> Both the courts below found that the plaintiffs are in possession in their portion of the suit land and the predecessor of the defendants obtained the decree collusively and fraudulently. In such view of the matter, plaintiffs are not required to seek any other relief as ‘further relief’ to their main relief of declaration.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> Facts and circumstances of the cases cited by the learned Advocate for the petitioners are quite distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> Accordingly, the rule is discharged without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> Impugned judgment and decree dated 08.05.2008 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, 8th Court, Dhaka, in Title Appeal No.406 of 2006 is maintained.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> Order of status-quo granted at the time of issuance of the rule is hereby vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> Accordingly, Title Suit No.118 of 1963, renumbered as Title Suit No.69 of 1986, is restored. Court concern is directed to dispose of the suit as soon as possible preferably within 1(one) year from the date of receipt of this judgment.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> It is pertinent to mention here that disposal of the Title Suit should be confined within the present parties without allowing any further application for addition of party, otherwise it will be an unending process.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> Send down lower courts record alongwith a copy of this judgment to the court concern at once.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

It was mentioned in the appointment orders that after successful completion of probation period their cases would be considered for regular appointment. Being satisfied with the services of the petitioners on probation, respondent No.4 by office order dated 14.12.1986 appointed them as Radio Operators on regular basis with effect from 01.12.1986. The petitioners were promoted to the post of Assistant Accountants on 08.12.1996 and 07.12.1996. While serving BSS sincerely, honestly, efficiently and diligently to the satisfaction of all concerned, the petitioners were taken by surprise to receive a copy of the office order dated 28.07.2003 issued under the signature of the Managing Director and Chief Editor of BSS (respondent No.4) stating therein:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">""সংস্থার হিসাব বিভাগ কর্তৃক সম্পাদিত বেতন-ভাতার সীটে গুরূতর আর্থিক অভিযোগ পাওয়া গেছে। বাসস কর্মচারী চাকুরী বিধিমালা ১৯৯৫-এ ৭(সাত) অধ্যায়ের ৩৮-এর "চ' ও "ছ' অনুযায়ী অভিযুক্ত করার মত গুরূতর অপরাধ। এ প্রেক্ষিতে সংস্থার ভারপ্রাপ্ত প্রধান হিসাব রক্ষক জনাব ইউছুফ আলী মোল্লার নেতৃত্বে ১(এক) সদস্য বিশিষ্ট তদন্ত কমিটি গঠন করা হল। এই কমিটিকে আগামী ৪ আগষ্ট, ২০০৩ ইং তারিখের মধ্যে এ ব্যাপারে বিস্তারিত তদন্ত প্রতিবেদন (যদি অতীতেও এমন ঘটনা ঘটে থাকে তা সহ) নিম্ন স্বাক্ষরকারীর নিকট পেশ করতে বলা হল।'' </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Petitioner Nos.1 and 2 were placed under suspension by orders dated 03.08.2003 and 05.08.2003 respectively purportedly under the provisions of Regulation 44(1) of BSS Employees Service Regulations, 1995 pending an enquiry under Regulation 38(Cha) of the said Regulations. Respondent No.4 by memos dated 06.08.2003 served charge sheets cum show cause notices upon the petitioners alleging some financial irregularities therein. The petitioners made separate reply to the said notices on 14.08.2003 and 13.08.2003 denying the allegations brought against them. An enquiry committee was formed behind the back of the petitioners on 18.08.2003. But the said committee without following the procedure laid down in the BSS Employees Service Regulations, 1995 and without affording the petitioners ample opportunity of hearing arbitrarily prepared a report which was never brought to the notice of the petitioners. The petitioners were taken by surprise to receive the impugned orders of termination dated 09.09.2003 by post under Regulation 54(2) of the said Regulations, 1995.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with Memo No. <strong>২০১/অ আ/ব্যপ/ডি-৫৭৩১</strong> and Memo No. <strong>২০৩/অ আ/ব্যপ/ডি-৫৭৩২</strong> dated 09.09.2003 issued under the signature of the Managing Director and Chief Editor of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) (respondent No.4) terminating the services of the petitioners under Regulation 54(2) of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha Employees Service Regulations, 1995 and also questioning the vires of Regulation 54 of the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha Employees Service Regulations, 1995, the petitioners filed a writ petition before the High Court Division and obtained Rule Nisi in Writ Petition No. 3617 of 2005.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> The facts relevant for the purpose of disposal of Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2011, in a nutshell, are:<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> The petitioners were appointed in different posts in the Chittagong Port Authority, and subsequently were promoted to the higher posts upon satisfactory discharge of duties. The petitioners were terminated from service under Regulation 54(2) of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991. The petitioners were terminated from service in violation of Articles 26 and 31 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> The petitioners filed a writ petition before the High Court Division challenging the constitutionality of Regulation 55(2) of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 (Annexure-A)) and office order No.12-2003 dated 25.02.2003 issued by respondent No.3 terminating the petitioners from service (Annexure-P) pursuant to Regulation 55(2) of the said Regulations and obtained Rule Nisi in Writ Petition No. 2300 of 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> Writ-respondent No.4 of Writ Petition No. 3617 of 2005 and writ-respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 of Writ Petition No. 2300 of 2003 contested the Rules by filing separate affidavit-in-oppositions controverting the material statements made in the writ petitions.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> The learned Judges of the High Court Division upon hearing the parties by the impugned judgments and orders dated 27.08.2007 and 22.10.2008 respectively discharged the Rules.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgments and orders passed by the High Court Division, the petitioners of both the writ petitions as the leave petitioners have filed Civil Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos. 2291 of 2008 and 373 of 2009 before this Division and leave was granted in both the civil petitions on 09.07.2009 and 06.10.2010 resulting in Civil Appeal Nos. 506 of 2009 and 98 of 2011.    <br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellants in Civil Appeal No.506 of 2009,  submits that the provision of Regulation 54(2) of the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha Kormochary Regulation, 1995 is void being violative of fundamental right guaranteed by Article 27 of the Constitution and that it does not provide for any guideline for exercise of the power of termination and permits arbitrary and discriminatory treatment and as such, the impugned judgment should be set aside. In this appeal, he further submits that the case involves a question of great public importance, namely, whether in a case where the employer has passed an order of termination simpliciter without stigma and that order has been challenged in the Court on the ground of <em>mala fide</em> and arbitrariness, can the employer be allowed to a plea that in fact, the employees concerned were found guilty in a departmental proceeding but the authority as an act of grace without inflicting punishment of dismissal awarded order of termination simpliciter.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2011, submits that Regulation No.55(2) of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 having not provided any guideline for exercise of the power of termination of employees without assigning any reason is void being violative of fundamental right guaranteed by Article 27 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Mr. Mahbubey Alam, learned Attorney General, appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2 in Civil Appeal No. 506 of 2009, on the other hand, submits that the authority terminated the appellants in exercise of the power under Regulation 54(2) of the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha Kormochary Regulation, 1995 and that termination simpliciter without stigma does not call for interference. He further submits that the High Court Division came to a finding that the allegations brought against the appellants were proved and that the concerned authority without awarding punishment to the appellants terminated them from service and that the orders of termination were not illegal and as such, no interference is called for.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> Mrs. Sufia Khatun, learned Advocate-on-Record, appearing on behalf of the respondents in Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2011, on the other hand, supports the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> We have considered the submissions of the Senior Advocate for the appellants of both the appeals and the learned Attorney General for respondent Nos.1 and 2 of Civil Appeal Nos. 506 of 2009 and the learned Advocate-on-record of the respondents of Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2011, perused the impugned judgments and the materials on record.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> Before entering into the merit of both the appeals, it would be pertinent to go through the grounds, for which, leave was granted in both the appeals.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> The grounds of Civil Appeal No. 506 of 2009 are quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“The case involves a question great public importance namely, whether in a case where the employer has passed an order of termination simpliciter without stigma and that order has been challenged in the Court on the ground of <em>mala fide</em> and arbitrariness can the employer be allowed to take a plea that in fact, the employees concerned were found guilty in a departmental proceeding but the authority as an act of grace without inflicting punishment of dismissal awarded order of termination simpliciter. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The case involves a question of law of great public importance namely, when the employer authority has passed orders of termination simpliciter without stigma against the petitioners, can the High Court Division in its writ jurisdiction in the nature of certiorari find the petitioners guilty of misconduct placing itself into the role of a domestic more particularly where admittedly the proceeding initiated was not concluded by serving second show cause notice with proposed punishment upon the petitioners and by receiving reply thereof.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">In the instant case Regulation 54(2) of the BSS Employees Service Regulations has been resorted to in a manner and for the purpose not intended by the legislature and as such, the  mala fide and arbitrariness of the respondents are apparent on the face of the record.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The provision of Regulation 94(2) of the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha Kormochary Regulation, 1995 is void being violative of fundamental right guaranteed by Article 27 of the Constitution inasmuch as it does not provide any guideline for the exercise of the power of termination and permits arbitrary and discriminatory treatment.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>20.</strong> The ground of Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2011 is quoted below:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“I. Whether the provisions of Regulation 55(2)of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 having not provided any guideline for exercise of the power of termination of employees without assigning any reason is void being violative of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 27 of the Constitution.” </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>21.</strong> The common questions of law to be decided in both the appeals are almost identical.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> In both the appeals, it is to be decided whether the Regulation empowering the authority to terminate an employee form service can be exercised without any guideline.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> For proper appreciation, it is pertinent to quote Regulation 54(2) of the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangtha Karmachari Regulation,1995 which is as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৫৪(২) এই প্রবিধানমালায় ভিন্নরুপ যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, কর্তৃপক্ষ কোন কারণ প্রদর্শন ব্যতিরেকে ৩ (তিন) মাসের আগাম নোটিশ দিয়া অথবা তৎপরিবর্তে ৩ (তিন) মাসের মূল বেতনের সমপরিমান অর্থ পরিশোধ করিয়া যে কোন কর্মচারীর চাকুরীর অবসান ঘটাইতে পারিবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>24.</strong> It is also necessary to quote Regulation 55(2) of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations,1991:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“৫৫(২) এই প্রবিধানমালায় ভিন্নর্রপ যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন উপযুও্র কর্তৃপক্ষ কোন কারণ না দর্শাইয়াই কোন কর্মচারীকে নব্বই দিনের নোটিশ দান করিয়া অথবা নব্বই দিনের বেতন নগদ পরিশোধ করিয়া তাহাকে চাকুরী হইতে অপসারণ করিতে পারিবেন।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>25.</strong> The identical regulation of Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 and Bangladesh Sangbad Sangtha Karmachari Regulation, 1995 states that notwithstanding anything in the regulations, the authority without showing any case may terminate the service of any employee by giving him three months’ notice or in lieu  thereof to pay him three months’ salary in cash. <br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> Admittedly, the order of termination was exercised without formulating any guideline for exercising the power of termination as referred to above.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong> In this connection reliance may be placed on the case of <strong><em>Dr. Nurul Islam vs. Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Population Control and others, 1981 33 DLR (AD)201.</em></strong> In this case, it has been held that since neither the impugned section 9(2) of the Public Servants Retirement Act nor the Rules provide for any principle or guideline for the exercise of discretion by the Government when it proposes to retire a Government servant from amongst a group of Government servants similarly situated and holding similar jobs, there invariably exists the scope for arbitrary exercise of such discretion.  <br/> <br/><strong>28.</strong> It has further been held that if either the impugned Act or the rules made thereunder provided such principle, the minimum requirement of law as showing the existence of some guideline for the exercise of discretion in retiring a government servant who has completed 25 years of service would, I think, be satisfied, thus making it immune from any challenge on the ground of discrimination violative of Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution. I am of the opinion, therefore, that in the absence of such a guideline either in the Act or the rules framed thereunder, section 9(2) of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act (XII of 1974) suffers from unconstitutionality and the impugned action based on it is open to the challenge of being discriminatory and in violation of the equality provisions of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>29.</strong> The Appellate Division, however, did not declare section 9(2) of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 unconstitutional but the order of termination was declared to be void.<br/> <br/><strong>30.</strong> After pronouncement of the judgment of the case of <strong><em>Dr. Nurul Islam vs. Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Population Control and others, 1981 33 DLR (AD) 201, </em></strong>sub-section (2) of section 9 of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 was amended by Ordinance No.I of 1983 by inserting the words “if it considers necessary in public interest to do so”. Therefore, section 9(2) of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 now is a valid legislation.       <br/> <br/><strong>31.</strong> From the judgment referred to above, it appears that the discretion in terminating the employees of the aforesaid two organizations in the absence of any guideline suffered from unconstitutionality and the impugned actions based on it is open to the challenge of being discriminatory and in violation of equality provisions of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>32.</strong> In this connection, reliance may also be placed on the case of <strong><em>Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia Vs. Shri Justice S.R. Tendolkar and others AIR 1958 (SC) 538.</em></strong> In that case, it has been held as under:<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“A statute may not make a classification of the persons or things to whom their provisions are intended to apply and leave it to the discretion of the Government to select or classify the persons or things for applying those provisions according to the policy or the principle laid down by the statute itself for guidance of the exercise of discretion by the Government in the matter of such selection or classification.”</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“If the Government in making the selection or classification does not proceed on or follow such policy or principle, it has been held by this Court, e.g. in Kathi Raning Rawat v. The State of Saurashtra (E) (supra) that in such a case the executive action but not the statute should be condemned as unconstitutional.”  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>33.</strong> Reliance may be placed on the case of <strong><em>Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. and another vs. Brojo Nath Ganguly and another AIR 1986 (SC)1571</em></strong>. In that case, it has been stated that Rule 9(1) of the Service, Discipline and Appeal Rules, 1979 confers upon the Corporation, the power to terminate the service of the permanent employee by giving him three months’ notice in writing or in lieu thereof to pay him the equivalent of three months’ basic pay and dearness allowance. The Supreme Court of India held that such power may be termed as the <strong><em>Henry VIII Clause</em></strong> which is a provision occasionally found in legislation conferring delegated legislative power, giving the delegate the power to amend the delegating Act in order to bring that Act into full operation or otherwise by Order to remove any difficulty and at times giving power to modify the provision of other Acts also. Such a provision had been nick named “<strong><em>The Henry VIII Clause”</em></strong> because “that <strong>King</strong> is regarded popularly as the impersonation of executive autocracy.” The Supreme Court, therefore, concluded that such a clause is opposed to public policy and being opposed to public policy it is void under section 23 of the Contract Act.<br/> <br/><strong>34.</strong> Reliance may also be placed on the case of <strong><em>West Bengal State Electricity Board and others vs. Desh Bandhu Ghosh and others, AIR 1985 (SC) 722</em></strong>. In the above case, the Deputy Secretary was terminated form service under <strong><em>Regulation 34 of the W.B. State Electricity</em></strong><strong><em> Board’s Regulations</em></strong>. The Regulation enabling Board to terminate services of permanent employee ‘by giving three months’ notice or payment of salary for the corresponding period in lieu thereof’. In the said case, it has been held that the regulation is totally arbitrary and confers on the Board a power which is capable of vicious discrimination. It is a naked ‘hire and fire’ rule and its only parallel is to be found in the <strong><em>Henry VIII Clause</em></strong> so familiar to administrative lawyers.   <br/> <br/><strong>35.</strong> Having considered the cases cited above, it appears that a legislation which does not contain any provision which is directly discriminatory may be yet offend against guarantee of equal protection if it confers upon the executive or administrative authority an unguided or uncontrolled discretionary power in the matter of application of the law.<br/> <br/><strong>36.</strong> Therefore, we are of the view that the power exercised under Regulation 55(2) of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 and Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha Employees Service Regulations, 1995 was illegal as there was no guideline formulated for exercise of such power. Consequently, the order of termination made under those provisions of law cannot be sustained in law.<br/> <br/><strong>37.</strong> In Civil Appeal No. 506 of 2009, it is on record that though initially a departmental proceeding was initiated against the appellants and they were put under suspension pending inquiry, charge sheet-cum-show cause notices were served upon them to which the appellants gave reply denying the allegations brought against them. An inquiry committee was formed behind the back of the appellants and the said committee without following the procedure laid down in the Service Regulation, 1995 and without affording the appellants effective opportunity of hearing arbitrarily prepared a report which was never brought to the notice of the appellants. The order of termination dated 09.09.2003 was made under Regulation No.54(2) of the said Service Regulations, 1995. The employer having passed an order of termination simpliciter without any stigma and that the order having been challenged in a writ petition in the Court on the ground of <em>mala fide</em> and arbitrariness, the employer cannot be allowed to take a plea in the writ proceeding to the effect that in fact, the appellants were found guilty but the authority as an act of grace without inflicting punishment of dismissal awarded order of termination simpliciter.<br/> <br/><strong>38.</strong> Sitting in writ jurisdiction in the nature of certiorari over an order of termination simpliciter without stigma, the High Court Division was wrong in finding the appellants guilty of misconduct placing itself into the role of domestic Tribunal more particularly where admittedly the proceeding initiated was not concluded by service of second show cause notice with proposed punishment and by receiving reply thereof.<br/> <br/><strong>39.</strong> Although the employer passed the order of termination under Regulation 54(2) of the B.S.S. Service Regulations, 1995 in view of the impugned judgment of the High Court Division, the termination of services of the appellants is no longer termination simpliciter but has been converted into order of dismissal with stigma inflicted by the High Court Division.<br/> <br/><strong>40.</strong> Regulation 54(2) of the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha Employees Service Regulations, 1995 does not provide for any guideline for exercise of power of termination under this Regulation and as such, it is prone to and permits the authority its abuse and arbitrary and discriminatory exercise under this Regulation which renders Regulation 54(2) being violative of fundamental right guaranteed by Article 27 of the Constitution.<br/> <br/><strong>41.</strong> In respect of Civil Appeal No. 98 of 2011, the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 having not provided any guideline for exercise of the power of termination of the employees without assigning any reason is violative of fundamental right guaranteed by Article 27 of the Constitution. Regulation 55(2) of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 has been resorted to in a manner and for the purpose and not intended by the legislature and as such, mala fide and arbitrariness of the respondents are apparent on the face of the record. The orders of termination of the appellants by the respondents have been made in abuse of Regulation 55(2) of the Chittagong Port Authority Employees’ Service Regulations, 1991 and as such, the same are dismissal in the garb of termination simpliciter and the High Court Division was wrong in discharging the Rule.<br/> <br/><strong>42.</strong> In Civil Appeal No. 506 of 2009, the authority will, however, be at liberty to initiate the departmental proceeding afresh against the appellants if it wants to do so.<br/> <br/><strong>43.</strong> In the light of the findings made before, both the appeals are allowed and the impugned judgments delivered by the High Court Division are set aside and the orders of termination impugned before the High Court Division are declared to have been passed without lawful authority and are of no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

(15)</strong><br/> <br/><strong><u>For the Plaintiff-appellants</u></strong><br/>Mr. Sk. Shamsul Alam, Advocate<br/> <br/><strong><u>For the Defendant-respondent No. 2</u></strong><br/>Mr. Md. Kamruzzaman, Advocate.<br/> <br/><strong>First Appeal No. 277 of 2011</strong><br/> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><strong><u>S.M. Mozibur Rahman, J:</u></strong><br/> <br/><strong>1.</strong> This appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 16.06.2011 passed by learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Narayanganj dismissing the Title Suit No. 90 of 2005.<br/> <br/><strong>2.</strong> Short fact, necessary for disposal of the Rule, is that the plaintiff No. 2 as the proprietor of the plaintiff-appellant Messrs Jafri Soap and Chemical Industries, took a loan facility of Tk. 80,000/- by opening a C.C pledge account No. 150 and deposited two purchase deeds being Nos. 801 and 8743 respectively as Security for obtaining loan from defendant Agrani Bank Head Office Dhaka. But no Mortgage deed was executed between the plaintiffs and the defendant Bank in the year of 1977. While plaintiff No. 2 was carrying on the said business in the name and style of the plaintiff No. 1 by taking loan and paying up the same from time to time in course of banking transaction with defendant Bank till 1980 all on a sudden in the year of 1980 the defendant Bank stopped to grant loan facility of Tk. 1,31,310/- causing damage of Tk. 1,31,310/- to the plaintiff No. 1 without assigning any reason whatsoever. Plaintiff No. 2 on several occasion requested the defendant Bank to release the purchase deeds shown in schedule-‘B’ of the plaint in favour of the plaintiff No. 1 as the loan facility had already been stopped by the defendant Bank but in vain. Rather, the defendant Bank as plaintiff instituted a suit, being Artho Rin Mortgage Suit No. 38 of 1991 for realization of Tk. 57,83,725/51 in the court of Artha Rin and the then Sub-ordinate Judge, now Joint District Judge, Narayongonj, against one Messrs Jafri Jute Balling and others as defendants which was decreed ex-parte in preliminary form on 27.01.1992.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> Thereafter in the year of 1993 the defendant Bank as decree-holder filed a case, being Mortgage Execution Case No. 25 of 1993 for realization of decreetal amount of Tk. 57,83,725/51 by auction sale of the land shown in schedule-‘A’ of the plaint along with other lands in the Court of Artha Rin Adalat, Narayongonj, against the aforesaid Messrs Jafri Jute Balling and others as judgment-debtors on 07.03.1993. At one stage the auction sale of the suit property mentioned in schedule-‘A’ of the plaint was held at a consideration money of Tk. 35,28,000/00 which is too much lower than its actual value of Tk. 95,00,000/- in favour of one M A Awal (defendant no. 3 of the original suit) on 19/11/2007. The plaintiff No. 1 was neither made party to Artha Rin Mortgage Suit No. 38 of 1991 nor the schedule-A land to the plaint was mortgaged nor the sale deeds were given as security of mortgage by the plaintiffs to the defendant Bank. So, the decree dated 27.01.1992 of Artha Rin Mortgage Suit No. 38 of 1991 is not binding upon the plaintiffs as the land mentioned in schedule ‘A’ as well as the sale deeds shown in schedule ‘B’ of the plaint are not the actual subject Matter of Artha Rin Suit No. 38 of 1991 and Mortgage Execution Case No. 25 of 1993 pending in the Court of Artha Rin Adalat, Narayangonj. The defendant Bank has taken all measures to execute the auction sale of the land noted in schedule-‘A’ of the plaint although it is not so mortgaged in respect of loan sanctioned in favour of Messrs Jafri Jute Balling. So, the plaintiffs have been compelled to file the original suit praying for a declaration that the decree of Artha Rin Suit No. 38 of 91 is not binding upon them along with a separate declaration that auction sale of the suit land at the consideration money of taka 35,28000/-instead of taka 95,00000/- in favour of defendant no.3 held on 19.11.2007 in strength of which sale deed was executed in the name of defendant nos. 3 is illegal, collusive, void and without jurisdiction.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The defendants contested the suit by filing a written statement and contended inter alia that the suit was not maintainable in the form it was instituted. The suit was clearly barred by section 20 of the Artha Rin, Adalat Ain, 2003. Generally denying the material allegations made in the content of the plaint the defendant stated as real fact that the suit was instituted with malafide intention with a view to delay the prayers of the mortgage Execution Case No. 25 of 1993. The plaintiffs have no legal authority to institute a suit under the provision of Artha Rin Adalat Ain. The trial court had rightly dismissed the suit though it ought to have rejected the plaint as it was barred by law of Artha Rin Adalat Rin, 2003. They further contended that admitting the facts of obtaining loan in the name of Messrs Jafri Jute Balling, plaintiff appellant No. 2 filed a petition dated 10.04.1994 in Mortgage Suit No. 38/91 and Mortgage Execution Case No. 25 of 93 with a prayer to set aside the auction sale.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> In view of the above pleadings the learned Trial Court framing the issues as usual and examining 2 P.Ws. and 2 D.Ws. for both sides respectively passed the impugned judgment and decree dismissing the suit after scanning the oral and documentary evidences adduced and produced by both the parties to the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and decree dated 16.06.2011 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court, Narayanganj, dismissing the Title Suit No. 90 of 2005 the appellant preferred this appeal amongst others on the main grounds that the learned trial court did not consider the law, facts, evidences and other relevant papers submitted by the plaintiffs and therefore arrived at a wrong decision. Had the learned court below perused properly all the relevant papers admitted in to evidence by the plaintiff it could not have dismissed the original suit.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> In view of the above situations the only point needs to be decided in this civil appeal is whether the impugned judgment and decree dismissing the original suit is tenable in law or not.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> We have heard the learned lawyers for both sides. Mr. Sk. Shamsul Alam, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the plaintiff-appellants supporting the grounds of the Memorandum of Appeal stated that the learned Joint District Judge, 1<sup>st</sup> Court seriously failed to consider the facts and circumstance of the case and evidence both oral and documentary adduced and produced by both the parties to the suit and as such the impugned judgment and decree are liable to be set-aside. He further submits that the court below erred in law in not considering that the P.W. 2 in his examination in-chief deposed in court “৮০ সালে বাদী ব্যাংকের কাছে ১,৩১,৩১০/- টাকা লোন চান। কিন্তুু বিবাদী ব্যংক সেই Loan দেয় নাই। Loan না দেয়াতে আমাদের ক্ষতি হয়। ব্যবসা বন্ধ হয়ে যায়। আমার দলিল ২টা ফেরৎ চেয়েছিলাম ব্যাংক দেয় নাই।” and as such the impugned judgment and decree are liable to be set-aside. He further submits that the learned trial court erred in law and fact in failing to consider that the said PW 2 further in his examination-in-Chief deposed in Court “আমি” “A” Schedule এর ভূমি Zafri Jute balling এ Mortgage প্রদান করি নাই। Auction Sale টা অবৈধ| Auction Sale এ ৩৫,২৮,০০০/- “A” Schedule এর সম্পত্তি বিক্রী হয়। এই বিক্রয়টা সঠিক হয় নাই। কম মূল্য বিক্রয় হয়েছে। প্রকৃত মূল্য ৯৫,০০,০০০/-টাকা and as such the impugned judgment and decree are liable to be set-aside. He further submits that the court below erred in law and fact in failing to consider that the DW-2 in his examination-in-Chief deposed in Court “১নং বাদী জাফরী সোপ আমাদের থেকে Loan নিয়াছিল| ঋণের বিপরীতে নালিশী সম্পত্তি Mortgage রেখেছিল|” and as such the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Court below is liable to be set aside.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> In support of his arguments, he cited the following decisions given in the case of Tafizul Huq Serker Vs. Bangladesh and others reported in 18 BLD (AD)1998, Page-269, in the case of M. Tariqullah Sikder Vs. Sonali Bank, reported in 12 MLR (HC) 2007, Page 73, in the case of Shamsuddin Ahmed Vs. A.L. Bhuiyan, reported in 1 BCR 1981 AD, Page 257.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> On the other hand Mr. Md. Kamruzzaman, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the defendant-respondent submits that the original suit is totally barred by section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. There is no scope to file a civil suit against any judgment or order passed by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat except otherearise expressly provided in the said Act of 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> In the light of the above arguments agitated by the learned counsel for both sides, we have carefully examined the impugned Judgment and order along with oral and documentary evidences produced by both sides.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> It is admitted that Messrs Jafri Soap and Chemical Industries took loan of Tk. 80,000/- by opening a C.C pledge account No. 150 against which “A” schedule land of the plaint was mortgaged to the defendant bank. But the plaintiff appellants grievance is that respondent bank instituted the mortgage Money Suit No. 38 of 91 and obtained exparte decree against Messrs Jafri Jute Balling. Thereafter, as decree holder Execution Case No. 25 of 93 was initiated by the plaintiff appellant impleading Messrs Jafri Jute Balling as Judgment debtor instead of Messrs Jafri Soap and Chemical Industries. But it has not been clearly mentioned by the appellant plaintiff as to whether the two organization belongs to the same person or Messrs Jafri Jute Balling is the sister organization of the Messrs Jafri Soap and Chemical Industries. Admittedly land shown in A schedule was shown as mortgaged property against the loan money sanctioned infavour of Messrs Jafri Soap and Chemical Industries. In that view of the matter learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat opined accurately that the respondent bank authority correctly instituted the Mortgage Suit No. 38 of 1991 against the plaintiff appellant considering Messrs Jafri Jute Balling as sister organization of Messrs Jafri Soap and Chemical Industries. Learned Trial court further observed that in view of section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 plaintiff appellant cannot institute or raised any question regarding any process or order, judgment and decree passed by the Artha Rin Adalat in any court or to any authority as per section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 which runs as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">ধারা-২০<br/>অর্থ ঋণ আদালতের চূড়ান্ততা<br/>এই আইনের বিধান ব্যতিরেকে কোন আদালত বা কর্তৃপক্ষের নিকট অর্থ ঋণ আদালতে বিচারাধীন কোন কার্যধারা বা উহার কোন আদেশ, রায় বা ডিক্রীর বিষয়ে কোন প্রশ্ন উত্থাপন করা যাইবেন না। এই আইনের বিধানকে উপেক্ষা করিয়া কোন আদালত বা কর্তৃপক্ষের নিকট আবেদন করিয়া কোন প্রতিকার দাবী বা প্রার্থনকরা হইলে ঐরুপ আবেদন কোন আদালত বা কর্তৃপক্ষ গ্রাহ্য করিবে না।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong> In view of above provision of section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 it is seen that without the provisions of Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 any question regarding any proceedings initiated or any order, judgment or decree passed by the Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat cannot be raised in any court or to any authority and no court or authority will take cognizance or accept any application praying for any remedy filed in any court or authority ignoring the said provisions of section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. So we think that learned trial court rightly passed the impugned judgment and decree considering the provision laid down in section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> It should be mentioned here that the learned Advocate for the appellant behemently submitted that changing the name of Messrs Jafri Shop and Chemical Industries the defendant appellant filed the original suit in the name of Messrs Jafri Jute Balling and obtained the exparte decree by practicing fraud upon the court. This submission of the learned Advocate for the plaintiff appellant could be raised in Artha Rin mortgage Suit No. 38 of 1991 by filing a petition for setting aside the exparte decree and thereafter the appellant plaintiffs could have restored the suit in its original file and number in view of the specified section 19 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, which runs as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">ধারা-১৯<br/>একতরফা ডিক্রী সম্পর্কিত বিধান</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">মামলার শুনানীর জন্য ধার্য কোন তারিখে বিবাদী আদালতে অনুপসিহত থাকিলে, কিংবা মামলা শুনানীর জন্য গৃহীত হইবার পর ডাকিয়া বিবাদীকে উপসিহত পাওয়া না গেলে, আদালত মামলা একতরফা সূত্রে নিষ্পত্তি করিবে।</li><li style="text-align:justify">কোন মামলা একতরফা সূত্রে ডিক্রী হইলে, বিবাদী উক্ত একতরফা ডিক্রীর তারিখে অথবা উক্ত একতরফা ডিক্রী সম্পর্কে অবগত হইবার ৩০(ত্রিশ) দিবসের মধ্যে, উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, উক্ত একতরফা ডিক্রী রদের জন্য দরখাস্ত করিতে পারিবেন।</li><li style="text-align:justify">উপ-ধারা (২) এর বিধান অনুযায়ী দরখাস্ত দাখিলের ক্ষেত্রে বিবাদীকে উক্ত দরখাস্ত দাখিলের তারিখের পরবর্তী ১৫(পনের) দিবসের মধ্যে ডিক্রীকৃত অর্থের ১০% এর সমপরিমাণ টাকা বাদীর দাবীর সেই পরিমাণের জন্য স্বীকৃতি স্বর্রপ নগদ সংশ্লিষ্ট আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান, অথবা জামানত স্বরুপ ব্যাংক ড্রাফট, পে-অর্ডার বা অন্য কোন প্রকার নগদায়নযোগ্য বিনিময়ে দলি (Negotiable Instrument) আকারে জামানত হিসাবে আদালতে জমাদান করিতে হইবে।</li><li style="text-align:justify">উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধানমতে ডিক্রীকৃত অর্থের ১০% সমপরিমাণ টাকা জমাদানের সংগে সংগে দরখাস্তটি মঞ্জুর হইবে, একতরফা ডিক্রী রদ হইবে এবং মূল মামলা উহার পূর্বের নম্বর ও নথিতে পুনর্রজ্জীবিত হইবে এবং আদালত ঐ মর্মে একটি আদেশ লিপিবদ্ধ করিবে এবং অতঃপর মামলাটি যে পর্যায়ে একতরফা নিষ্পত্তি হইয়াছিল, ঐ পর্যায়ের অব্যবহিত পূর্ববর্তী পর্যায় হইতে পরিচালিত হইবে।</li><li style="text-align:justify">-----------------------------------------------</li><li style="text-align:justify">---------------------------------------------- </li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16.</strong> But without taking any such step under section 19 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 subsequently filing of a separate suit on the ground of fraud practices upon the court is not maintainable in view of section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. Further more there is a provision of filing appeal and revision against any order or judgment and decree passed by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat in view of section 41 and 42 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. Plaintiff appellant apparently ignoring the provision of section 19 and 41 instituted a separate suit against the impugned judgment and decree which is absolutely barred by section 20 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003. In view of the discussion made above we are of the view that there is no flaw we need to assail in the impugned judgment and decree passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Narayanganj.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> In the result, the appeal is dismissed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> The impugned judgment and decree dated 16.06.2011 passed by learned Joint District Judge, 1st Court, Narayanganj dismissing the Title Suit No. 90 of 2005 be affirmed.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> Send down the L.

The petitioner accordingly contested the said suit by filing written statement. Thereafter, upon hearing the parties, the Artha Rin Adalat, Jessore, by its judgement and decree dated 20.06.2006 decreed the suit against the petitioner and others. Accordingly, the plaintiff-Bank filed Artha Execution Case No. 21 of 2006 on 07.09.2006 for realisation of Tk. 76,58,097/-. During pendency of the said execution case, the judgment-debtor-petitioner filed an application on 23.07.2012 for computing interest on the decretal amount at the rate of 8% in view of the then applicable provisions of law when the decree was passed.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> After hearing the aforesaid application, and objection filed by the decree holder bank, the Adalat by its order dated 21.01.2013 rejected the application of the petitioner and computed the interest as prescribed under Section 50 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain as amended from time to time.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Being aggrieved by the order dated 21.01.2013, the petitioner filed Writ Petition No. 4886 of 2013 before the High Court Division and obtained Rule, which upon hearing the parties, was discharged. Hence, the petitioner is now before us having filed the instant civil petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Mr. Nurul Islam Chowdhury, learned Advocate-on-Record appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the High Court Division passed the judgement and order relying on a decision passed by an Indian Court which is not relevant to the case of the petitioner as the facts leading to the said decision regarding non-payment of taxes on which interest was imposed were different. In the instant case the subject matter is different as the dispute arose out of a judgement and decree passed in an Artha Rin Adalat matter. As such the judgement and order of the High Court Division calls for interference. He further submits that the High Court Division failed to consider that Respondent No. 1 committed error in counting the interest from 23.12.2007 to 24.02.2009 at the rate of 12%, defying the amendment of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003, (Act No. 16 of 2010) which provides that 8% would be replaced by 12%, and that the interest at the rate of 12% would be computed after the above amendment, i.e. after 2010. He lastly submits that the decree was passed in the year 2006 when the applicable rate was 8%, and as such a right accrued in favour of the judgment debtor to pay interest on the decretal amount at the said rate, and hence the accrued right of the petitioner cannot be taken away by subsequent amendments, and in this regard reference may be made to the case of <strong><em>Khondaker Badiuzzaman Vs GM Bangladesh Krishi Bank and others</em></strong> reported in <strong><em>14 BLD 151.</em></strong> As such the judgement and order passed by the High Court Division calls for interference.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> No one appeared for the respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> We have considered the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner and perused the impugned judgement and order of the High Court Division and other connected papers on record.    <br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> The point in issue in this case concerns the rate of interest to be awarded in view of amendment of the legal provision from time to time changing the rate of interest.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> The admitted position is that on the day when the decree was passed section 50 of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (the Ain) provided for interest to be imposed at the rate of 8%. Subsequently, by amendment in 2007 the rate of interest was increased to 12%. The High Court Division observed that the trial Court in awarding the decree ordered that the plaintiff bank is entitled to realize interest as per prescribed rate from 01.04.04 till realization of the decretal amount and went on to hold that this meant that the interest would be applicable at the rate when the order of the Court was passed. The High Court Division further observed that if the petitioner had repaid the entire decretal amount before the rate of interest was amended then the dispute would not arise.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> The Artha Rin Adalat (Amendment) Ain, 2010, (Act No. 16 of 2010) came into force on 30.3.2010 by which section 50 of the Ain, 2003 was amended increasing the rate of interest from 8% to 12%.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Section 50 (2) of the Ain, 2003, as amended, provides as follows: <br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">"৫০। (২) অর্থঋণ আদালত কর্তৃক প্রদত্ত ডিত্র্রীর বিরুদ্ধে বিবাদী-দায়িক পক্ষ কোন আপীল, রিভিশন, আপীল বিভাগে বা অন্য কোনরূপ দরখাস্ত কোন উচ্চতর আদালতে দায়ের না করিলে, মামলা দায়েরের দিবস হইতে ডিক্রির টাকা আদায় হইবার দিবস পর্যন্ত সময়ের জন্য ডিত্র্রিকৃত টাকার উপর ১২% (বার শতাংশ) বার্ষিক সরল হারে, কোন আপীল, রিভিশন বা অন্য কোন দরখাস্ত কোন উচ্চতর আদালতে দায়ের করিলে পূর্বোক্ত সময়কালের জন্য ১৬% (ষোল শতাংশ) বার্ষিক সরল হারে, এবং আপীল বা উচ্চতর আদালতের ডিত্র্রি বা আদেশের বিরুদ্ধে আপীল বিভাগে আপীল করিলে, পূর্বোক্ত সময়কালের জন্য ১৮% (আঠার শতাংশ) বার্ষিক সরল হারে, উপ-ধারা (৩) এর বিধান সাপেক্ষে, সুদ, বা, ক্ষেত্রমত, মুনাফা আরোপিত হইবে।''</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Since the matter is still pending as a money execution case before the Artha Rin Adalat, what rate of interest is to be awarded on appeal before the High Court Division or the Appellate Division is not material in the instant case. However, the rate of interest to be awarded for the period from filing of the suit till the realization of the decretal amount is clearly 12% as from 31.3.2010. We note that interest was calculated at 8% for the period before the Act came into force in force in 2010 because the Ordinance enhancing the rate to 12% was not approved by Parliament from 25.02.2009 to 31.03.2010.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> The High Court Division placing reliance upon a decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of <strong>Maya Rani Punj vs. C.I.T., Delhi (1996) 1SCC-445 </strong>held that the non-payment of the decretal amount by the judgement debtor was a continuing default which meant that each and every day the judgement debtor incurred a liability to pay interest at a rate applicable on that day. With respect, we agree that if the judgement debtor had paid the decretal amount within the period stipulated by the trial Court, then the rate of interest applicable at that time would have been the appropriate rate of interest to be paid. Since the judgement debtor did not pay the decretal amount in accordance with the order of the Court it would be liable to pay at the various rates which may change from time to time.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> It may be noted here that the rate of interest charged at any given time by financial institutions under directions of the Central Bank reflects the prevalent economic condition of the country. If the interest rate was lowered then the judgement debtor would have received the benefit of the lower interest. It cannot be said that any vested right accrued to the judgement-debtor with regard to the rate of interest for all time to come. At best it can be said that within the time for payment as stipulated by the Court the rate of interest would be the same as on the date of the decree. If the Court had specified that the rate would be 8% till realization of the decretal amount then the change of rate of interest would not affect the judgement-debtor detrimentally or beneficially in case the interest was lowered. However, in this case the rate was to be the “prescribed rate from 01.04.2004 till the realization of the decretal money.” ‘Prescribed’ would mean prescribed by law. In the facts of the instant case the ‘prescribed rate’ was amended more than once since 01.04.2004.   <br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Accordingly, we are of the view that the interest to be paid by the judgement debtor will have to be calculated according to the prevailing interest rate or rates, which may be different for different periods, from the time of filing of the suit till the payment of the decretal amount by the judgement debtor.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> In the light of the discussion above, we find that the impugned judgement does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity and does not call for any interference.<br/> <br/>Accordingly, the civil petition for leave to appeal is dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

The Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974 was amended by the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 2010 adding inter alia section 4A, which provides for extension of the period of service to public servants who were freedom fighters from 57 to 59 years of age. The writ petitioners who were on LPR claimed that they would get the  benefit  of  the  provision since the law provided that they would be taken out of LPR and would continue to serve up to the 59<sup>th</sup>  year.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> Pubali Bank Ltd., writ respondent No. 6, petitioner herein, in its affidavit in opposition claimed that the writ petitioners were not public servants as they were under the employment   of a private bank and as such the principle of master and servant was applicable and matters relating to their service was not amenable to the writ jurisdiction, and therefore the writ petition was not maintainable. Moreover, since the bank is not a statutory corporation or a local authority, the employees were bound by the Pubali Bank (Employees) Service Regulations, 1981 which in fact adopted certain provisions from the Public Servants (Retirement) Act, 1974, but the subsequent amended provisions of 2010 have not been incorporated in the Bank’s Service Regulations and hence are not applicable to the writ petitioners.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The High Court Division heard the parties and upon consideration of the submissions  and materials on record, by the impugned judgment and order, disposed  of  the  Rule  suggesting that the Pubali Bank Limited may consider to allow the  petitioners  to  serve  in  their respective posts from 57 to 59 years. The Pubali Bank is now before us with the instant civil petition for leave to appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Mr. Mahmudul Islam, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the writ petitioners relied upon a circular of the Pubali Bank Ltd. dated 31.01.2012 by which the benefits under section 4A of the Public Servants (Retirement) (Amendment) Act, 2010 were given to employees of Pubali Bank Ltd, who were freedom fighters. However, he points out that the said circular was effective from 01.01.2012, whereas the writ petitioner’s LPR period expired long before that. The learned Advocate further submits that, Pubali Bank Ltd, being a private bank, the writ petition was not maintainable as held by the same Bench of the High Court Division in Writ Petition No. 6017 of 2010 wherein judgement was delivered on 13.03.2011 holding that since Pubali Bank Limited was a private bank, the writ petition was not maintainable. He points out further that in the impugned judgement their Lordships of the High Court Division did not decide the question of maintainability of the writ petition, but as a pious wish suggested that since the Board of Directors of the writ respondent Bank had decided to extend the service period of employees from 57 to 59 years, “for the cause of justice, equity and fair play the Pubali Bank Limited may also consider to allow the petitioners to serve their respective posts from 57 to 59 years.”<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> No one has appeared on behalf of the respondents.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> We have decided earlier in <strong><em>Md Anwarul Alam </em><em>Vs. Government of Bangladesh </em></strong><em>in <strong>Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No. 227 of 2012, </strong></em>which arose out of Writ Petition No. 6017 of 2010, that the bank concerned being a company under the Companies Act, does not come within the ambit of article 102(5) of the Constitution. So, we are of the view that the Rule in the instant case ought to have been discharged on the same ground, especially when the same Bench had decided earlier that the employees of Pubali Bank Limited are not in the service of the Republic or of any Corporation, National Enterprise or Local Authority. Moreover, we accept the submission of Mr. Mahmudul Islam that the writ petitioners will not get the benefit of the Bank’s circular dated 31.01.2012 since the writ petitioners’ LPR period had expired prior to the circular coming into force. We also accept that the subsequent amendment to the Public Servants (Retirement) Act 1974 will not be automatically incorporated in the Service Regulations of the Bank, until and unless the Bank chooses to adopt the same by amending the relevant Service Regulations.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> Finally, we find that in this case the learned Judges of the High Court Division merely expressed their wish that the Bank may consider allowing the petitioners to serve up to their age of 59 years since the Board of Directors of the Bank had decided to extend the service period of its employees from 57 to 59 years. However, there was no finding that the petitioners had any such legal right to have their period of service extended up to 59 years of their age. Indeed, in our view the Bank giving such benefits to its employees by means of a circular post dates the writ petitioners’ superannuation and is, therefore, not applicable in their case.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> With the above observations the instant civil petition for leave to appeal is disposed of.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></span></div></div></div>

Here words “Payable” and “has been given to” are very significant, which means that the sum insured is payable when the proof of loss has been informed to the insurers. In other words it means that the amount of insurance is payable when the loss occurred has been communicated to the insurer with proof or the insurer got the information of the occurrence. All these are thus related to intimation to the insurer about the occurrence, and after such communication, the sum insured became payable. The word “loss” has been mentioned in the first and third part of Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act and the word “loss” referred to as an information of the loss to the insurer resulting from an occurrence and thus making the policy of insurance payable. The word “payable” as mentioned in the first part of the Article, relates to cause of action of the suit i.e. the plaintiff after intimation of proof of loss to the insurer the sum insured has become payable and the plaintiff thus entitle to get the same. The starting point of limitation also made clear if we consider Article 86(a) of the Limitation Act. The first part of that Article under the heading “Description of suit” provides that “On a policy of insurance when the sum insured is payable after proof of the death has been given to or received by </strong><strong>the insurers” and the third part of that Article</strong><strong> provide that “The date of the death of the </strong><strong>deceased”.

Further case of the plaintiff is that a fire broke out in the Jute Mill on 25.03.1987 and the same has duly been informed to the defendant-insurer.  The insurer appellant on 31.03.1987 appointed surveyer who filed a report assessing the loss as Tk. 29,53,822.25. The plaintiff on different occasion requested the defendant for payment of the amount of loss; but, the defendant lastly on 07.04.1990, refused to pay the amount and accordingly filed the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The defendant Nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written statement and contended <em>inter-alia, </em>that the suit as filed is barred by limitation and also stated that the plaintiff violated the term Nos. 13 and 19 of the policy and thereby not entitled to get any amount from the defendant insurer and accordingly prayed for dismissal of the suit.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The trial Court framed as many as four issues including an issue as to whether the suit as filed is barred by limitation or not.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> By the impugned judgment and decree the trial Court decreed the suit in part and directed the defendant to pay Tk. 29,53,822.00 with interest. Being aggrieved the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 as appellants filed the instant First Appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Mr. Tufailur Rahman, with Mrs. Sufia Ahmed, the learned Advocates appearing for the defendant-appellants submit that he will press only one ground concerning limitation in filing of the suit. Assailing that ground he referred to Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act, 1908 (herein after referred to as the Limitation Act) and submits that the date of occurrence as has been stated even  in the plaint was 25.03.1987 and the suit has been filed on 22.08.1990 and in view of Article 86(b) of Limitation Act, the suit is barred by limitation and the trial Court without considering the said article most illegally held that the suit is not barred by limitation and accordingly decreed the suit in part, and as such, prays for setting aside the impugned judgment and decree on allowing  the appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> On the other hand Mr. Hassan Shaheed Quamruzzaman, the learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff-respondent submits that in view of the decision reported in 66 DLR 224 a Division Bench of this Court held that the law of limitation runs from the cause of action of a suit and that should be in all cases for 03(three) years not from the date of occurrence. He further submits that in view of the first part of clause-(b) of Article 86 of the Limitation Act, it appears that the proof of loss has to be determined first and accordingly on relying on this decision, submits that the trial Court committed no illegality in holding that the suit is not barred by limitation.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> We have heard the learned Advocates of both the sides, perused the plaint, written statement, depositions, exhibits and the memorandum of appeal.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> The only question as raised in the instant first appeal is, as to whether, the suit as filed, is barred by limitation or not. For considering the same we have gone through the Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act, which reads as follows:<br/> </div><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:373px"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 45px; width: 138px; text-align: justify;">Description of suit</td><td style="height: 45px; width: 107px; text-align: justify;">period of limitation</td><td style="height: 45px; width: 128px; text-align: justify;">Time from which period begins to run.</td></tr><tr><td style="height: 92px; width: 138px; text-align: justify;">86(b).

Since all the questions raised by the learned Advocate for the appellants have already been answered therefore, in our opinion, the appeal itself is without substance.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong> While dealing with Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act, their Lordships mainly considered the first part of clause (b) of Article 86 of the Limitation Act in holding the starting point of limitation, as to be after proof of the quantum of loss.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> Cause of action implies a right to sue. The material facts which are imperative for the suitor to allege and prove constitutes the cause of action. Cause of action is not defined in any statute. It has, however, been judicially interpreted <em>inter alia </em>to mean that every fact which would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court. Negatively put, it would mean that everything which, if not proved, gives the defendant an immediate right to judgment, would be part of cause of action. Its importance is beyond any doubt. For every action, there has to be a cause of action, if not, the plaint, shall be rejected summarily.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> The cause of action has no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant, nor does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff. It refers entirely to the ground set forth in the plaint as the cause of action, or, in other words, to the media upon which the plaintiff asks the court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour.<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> It has been held by the Appellate Division in the case of Surat Sarder and others vs. Afzal Hossain and others, 49 DLR (AD) 99 that;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>“The term “cause of action” has not been defined in the Code of Civil Procedure. Rule 1(e) of Order VII of the Code only provides that besides other particulars, mentioned in different clauses of Rule 1, the plaint shall contain the “facts constituting the cause of action and when it arose”. The cause of action for the suit ordinarily thus, means the cause which leads the plaintiffs to bring a legal action. The incidence of cause of action must be antecedent to the bringing of the suit at a time when the right to sue arose for the first time. It consists of the entire set of facts which gives rise to a legal action and is to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed in the suit. It has little relation either to the defence to be taken by the defendant or the nature of relief to be prayed for by the plaintiff in the suit.”</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong> And also in the case of Tar Muhammad &amp; Co. vs. Federation of Pakistan and others, 9 DLR 197, a Division bench of the then Dacca High Court, held that;<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>Now the cause of action, as it means, denotes a bundle of essential facts which is necessary for the plaintiff to prove before he can succeed in his suit. It has no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant, nor does it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff. It refers entirely in the grounds set forth in the plaint as the cause of action, or, in other words, to the media upon which the plaintiff asks the Court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour.</em></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong> Thus it appears that cause of action does not mean only the date of refusal; but, every fact which would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove his case.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> We have considered the first part of clause (b) of Article 86 of the Limitation Act, which under the heading “Description of Suit” and described the policy of insurance, when the sum insured is payable after proof of the loss has been given to or received by the insurers. Here words “Payable” and “has been given to” are very significant, which means that the sum insured  is payable when the proof of loss has been informed to the insurers. In other  words it means that the amount of insurance is payable when the loss occurred has been communicated to the insurer with proof or the insurer got the information of the occurrence. All these are thus related to intimation to the insurer about the occurrence, and after such communication, the sum insured became payable. The word “loss” has been mentioned in the first and third part of Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act and the word “loss” referred to as an information of the loss to the insurer resulting from an occurrence and thus making the policy of insurance payable. The word “payable” as mentioned in the first part of the Article, relates to cause of action of the suit i.e. the plaintiff after intimation of proof of loss to the insurer the sum insured has become payable and the plaintiff thus entitle to get the same. The starting point of limitation also made clear if we consider Article 86(a) of the Limitation Act. The first part of that Article under the heading “Description of suit” provides that “On a policy of insurance when the sum insured is payable after proof of the death has been given to or received by the insurers” and the third part of the that Article provide that “The date of the death of the deceased”. It thus made it clear that the starting point for the purpose of filing such suit begins from the date of occurrence. From a plain reading of the third part of Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act, which is under the heading “Time from which period begins to run” provides that it shall run from the date of the occurrence causing the loss accordingly there is no doubt that the suit have to filed within three years from the date of occurrence causing the loss. In the instant case the date of occurrence that is the fire broke out in the mill on 25.03.1987, and as such, the suit as filed on 22.08.1990 is hopeless barred by limitation. The view taken by a Division Bench of the High Court Division in the case of Sadharan Bima Corporation and others vs. Golden Twisting Factory &amp; others, 66 DLR 224 and the reasons stated therein are not acceptable in view of the clear provision of Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act. In the present case the third part of Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act is very clear and there is hardly any scope to interpret the same in any other way.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> As we have already held that the language of Article 86(b) of the Limitation Act is very much clear on this point so there cannot be any cause for holding that the limitation shall run from the date of cause of action of the suit i.e. when the claim has been refused, rather in view of this Article, the  limitation for filing of the suit shall run from the date of occurrence causing the loss, i.e. from 25.03.1987.<br/> <br/><strong>23.</strong> In view of the above, we cannot agree with the decision as mentioned above reported in 66 DLR 224.<br/> <br/><strong>24.</strong> Accordingly, we find that the suit as filed is hopelessly barred by limitation, and as such, the suit is liable to be dismissed on this ground.<br/> <br/><strong>25.</strong> Accordingly, the appeal is allowed without any order as to cost.<br/> <br/><strong>26.</strong> The judgment and decree dated 19.10.2003 passed by the learned Joint District Judge, Arbitration Court, Dhaka in Money Suit No. 55 of 1990 is hereby set aside and the suit stand dismissed.<br/> <br/><strong>27.</strong> Send down the Lower Court’s Record with a copy of this judgment to the concerned Court immediately.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

In the year 1984 Government under its “Disinvestment Policy” decided to hand over the said Company to the private sector. Accordingly, the Government published tender notice to sell the said Company. The petitioner as a businessman, along with six other family members participated in a tender floated by the Ministry of Industries for the purchase of shares of the said Company. The said tender was awarded to the petitioner and his family members at Tk.13.77 crores. An agreement for sale was executed on 07.04.1984 between the Ministry of Industries for transfer of shares in the said Company subject to joint audit and verification of all assets including liability to the Respondent No.3 and 4 (hereinafter referred to as the Pubali Bank). The shares of the said Company were never transferred to the petitioner and his family members. As such the petitioner and his family members do not hold any shares in the said Company.<br/> <br/><strong>3.</strong> On 31.10.1992 the petitioner sent a letter to the Pubali Bank for holding necessary audit to determine the actual liability of the said Company. The respondent Pubali Bank, on the other hand, by several letters asked the petitioner to clear up the outstanding dues and requested the respondent – Bangladesh Bank to write off amount of Tk. 53,79,627.00 from the interest account and Tk. 39,92,742.00 from the interest suspended account.<br/> <br/><strong>4.</strong> The Pubali Bank vide its letter No. 7893 dated 05.09.1995 informed the company that the liability of said company stood at Tk. 1,15,03,916.25 and the same amount is payable in two year installments. This liability was determined by the management of the Pubali Bank and approved by its Board of Directors. The respondent Pubali Bank stated in its letter dated 05.09.1995 that for waiver of interest the permission of Bangladesh Bank would be required since the petitioner was a director of Pubali Bank Limited. The Pubali Bank failed to realize that the petitioner merely acted as an authorized representative/agent of the said company. He had no shares in the said company nor was a director of the same. The respondent wrongly associated the petitioner with the debts and liabilities of the said company. So the petitioner is not a defaulter.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> Thereafter several years have gone passed but no solution could be reached between the petitioner and writ respondents for different reasons. In paragraph 35 to 37 regard have been taken on several decisions of the Appellate Division and this Division to highlight that the petitioner company is a artificial person and the loan was taken by an artificial person and in the event of default by such artificial person in repayment of the loan, such default of the company would not ipso facto render any member or director of such artificial person a defaulter. Under the said circumstances the petitioner being aggrieved by the enlistment of his name in the CIB list moved this Division and obtained the present Rule and order of injunction as aforesaid.<br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> Mr. Rafique-Ul Hoque, the learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Muhammad Saifullah Mamun, the learned Advocate for the petitioner after taking us with the petition and the relevant Annexures thereto mainly contends that although the petitioner has been acting as ex-officio Chairman and Managing Director of the Albert Davit (BD) Ltd. but without holding any share of the said company he cannot be held personally liable to pay dues of the Company since he did not give any personal guarantee or undertaking to pay the said liability. The shares of the said company have not yet been transferred in the name of the petitioner. The petitioner has just been acting as the designated Chairman and Managing Director of the said Company for mere management purpose and he is not the proprietor or owner of the same as mentioned above. The shares of the said Company are still lying with the Ministry of Industries. In such situation, the debts and liability of the said Company cannot legally be attributed to the petitioner and hence he is not a defaulter borrower. He further argued that  the  Company paid  Tk.115,03,916.25 to  the Pubali  Bank  as  full  and final settlement of liability of the company according to the decision taken in the 252nd and 683rd Board of Directors Meeting of Pubali Bank.<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Mr. Hoque further submits that enlistment of the name of the petitioner in CIB report showing him as defaulter borrower cannot be sustained in that the elementary principle of Company law is that the company is a legal person and the director is not liable for any debt of the company.   Therefore, the learned Senior Counsel concludes that for the aforesaid reasons the petitioner’s name appearing in the list of CIB showing him as a defaulter borrower should be declared to have been done illegally having no legal effect.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Mr. Md. Mamunur Rashid, the learned Advocate, on the other hand, by filing affidavit-in- opposition on behalf of respondent No.4 Pubali Bank Ltd. opposes the Rule. Mr. Syed Hasan Zobair, the learned counsel by filing affidavit-in-opposition also opposes the Rule appearing on behalf of respondent No.2-Bangladesh Bank. In supplementary affidavit filed by the respondent – Pubali Bank the other version of the case has been depicted in that admittedly the petitioner took loan over the company Albert David (Bangladesh) Ltd. from the Government along with its assets and liabilities vide agreement dated 07.04.1984. Since inception of taking over the company, it had loan liability with the respondent bank. After execution of agreement the petitioner took over the company vide Ref: No.ADL/GM/83-84 dated 07.04.1984. The petitioner after taking over the company applied to the respondent bank on 21.01.1985 for renewal and enhancement of L/C limit of the company pursuant to which loan was renewed and enhanced vide sanction letter dated 09.04.1985. Subsequently the loan was renewed and enhanced/reduced on several times. As security against the loan the petitioner executed various charge documents such as D.P. Note, Letter of continuity, Stock delivery letter, Stock ownership declaration etc. The petitioner also executed personal guarantee as security against the loan.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> The Ref: No.ADL/GM/83-84 dated 07.04.1984, application dated 20.01.1985 for renewal and enhancement of loan, renewal of loan vide sanction letter dated 09.04.1985, charge documents and personal guarantee have been annexed to the petition and marked as Annexure- 3, 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e),  3(f) and 3(g).<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> It has been submitted that on application of the petitioner the liabilities of the company was rescheduled vide HO/CD/5614/2001 dated 28.08.2001 which was communicated to the petitioner vide respondent bank’s letter No.PBL/HO/CD/6034/2001 dated 12.09.2001. The petitioner having accepted the reschedulement submitted a cheque for Tk.1,03,53,524.62. Regarding the cheque respondent bank wrote a letter to the petitioner on 27.08.2001 informing him that his cheque would have been accepted by the bank had he given an undertaking in writing that the cheque amount was for down payment against its total liabilities of Tk. 4,69,54,072.62 as on 31.03.2001. Thereafter the petitioner confirmed that cheque for Tk.1,03,53,524.62 was made as down payment of liabilities of Albert David (Bangladesh) Ltd.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> The learned counsel further submits that existence of the company could not be imagined of without the petitioner. The petitioner was all in all of the Albert Davit (Bangladesh) Ltd. He took over the company being a successful bidder along with its assets and liabilities. After taking over the company its loan was renewed, enhanced and rescheduled on his application. He deposited the down payment after reschedulement. All the loan amount used to be drawn by cheque under his own signature. So he is wholly &amp; solely responsible for the defaulted loan liabilities of the company. In law a company is an artificial juristic person. If it is so, then Albert Davit (Bangladesh) Ltd. may be considered as a body of which the petitioner Mr. Shafi A. Choudhury is its heart/soul. The respondent bank filed Artha Rin Suit No.45/2003 in the Artha Rin Court, No.3, Dhaka against the company Albert Davit (Bangladesh) Ltd. impleading the petitioner as its sole responsible person. The suit has been decreed on 25.04.2012 against the petitioner. As such it has been established by the Court’s verdict that the petitioner is the only person wholly and solely responsible for repayment of liabilities of the company.<br/> <br/><strong>12.</strong> Therefore, on the basis of above submissions the learned counsel for the respondent–Pubali Bank as well as Bangladesh Bank by summing up their arguments unequivocally submit that according to Article 43 and 44 of Chapter IV of the Bangladesh Bank Order 1972, Bangladesh Bank is empowered to collect credit information from banks and financial institutions. On the basis of the credit information provided by the concerned Bank or financial Institution, Bangladesh Bank prepares the CIB  report  of the concerned  persons  and organizations  in  good faith in  order  to discharge its statutory obligations. However, exact information supplied by the Banks/Financial Institutions is contained in the CIB database without any amendment or alternation in terms of the statute. In the instant petition, the issue whether the writ petitioner was a defaulter or not, whether he was guarantor or not, whether he was a director or not can be determined only through evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the case which is best known to the lender Bank who is the relevant party in the petition. As per the statute Bangladesh Bank is empowered to discharge its duty which they did in the present case and there is no illegality in that respect on the part of Bangladesh Bank and as such the instant Rule is liable to be discharged so far as it relates to the Bangladesh Bank.<br/> <br/><strong>13.</strong> We have heard the learned counsel of both sides and considered their submissions carefully. We have gone through the entire Annexures of the petition and affidavit-in-oppositions filed by the respondents with precision. At the outset we want to refer to the agreement for sale entered into between the Government of Bangladesh the 1st  party and  M/S. Albert Davit (Bangladesh) Ltd. as  the 2nd party. In the said agreement the petitioner Shafi A. Choudhury put his signature on behalf of the 2<sup>nd</sup> party i.e.  the Company. Let  us refer  to a  pertinent portion  of the said agreement  dated 07.04.1984, which is as under:<br/>        </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">“NOW, THEREFORE, this indenture witnesseth as follows : - 1. THE FIRST PARTY agrees to sell and the shareholders and the highest bidder of the SECOND PARTY agree to purchase of the demised enterprise on “AS IS Where Is Basis” on the 7th April, 1984 on the terms and conditions set out in the following paragraph.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>14.</strong> Admittedly the petitioner himself on behalf of the company has taken loan from respondent– Pubali Bank by executing all the charge documents of the bank. The petitioner does not also dispute the fact of taking loan and other issues which are long standing unsettled matters mainly related to the payment of loan taken by him of course on behalf of the company. <u>There is no denying that the elementary principle of company law is that the company is a legal entity distinct from of its members. </u>We distinctly observe that though the Company Law governs its field with all the trappings of its own but at the same time the Banking Companies Act is also an independent Special law that rules with authority altogether the different aspect related with the banking matter and stands absolutely on a different footing. <u>By inducting the above elementary principle of company law the cause of action which has arisen under the Banking law cannot be given a go by. </u>This sort of exercise should not be approved in any manner being beyond the scope of jurisprudence. Therefore, we hold that the inference since the petitioner is the Chairman and Managing Director of the Company which is an artificial person and for that reason he is absolved from the clutches of taking loan from the respondent-bank has no backup of law and no legs to stand.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Banking Companies Act has an epitome of its own. <u>When the provisions of the banking Companies Act will be in derogation to other provisions of other laws, then the provisions specifically provided in the Act shall have to be followed only</u>. In the case of Belal Hossain –Vs- Kazi Jane Alam and others, 13 MLR (AD) 74 our Appellate Division have held that section 2 of the Act, 1991 provides that provision of said Act shall not affect the provisions of any other law for the time being in force and <u>also not in addition to the provision of any other existing law</u>. (All underlings are mine)<br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> Under the backdrop of the discussion as made above let us now go through the laws in the amended Bank Companies Act 1991 since it is the next approach to appreciate the cardinal issue before  us.  Firstly let  us  glean the law that  governs  the  method of enlistment  of the names  of the defaulter persons and also স্বার্থ সংশিষ্টস্ন প্রতিষ্ঠান in the CIB list. Law is very much clear and unambiguous. An elaboration and expansion of the law has been perfected by the amendment in the year 2013 (By Act No.27). The life line of the law in the context of the case in hand is section 5 GaGa which has categorized a defaulter borrower or so to say has given the definition of defaulter borrower. Amended section 5 GaGa runs as follows:-<br/> </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">৫(গগ) খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতা অর্থ <u>কোন দে নাদার  ব্যক্তি </u> বা প্রতিষ্ঠান  যাহার  নিজের  বা স্বার্থ সংশিষ্টস্ন প্রতিষ্ঠানের  অনুকুলে  প্রদত্ত অগ্রীম ঋণ, বা উহার  অংশ বা উহার  উপর  অর্জিত সুদ  বাংলাদে শ ব্যাংক কর্তৃক জারীকৃত  সংজ্ঞা অনুযায়ী মেয়াদোত্তীর্ণ   হও য়ার  ৬ (ছয়) মাস অতিবাহিত হইয়াছে :<br/>তবে শর্ত থাবে যে, খেলাপী গ্রহীতা কোন পাবলি ক লি মিটেড কোমপানীর  পরি চাল ক না হইলে  অথবা উক্ত কোম্পানীতে তাহার  বা উহার  শেয়ারে র  অংশ ২৫% এর  অধিক না হইলে , উক্ত  পাবলি ক লি মিটেড কোম্পানী স্বার্থ সংশিষ্টস্ন প্রতিষ্ঠান বলি য়া গণ্য হইবে না ।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>17.</strong> The legislature in the said amended law inserted the word “দেনাদার” and cleared the ambiguity whatsoever or at all in respect of definition and scope of defaulter borrower. Further in section 5 (Chha) of the Banking Companies Act definition of “দেনাদার‘‘ has been given in the following manner : -<br/>৫(ছ) দেনাদার  অর্থ লাভ  ক্ষতির  ভাগাভাগি, খরিদ  বা ইজারার  ভিত্তিতে বা অন্য কোন ভাবে আর্থিক সুযোগ সুবিধা গ্রহণকারী ব্যক্তি কোম্পানী বা প্রতিষ্ঠান  এবং কোন জামিনদার ও  ইহার  অমত্মর্ভূক্ত  হইবে।<br/>  <br/>Section 27 KaKa stands as it is:<br/>  </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">২৭কক।  খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতার  তালি কা- ইত্যাদি ।  (১) প্রত্যেক ব্যাংক কোম্পানী  বা আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান , সময় সময়, উহার  খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতার  তালিকা বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকে প্রেরণ করিবে।<br/>(২) উপ-ধারা (১) এর  অধীন প্রাপ্ত তালি কাবাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক দেশের সকল ব্যাংক কোম্পানী ও আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানে প্রেরণ করিবে।<br/>(৩) কোন খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতার অনকুলে কোন ব্যাংক কোম্পানী বা আথির্ক প্রতিষ্ঠান কোনরূপ ঋণ সুবিধা প্রাদান করিবে না।<br/>(৪) আপাতত: বলবৎ অন্য কোন আইনে যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতার বিরম্নদ্ধে ঋণ প্রদানকারী ব্যাংক কোম্পানী বা  ক্ষে ত্র মত আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান প্রচলি ত আইন অনুসারে  মামলা দায়ের  করিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>18.</strong> If we evaluate all these the laws having bearing on the issue together with the factual aspect of  the case it becomes clear that the agreement that was executed in the year 1984 clearly speaks that the petitioner bought the incumbent company (“AS IS Where Is Basis”) assuming all the liabilities of the same. Further we have already stated that there is no dispute that the petitioner in his individual capacity obtained the loan from the respondent-Pubali Bank after furnishing charge documents and complying with the other boundened formalities. And Banking Companies Act has pinpointed the situation that leads to enlistment of the name of any defaulter borrower <strong>(†`bv`vi</strong><em>) </em>in the CIB list. In many a decision the Appellate Division and this Division finally set at rest that the process of enlistment of any defaulter name in the CIB  list  is  a  continuing process  within  the  meaning  of  section 5 GaGa read with section 27 KaKa of Banking Companies  Act  1991  and  also  read  with  Article 42 of Bangladesh Bank Order 1972. If all these provisions are read together one and only inference that could be made is that if any person or a company is indebted to in any manner with any financial institution and the debt remains unpaid, it is the duty of the respondent Bangladesh Bank in its turn to enlist the name of the incumbent in the CIB list nothing more nothing less. With the amendment of section 5 GaGa the definition as it could be found now contains a wider version of the category of persons to be included as defaulter borrower.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> That being the situation we hold that the main argument of Mr. Rafique-Ul Hoque is a fallacious one under the facts and circumstances of the present case. By bringing the elementary principle of company law as it has been stated the settled provision of Banking Companies Act cannot be given a go by. The petitioner herein is indeed a defaulter borrower within section 5 GaGa read with section 27 KaKa of the Bank Company Act and Article 42 of Bangladesh Bank Order 1972.<br/> <br/><strong>20.</strong> On the conspectus, the irresistible result that follows that this Rule should be discharged with cost.<br/> <br/><strong>21.</strong> In the result, the Rule is discharged with cost. The order of stay granted earlier by this Court is hereby recalled and vacated.<br/> <br/><strong>22.</strong> Communicate this order at once..     <br/> <br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div></div></div>

It appears from Section 27kaka of  the Bank Companies Act, 1991, that granting of loan to a person whose name has been included as a loan defaulter in the CIB list, by granting him such loan or by rescheduling the loan or extending any other credit facilities, it is practically redeeming a person from the classification of loan defaulter within the definition provided in Section 5GaGa of Bank Companies Act, 1991, since the law is very clearly laid out in section 27 KaKa on the point. As is evident, sub-section 3 of section 27 KaKa  unambig-uously states that no loan defaulter shall be accorded any kind of loan facilities. Therefore, the moment, through reschedu-lement of loan facilities or by any other manner any sort of financial assistance is granted to any such person, he can no more be classified nor by any other manner be treated as a loan defaulter within the meaning of section 5 GaGa of the Bank Companies Act, 1991 or under any other law. The exercise of any statutory power by the public functionaries must be just, fair, reasonable, transparent, bonafide, and their actions must be consistent ,and, as such, the impugned CIB list maintained by the office of the respondent Nos. 1-3, showing the petitioners as a loan defaulter while simultaneously rescheduling the loan is a self contradictory act on the part of the respondents and is in clear violation of the relevant provisions of law, in particular the provisions of sub-section 3 of Section  27 KaKa of the Bank Companies Act, 1991. </strong><strong>Therefore, inclusion of the petitioner’s names</strong><strong> in the CIB list is unlawful being in contravention of the statutory provisions provided for in the Bank Companies Act, 1991 and is in utter disregard of the funda-mental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under the constitution....

Razzakul Hossain who is the Managing Director of Petitioner no.1, Sohel Textile Mills Limited.<br/> <br/><strong>5.</strong> The respondent no.1 is Bangladesh Bank represented by its governor, i.e. the respondent no.2, is governor Bangladesh Bank, respondent no.3 is the General Manager of Credit Information Bureau, (hereinafter called as CIB) Bangladesh Bank, the respondent no.4 is United Commercial Bank Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter called as UCBL) represented by its Managing Director while respondent no.5 is a Branch of the respondent no.4 represented by its Branch Head. <br/> <br/><strong>6.</strong> The facts leading to the Rule  of Writ Petition No. 12210 of 2013 in short,  is that the petitioner is a registered Private Limited Company and in course of its business the respondent nos. 4 and 5 allowed the petitioners to enjoy various credit facilities of Tk. 36,11,98,288.58 inter-alia,  through negotiation of some letter of credits for its export business and at one stage the petitioner failing to pay the monthly installments against credit facilities and failing to adjust all the local and foreign export proceeds according to payment schedule became defaulter and upon the petitioner’s failure to pay the outstanding dues within a certain period , the respondent no.5 the branch office of UCBL with consent of the respondent no.1 Bangladesh Bank had written-off the entire claim amount ,and, thereafter, the respondent no.5 under instruction of respondent no.4 the Head Office of UCBL filed Artha Rin Suit No. 140 of 2009 against the petitioner impleading them as defendants for realization of the outstanding dues of Tk. 36,11,98,288.58 including interest. The petitioners duly appeared in the Artha Rin Suit and subsequently approached the respondent no.5 the branch office of UCBL for adjustment of written-off liabilities through a letter dated 14.03.2010 and upon consideration of the said approach, the respondent no.5 on 08.08.2010 referred the matter to its Head Office (the respondent no.4) for necessary actions.  In pursuance of the matter, the respondent no.4 through its Board decision dated 23.05.2011  arrived at a decision to settle the matter and subsequently reached an agreement of understanding executed on 09.06.2011 and in pursuance of such agreement both the parties i.e. the petitioners and the respondent nos. 4 and 5 filed a solenama in the Artha Rin Suit No. 140 of 2009 and the Artha Rin Adalat upon appreciation of the said Solenama and upon duly examining the parties allowed the Solenama by its order dated 15.01.2012 and accordingly a Sole-decree was drawn on 22.01.2012 by the said Adalat. After the said Sole decree in respect of outstanding dues, the respondent no.3 the General Manager of CIB did not take any appropriate action to strike off  the  name of the petitioners from the CIB list though the petitioners have been paying regular installments to the respondent no.5, Thereafter, the petitioners approached the respondent no.5, the Branch office of the UCBL to issue a clearance certificate in respect of reschedulement of the outstanding amount and in pursuance of the matter the respondent no. 5 issued a certificate on 10.10.2013 to that effect which is marked as Annexure-‘D’ in Writ Petition No. 12210 of 2013. In spite of reschedulement of the credit facilities, the petitioners are facing problems in seeking fresh credit facilities from other banks, when the concerned bank enquired about the status of the petitioner from the respondent no.3,the respondent no. 1 in proceeding for credit facilities sought by the petitioners, and, thereafter, without finding any alternative the petitioners through their Advocate served a notice demanding justice on 26.11.2013  with registered post to the respondent nos. 1-3 with a copy of the same to the respondents no. 4 and 5 requesting the respondent nos. 1-3 for taking appropriate action to strike out the name of the petitioners from the CIB list  maintained by respondent no.3. After receiving the aforesaid notice, the respondents neither yet informed the petitioners or their lawyer that they have struck out the name of the petitioners from the said CIB list nor did they take any action according to the request of the petitioners and at this stage the petitioner moved this Division and obtained the present Rule. (Annexure-E).<br/> <br/><strong>7.</strong> Learned Advocate Mr. A.K.M. Asiful Haque appeared on behalf of the petitioner, while learned Advocate Mr. Ali Mustafa Khan by filing an Affidavit-in-opposition represented the respondent no.5, Branch office of the UCBL.<br/> <br/><strong>8.</strong> Learned Advocate Mr. A.K.M. Asiful Haque on behalf of the respondent Nos. 1-3 submits that in spite of reschedulement of the credit facilities in terms of the sole decree and the clearance certificate granted by the respondent no.5 and in spite of request made to the respondent nos. 1- 3, they are unlawfully maintaining the name of the petitioners in the CIB list. The learned Advocate for the petitioners assails that once the reschedulement was granted in terms of the sole decree and clearance certificate was given to that effect by the respondent no.5, the respondent nos. 1- 3 have no legal right to include the name of the petitioner in the CIB list. He contends that by including the name of the petitioners in the CIB list maintained by the respondent no.3, the respondent nos. 1- 3 are violating the statutory provisions provided in section 27 KaKa of the Bank Companies Act and such acts of the respondent nos. 1- 3 being conflictive with the statutory provisions of the Act, the Rules therefore should be made Absolute for ends of Justice.<br/> <br/><strong>9.</strong> On the other hand, learned Advocate Mr. Ali Mustafa Khan for the respondents  by filing an affidavit-in-opposition opposes the Rule and argues that even after issuance of the certificate by the respondent no.5, the petitioner violated the terms of the compromise with respondent no.5 and also assails that the respondent ‘merely’ issued a certificate to the effect that the petitioner had a written off liability of Tk. 36,11,98,288.58 with the respondent no.5 and he further asserts that “mere” issuance of a certificate does not imply that the petitioner has no liability with the respondents, and, therefore, the petitioner is definitely a defaulter within the terms of section 5 GaGa of Bank Companies Act, 1991 and persuades that the Rules ought to be discharged.<br/> <br/><strong>10.</strong> We have heard the Learned Advocates, perused the documents and other materials placed before us. From perusal of the same, it transpires that though the petitioner’s name was included in the CIB list, yet at one stage in Artha Rin Suit No. 140 of 2009, a sole decree was drawn upon mutual compromise and the credit facilities were rescheduled within the terms of the sole decree and in pursuance of the terms of the sole decree respondent no.5 also issued a clearance certificate, the first one dated 10.10.2013 and subsequently another one dated 08.03.2015, which is marked in the supplementary-affidavit as Annexure-‘E’ filed by the petitioners. But it is also evident from the records as is placed before us that the petitioners  had informed them of the current status in consequence of the sole decree and the notice demanding justice and requested the respondent nos. 1- 3 to that effect, but as is obvious from the records of the respondent nos. 1- 3, particularly the respondent no.3 i.e. General Manager of CIB remained passive in this matter and failed to take any steps from excluding and cancelling the name of the petitioner from the CIB list. The learned Advocate for the petitioner had contended, that in spite of having full knowledge of subsequent reschedulement status of the petitioner, in accordance with the statutory provisions of law, and, thereafter, the respondent Nos. 1-3  failure to exclude the petitioner’s name from the CIB list is clearly in violation of the provisions of section 27 KaKa of the Bank Companies Act, 1991.<br/> <br/><strong>11.</strong> Now let us take a look into the relevant provisions of section 27 KaKa of the Bank Companies Act, 1991 which reads as follows:</div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/><strong>২৭ কক। </strong>খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতার তালিকা, ইত্যাদি (১) প্রত্যেক ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী বা আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান, সময় সময়, উহার খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতাদের তালিকা বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকে প্রেরণ করিবে।<br/>২। উপ-ধারা (১) এর অধীন প্রাপ্ত তালিকা বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক দেশের সকল ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী ও আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠানে কোনরূপ ঋণ সুবিধা প্রদান করিবে না।<br/>৩। কোন খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতার অনুকূলে কোন ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী বা আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান কোনরূপ ঋণ সুবিধা প্রদান করিবেনা।<br/>৪। আপাততঃ বলবৎ অন্য কোন আইনে যাহা কিছুই থাকুক না কেন, খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতার বিরুদ্ধে ঋণ প্রদানকারী ব্যাংক-কোম্পানী বা ক্ষেত্রমত, আর্থিক প্রতিষ্ঠান প্রচলিত আইন অনুসারে মামলা দায়ের করিবে।</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>12.</strong> We have very minutely examined sections 27 KaKa particularly Sub-Section 3 of Section 27 KaKa, where it is unequivocally stated that no banking company or financial institutions shall grant any kind of loan facilities in favour of any defaulter borrower. Therefore, upon an interpretation of the law, it is our considered view that the moment a bank or any other financial institutions reschedules a loan or grants any kind of loan, credit facilities or any other sort of financial assistance infavour of any person, it is  virtually an admission on its part that the person to whom such financial assistance is being granted is not a loan defaulter under the definition provided in Section 5 GaGa of Bank Companies Act,1991. Section 5GaGa clearly defines the class of persons who come within the definition of a loan defaulter which reads as follows: </div><div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><br/>“৫(গগ) খেলাপী ঋণ গ্রহীতা অর্থ কোন ব্যক্তি বা প্রতিষ্ঠান, যাহার নিজের বা স্বার্থ সংশ্লিষ্ট প্রতিষ্ঠানের অনুকুলে প্রদত্ত অগ্রীম, ঋণ বা উহার অংশ বা উহার উপর অর্জিত সুদ বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক কর্তৃক জারীকৃত সংজ্ঞা অনুযায়ী মেয়াদোর্ত্তীর্ণ হওয়ার ৬ (ছয়) মাস অতিবাহিত হইয়াছে।<br/>৫(ছ) দেনাদার অর্থ লাভ-ক্ষতির ভাগাভাগি, খরিদ বা ইজারার ভিত্তিতে বা অন্য কোনভাবে আর্থিক সুযোগ সুবিধা গ্রহণকারী ব্যক্তি কোম্পানী বা প্রতিষ্ঠান এবং জামিনদার ইহার অন্তর্ভুক্ত হইবে।”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"> <br/><strong>13.</strong> Therefore, as is obvious from a comparison of the relevant sections particularly Sub-section 3 of section 27 kaka where it is quite unambiguously laid down that a “loan defaulter” shall not be entitled to the benefits of any loan or any other credit facilities by any bank or any financial institutions in the country and from our interpretation of the law particularly section 27kaka of the Bank Companies Act, 1991, we are of the view that granting of loan to a person whose name has been included as a loan defaulter in the CIB list, by granting him such loan or by rescheduling the loan or extending any other credit facilities, it is practically redeeming a person from the classification of loan defaulter within the definition provided in Section 5GaGa of Bank Companies Act, 1991, since the law is very clearly laid out in section 27 KaKa on the point. We find a paradox both in their actions and in terms of the relevant law, that the respondents on the one hand declares the petitioner a loan defaulter while on the other hand they do not hesitate to reschedule loan facilities to him.<br/> <br/><strong>14.</strong> As is evident, sub-section 3 of section 27 KaKa  unambiguously states that no loan defaulter shall be accorded any kind of loan facilities. Therefore, our considered view is that the moment, through reschedulement of loan facilities or by any other manner any sort of financial assistance is granted to any such person, he can no more be classified nor by any other manner be treated as a loan defaulter within the meaning of section 5 GaGa of the Bank Companies Act, 1991 or under any other law. The exercise of any statutory power by the public functionaries must be just, fair, reasonable, transparent, bonafide, and their actions must be consistent ,and, as such, the impugned CIB list maintained by the office of the respondent Nos. 1-3, showing the petitioners as a loan defaulter while simultaneously rescheduling the loan is a self contradictory act on the part of the respondents and is in clear violation of the relevant provisions of law, in particular the provisions of sub-section 3 of Section  27 KaKa of the Bank Companies Act,1991.<br/> <br/><strong>15.</strong> Under the foregoing facts and circumstances, our conclusion is that inclusion of the petitioner’s names in the CIB list is unlawful being in contravention of the statutory provisions provided for in the Bank Companies Act, 1991 and is in utter disregard of the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed under the constitution.      <br/> <br/><strong>16.</strong> In that view of the matter, we find substance in the Rules and are of the view that all the 3 (three) Rules ought to be made absolute.<br/> <br/><strong>17.</strong> Consequently, the enlistment of the petitioner’s name in the CIB list by the office of the respondent Nos. 1-3 treating the petitioners as a loan defaulter is declared to have been passed without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect.   <br/> <br/><strong>18.</strong> In the result, all the 3 (three) Rules are made absolute without any order as to costs.<br/> <br/><strong>19.</strong> Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the office of the Bangladesh Bank, Bangladesh Bhaban, Motijheel, Dhaka for future reference and guidance.<br/> <br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>
