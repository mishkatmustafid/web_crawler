Subsequently however the plaintiff made an application under Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure and also made added prayer for recovery of khash possession.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The facts of the case of the plaintiff inter alia, is that the suit land was acquired by the Public Works Department (P.W.D) and subsequently the land leased by the P.W.D to different persons and the suit land was obtained in lease by one Mr. Jalal Ahmed from the P.W.D following due procedure and he also obtained possession thereof in the suit land and after  the death of Jalal Ahmed his wife, two sons and three daughters became his lawful heirs and they gave power of attorney to one Mr. Salim through two registered deeds being Nos.1416 of 1995 on 16.04.1995 and 2502 of 1995 on 19.11.1995 respectively primarily with the power to supervise and transfer and the plaintiff purchased the suit land from the said power of attorney holder. While in possession of the suit land a dispute arose with the defendant No.1, a businessman and developer and that one stage he went up to Ministry of Public Works and the concerned Ministry advised them to settle the dispute lawfully by taking resort to law. The defendant No.1 conspired against the plaintiff and in consequence the power of attorney given to Md. Salim was ultimately revoked unlawfully on 08.03.2007 and the suit land was also mutated in their names for further approval of construction and building plan in the suit land.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The defendant No.1 filed a written statement denying all the material allegations against him and stated that the legal heirs of the original case while in possession of the property upon paying due taxes and constructing building thereupon was residing therein. At one stage being in need of  money, they decided to sell the suit land to the  defendant No.1through registered kabala No.2817 of 2007 and in pursuance the defendant No.1 after depositing due taxes etc, obtained approval of construction and building of the suit land from the concerned authorities The defendant No.1 also states that while transferring the same, Md. Salim the power of attorney holder transferring the suit land did not obtain permission from the relevant concerned authorities i.e. Ministry of Public Works and Housing whereas the legal heirs of the original lessee before transferring the suit land  to the defendant No.1obtained due permission from the concerned Ministry.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Sk. Zulfiqur Bulbul Chowdhury with Mr. Md. Abdul Matin Sardar the learned Advocates appeared on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant while Mr. Mizan Sayeed with Ms. Farzana Rashid the learned Advocates appeared on behalf of the defendant-respondents to oppose the appeal.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Sk. Zulfiqur Bulbul Chowdhury, the learned Advocate for the plaintiff-appellant submits that he had purchased the suit land from the power of attorney holder by dint of the power of attorney given to the holder by the legal heirs of the original lessee by registered deed No.2109 on 25.07.2000 and asserts that he also got his name mutated following a lawful mutation case and opened B.S. khatian in his name in addition to paying rents up to the year 2010. He contends that the subsequent revocation of the power of attorney by the legal heirs of the original lessee does no cast any cloud on his title, since the power of attorney given to him by the legal heirs of Jalal Ahmed was a valid one and the suit land was sold to him by Md. Salim the power of attorney holder. He pursued that he is a bona-fide purchaser of the property with value in good faith and therefore the subsequent revocation does no cast any cloud on his Title. The learned Advocate however admits that the plaintiffs are not in possession of the suit land and was dispossessed on 05.05.2010 by the defendant No.1. He persuaded that the Trial Court committed serious illegality in not granting him a temporary injunction, since it is “evident” that the plaintiff is the lawful holder of Title to the property. The learned Advocate for the appellant draws our attention to Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act and submits that in keeping with the provisions of Section 48 of the T.P. Act the plaintiff’s title deed being earlier in time will prevail upon the defendant No.1’s but he contends that the Trial Court without taking into consideration these factors, upon a serious error of law and fact rejected the prayer for temporary injunction and thereby committed serious illegality and submits that therefore the Rule is liable to made absolute. </li><li style="text-align:justify">On the other hand, Mr. Mizan Sayeed, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the defendant-respondents opens his submissions by drawing our attention to the fact that no permission from the concerned authorities was taken by the power of attorney holder Md. Salim while selling the suit land to the plaintiffs. In pursuance to his contention he reiterates upon the point that according to the relevant rules, while transferring property permission has to be obtained mandatorily from the concerned ministry or any other authority by dint of delegated power. But he asserts that in this case the power of attorney holder did not take any such permission to sell the suit land from the concerned authorities. He also takes us through the standard agreement which has been marked as Annexure-“B” of the application for vacating the order of status-quo filed by the respondent. He specifically takes us to Clause 11 and Clause 20 of the lease agreement. He points out that prior permission from the lessor is mandatory before transferring the lease hold property under Clauses II of the original standard lease agreement dated 30.04.1981 and no transfer of the demised property without sanction of the lessor shall be valid, binding or effective under Clause 20 of the original lease deed. He further contends that the date of dispossession of the suit land was also not correctly stated by the plaintiff appellants. He points out that in para 7 and 13 of the counter affidavit, the appellant stated the date of dispossession as 25.02.2008 but in his oral submissions the appellant submitted that he was dispossessed on 05.05.2010. In context of such inconsistencies of the Appellant,  he contends that the plaintiff having been not in possession and not having obtained valid permission while the suit land was transferred to him, hence he could not make out any prima-facie case in his favour and the Trial Court lawfully and correctly rejected his application for temporary injunction.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Heard the learned Advocates for both sides, perused the application and all the materials available on record, wherefrom it significantly transpires that the plaintiffs while purchasing the suit land did not obtain permission from the relevant authorities. On the other hand, it is apparent from the records that the legal heirs of the original lessee while selling the suit land to the defendant No.1 developer obtained necessary permission of the concerned Ministry. The learned Advocate for the appellant while making his submissions however assailed that not taking permission is a mere ‘irregularity’ and not an illegality.</li><li style="text-align:justify">On the other hand, Learned Advocate for the respondents submits that since the appellant did not take permission from the authorities’  the sale of the suit land to the plaintiff by the power of attorney is a nullity and  void  ab-initio since obtaining permission from the concerned  authorities is a mandatory provision of the relevant Rules. We have examined the records and it is evident from Annexure-‘B’ of the application for vacating the order of status-quo by the respondents, where the proviso of clause 20 of the standard lease agreement actually makes it expressly mandatory for   prior approval of permission before transfer of any land of which it is the lessor and the proviso expressly states that any transfer without permission will not be valid, binding or effective. We have also noticed from perusal of the record that it is an admitted fact that the plaintiff was dispossessed of the property and it is also true that there are discrepancies and inconsistency in his statement regarding the date of dispossession. While examining the materials on record before us, we have also perused the report of the Advocate Commissioner dated 28.03.2011 which is annexed and marked as Annexure-‘CC’ in the reply of the respondents to the counter affidavit filed by the Plaintiff Appellants. It is revealed from Annexure –‘CC’ that the Advocate Commissioner in his report made an observation that at the time of inspection the construction work on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor of the building was found  to be approximately one year and 2/3 months old building. From this report it may be assumed that the construction work had started around 2009 approximately and also helps to ascertain the fact that the plaintiff was actually not in possession since 2008.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate for the appellant had drawn our attention to Section 48 of Transfer of Property Act wherein he had argued that in accordance with the principles of Section 48 of Transfer of Property Act, the plaintiff’s title deed being earlier in time shall prevail over the defendant No.1ˈs title deed. Regarding this submission of the appellant, our considered view is that the legality or validity of either deed has not been decided yet and those will be decided in the suit. We are here to decide whether the rejection of the application for temporary injunction was given correctly or not.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The Learned Advocate for the Respondents while elaborating upon assertions contended that the plaintiff- Appellant failed to show possession in the property and therefore could not prima facie make out any case in favour of the plaintiff’s prayer for temporary injunction. In support of his submissions he cited a few  decisions before us, including that of our Apex Court in the case of Babul Chandra Biswas and others versus Dina Bandhu Chowdhury and others where the underlying principle propounded by Their Lordship’s was that fact of possession must be proved before granting temporary injunction. </li><li style="text-align:justify">Upon considering of the facts and circumstances and all the materials on record placed before us and also relying upon the decisions cited before us, it is an admitted fact that the plaintiff is not in possession of the property and it is also admitted that permission to transfer property was not obtained by the power of attorney holder while selling the suit land on behalf of the legal heirs of the original lessee and it also appears from the records that the construction upon the suit land has sufficiently progressed. Therefore we are constrained to hold that the defendant-respondents being in possession of the property and having obtaining prior permission before purchasing the suit land and construction already started and having made sufficient progress, the case is not prima-facie case in his favour and the plaintiff having failed to show possession and prima facie title in the suit property, the balance of convenience lies in favour of the defendant.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Under the foregoing facts and circumstances we are of the considered view that the Trial Court correctly passed Order No. 06 dated 04.05.2010 in Other Class Suit No. 33/2010 rejecting the application for temporary injunction filed by the defendant-appellant. Therefore we find no substance in the appeal and accordingly the appeal is dismissed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the result, the appeal is dismissed and the connected Rule being Civil Rule No. 324(FM)/10 is hereby discharged without any order as to costs.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The status-quo order granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         Communicate the order at once along with a copy of this judgment to the Court below immediately for information and necessary action.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

Obtaining the amount as ‘consultancy fee’ for awarding work order was not permitted under any law or Rules of the country and thus, itself was an offence as it was the upshot of criminal activities intending to achieve illegal monetary gains for which both accused Rahman and convict </strong><strong>Mamun were responsible.

He admitted</strong><strong> during his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that he received US $7,50,000 (taka five crore) as consultancy fee from Khadija Islam (PW-6). He earned the said money by doing business in abroad. Convict Mamun did not explain the deposit of rest amount of Taka more than 15(fifteen) Crore and why Moazzam Hossain, Mayer Chire and Marina Jaman deposited a huge amount of money in his account. It was convict Mamun’s obligation to explain the source and means of obtaining the said amount in view of the provision of section 106 of the Evidence Act.            . . . (118)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Money Laundering Protirodh Ain (VII of 2002)</strong><br/><strong>Section </strong><strong>2(V)</strong><strong>[</strong><strong>2(Tha)]</strong><br/><strong>From a plain reading of section </strong><strong>2(V</strong><strong>)[2(Tha)] of the Ain of 2002 it is crystal clear that to construe an offence of Money Laundering under the said Ain it is not necessary to prove that money in question is to be transferred from Bangladesh to any other country or to be brought it to Bangladesh from other countries illegally. Rather, acquision of wealth by illegal means, directly </strong><strong>or indirectly, and illegal transfer, conversion,</strong> <strong>concealment of acquired wealth, either legally</strong><strong> or illegally and aiding in accomplishing any of those acts may be considered as Money Laundering as defined in the Ain. . . . (130)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Money Laundering Protirodh Ain (VII of 2002)</strong><br/><strong>Section </strong><strong>২(ঠ)(অ)(আ)</strong><strong> [2(Tha)(A)(Aa)]</strong><br/><strong>The finding of the Learned trial Judge are absolutely based on surmise and conjecture. The learned trial Judge himself made out defense case on behalf of the absconding accused Rahman and thereby committed serious error of law in acquitting accused Rahman. Moreover, the learned trial judge misread and misconstrued the definition of ‘Money Laundering’ as defined in section </strong><strong>২(ঠ)(অ)(আ)</strong><strong> [2(Tha)(A)(Aa)] of the Ain of 2002 and also failed to understand its scope and purport.  . . .(132)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Evidence Act (I of 1872)</strong><br/><strong>Section 106</strong><br/><strong>In view of the nature of the offense and allegation as brought against accused Rahman, burden is upon him to explain why the Photostat copy of his passport was submitted in obtaining supplementary Gold Visa Card in connection with the account of convict Mamun with City Bank in Singapore and why he spent huge amount of money in different countries for his personal visits, shopping and meeting medical expenses by using the said visa card. These facts are especially within the knowledge of accused Rahman and the burden cast on him to rebut the allegation made against him. Having regarded to the fact that accused Rahman knowingfully well about the trial absconded and avoided the trial willfully and thereby, failed to discharge his burden in view of the provision of section 106 of the Evidence Act. And thus, it can be validly inferred that he is guilty of offence of Money Laundering.                      . . .

Indisputably accused Rahman</strong><strong> used the bank account of convict Mamun in transacting ‘dirty money’ received through illegal means (</strong><strong>A‰ea cš’v</strong><strong>) which is an offence under the Ain of 2002. It is a financial corruption which affects and derogates states economy and it is increased.

By that amendment the informant officer of the Commission is legally empowered to hold investigation into the case. Thus, the submission of Mr. Ali that the investigation of the case by the informant officer of the commission is without lawful authority is baseless.   . . .

The object of the offender is aimed to use the proceeds of crime in the manner as if it has been earned legally.

It reveals from the record that as per order of the concerned Court the Government permitted accused Rahman to go abroad for treatment. The learned Metropolitan Special Judge after receiving the case record on 07.07.2010 for trial fixed next date on 10.08.2010 for hearing on cognizance matter. On 10.08.2010 the learned Advocate for the accused Rahman by filing an application sought adjournment for hearing on cognizance matter on the ground that he was in abroad for treatment and the learned Special Judge allowed the said prayer and fixed next date on 26.09.2010.

Ibrahim, the then Assistant Director, Durnity Daman (Anti-Corruption) Commission (herein after referred as commission), in short, is that he lodged a First Information Report (FIR) on 26.10.2009 with Cantonment Police Station under Sections 2 and 4(2) of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2009 implicating both the accused persons alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that various incidents of offences alleged to have been committed by the accused persons from 01.01.2003 to 31.05.2007; the accused persons in collusion with each other having earned directly by illegal manner an amount of Tk.20,41,25,843.00 deposited the same secretly in account No.158052 with City Bank NA, Singapore and thereby, committed the offence concealing the same; since January, 2003 convict Mamun had maintained the said Bank account No.158052, Maxi-Save Account No.0-158052-038 and City Access Account No.0-158052-016.

Despite, all the steps/efforts taken by this Court the Respondent No.1 did not surrender before the concerned Court and thereby he did not comply the Court’s order. As such, the court has reasoned to believe that the Respondent No.1 has absconded and concealed himself in order to avoid the hearing of the appeal.<br/>In the above facts and circumstances justice demands that the appeal should be heard in absence of the Respondent No.1, as the notice has been served upon him in accordance with law and the appeal is ready for hearing otherwise.<br/>Let the instant appeal along with the connecting Criminal Appeal No.7469 of 2013 be fixed for being on 4<sup>th</sup> May, 2016 at 2.00 P.M.”</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Accordingly, both the appeals were listed on 04.05.2016 for hearing.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Md. Khurshid Alam Khan, the learned Advocate appearing for the Commission has submitted that in convicting Mamun the learned trial Judge assessed, evaluated and appreciated the evidence, both oral and documentary, properly and rightly and thus, found guilty to convict Mamun; but the learned Judge having misread and misconstrued the evidence and materials on record adduced by the prosecution as well as the definition of ‘Money Laundering’ as defined in section 2(Tha) of the Ain of 2002 most illegally acquitted accused Rahman though the prosecution proved the charge brought against him beyond reasonable doubt.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Khan referring to the observations made by the learned trial Judge has further submitted that the learned Judge most illegally himself made out defense case on behalf of absconding accused Rahman and acquitted him and as such the judgment of acquittal of accused Rahman is prima face bad in law and liable to be set aside. Mr. Khan referring to the evidence of PW-2 Devra La Prevottee, Supervisory Special Agent for FBI, US has also submitted that said witness having proved Bank documents relating to the account of convict Mamun with City Bank, Singapore, material exhibit-I series and II series, categorically testified that she had tracked down the money laundered by the accused Rhaman to a Bank account in Singapore. Her evidence as well as the evidence of other prosecution witnesses were neither controverted nor assailed by the accused Rahman and thus, the learned trial Judge acted illegally in acquitting him.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. A.J. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate appearing for convict Mamun referring to the evidence of PW-12 the investigating officer has submitted that the investigation was done in a perfunctory manner and he seized the alleged documents in not complying with the mandatory provision of law. He has further submitted that the present case had been inquired and investigated by same person and under Rule 24 of the Anti-Corruption Commission Rules, 2007 the same person has no authority to inquire and investigate the case and as such the investigation of the present case is without lawfull authority and it has vitiated the whole investigation process as well as the trial.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali has also submitted that PW-2 Devra La Prevottee was not cited as a witness in the charge sheet. All of a sudden she produced before the trial Court and her statements was not supplied to the accused as per section 6(7) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 and as such her evidence should be left out of consideration and the learned Special Judge erred in law in considering her evidence in finding the guilt of convict Mamun.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is submitted by Mr. Ali that PW-6, Khadija Islam, in her deposition categorically stated that the alleged money was given to convict Mamun as his remuneration for his work done as consultancy. The prosecution neither declared this witness hostile nor proved that the money earned by convict Mamun as consultancy fee is illegal and as such there is no scope to say that convict Mamun earned US$7,50,000 illegally. Moreover, prosecution has failed to bring an iota of evidence with regard to the excess amount than US$7,50,000. As such, the findings of the learned trial Judge that convict Mamun in total laundered Taka 20 (Twenty) crore is absolutely based on mere surmise and conjecture.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali has also submitted that the offence of money laundering is attracted when the said money is sent illegally from Bangladesh to any other country or it came into Bangladesh from the foreign country, but in the instant case the money was deposited and transferred from one Singapore account to another Singapore account, thereby it shall not be attracted the Money Laundering offence under the Ain of 2002.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali has further submitted that after the parliament election held in 29<sup>th</sup> December,2008 the parliament in its first sessions enacted total 32 Ordinances (though the approval committee has approved 54 Ordinances) out of 122 Ordinances which were promulgated during Care Taker Government. 68 Ordinances were not placed before the Parliament including Ordinance No.XVII of 2007 dated 30.07.2007 by which section 3(ka) of the Money Laundering Act, 2002 was inserted and the Ordinacne No. VII of 2007 dated 30.07.2007 by which ‘Money Laundering’ as an offence included in the schedule of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. Therefore, aforesaid Acts shall be read without considering of the aforesaid amendment. Hence, the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 or the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2002 did not authorize the Anti-Corruption Commission to lodge or investigate any offence committed under the Ain of 2002.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali has also submitted that charge was framed for alleged laundering of US$ 7,50,000 and not a single prosecution witness uttered any single word regarding excess amount than US$ 7,50,000; therefore, for the sake of argument even if the prosecution was able to prove it’s charge of money laundering of US$ 7,50,000 (that is equivalent to 5 crore) however, learned trial judge imposed fine of Taka 40 crore upon the convict Mamun and as such imposition fine is not only unjust and also illegal.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ali has finally submitted that without prejudice to the submission made above, even though the accused committed the alleged offence, it will not come within mischief of Ain of 2002; at best section 163 of the Penal Code may attract the alleged offence, which is not punishable under the Ain of 2002.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Mahbubey Alam, the learned Attorney General, appearing for the respondent-State, on the other hand, having supported the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed against convict Mamun and adopting the submissions of Mr. Khan, the learned Advocate for the commission, has submitted that admittedly convict Mamun took US$ 7,50,000 as consultancy fee from PW-6,Khadiza Islam, local agent of M/s Harbin Power Engineering Company of China, for awarding work order in favour of the said company; but obtaining such money in the name of consultancy fee was not permitted under any law or rules of the country and as such, convict Mamun acquired said money by illegal means and thereby committed offence of Money Laundering as defined section <strong>2(W)</strong> of the Ain of 2002 and accused Rahman aided convict Mamun to commit the said offence. He has further submitted that offence of Money Laundering is one of the serious financial crimes, and in a case of financial crime if the fact that the accused has acquired property, movable or immovable, by illegal means is proved, the court shall presume, unless the accused succeeds to rebut such presumption in court, that he is guilty of said offence and a conviction therefore shall not be invalid by reason only it is based on such presumption. In the instant case, convict Mamun failed to rebut the presumption of the court that the money in question was acquired by illegal means. Thus, the appeal filed by convict Mamun is liable to be dismissed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the instant case Mohammad Ibrahim, the informant, at first examined as PW-1. As PW-1 he reiterated the prosecution case, proved exhibit-1, the memo of approval by the commission for inquiring the case, First Information Report, exhibit-2, his signature on it as exhibit 2/1, 2/2 respectively.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In cross-examination he stated that at the time of lodging the FIR he was the Assistant Director of the Commission and he had investigated the case under the provision of Money Laundering Ain, 2009 and prior to that the Ain of 2002 was in force. The alleged bank transaction was made in the account of convict Mamun in Singapore; he went Singapore and consulted with the bank record. Khadiza Islam deposited US $7,50,000 in the account of convict Mamun maintained in Singapore. Khadiza Islam paid the said money to convict Mamun as bribe. He had no knowledge whether separate case was lodged for taking the above bribe. He consulted the documents and from the report of FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) it was evident that between the accused persons there was collusion. Convict Mamun returned back Tk 20,41,25,843/- from his Singapore account to his account in Bangladesh. There is no document that convict Mamun sent the said money in abroad. Khadiza Islam gave bribe US $7,50,000 to convict Mamun. Khadiza Islam being the local agent of Harbin Engineering Company, a Chinese Company was compelled to give the said money as bribe in order to get the work order in favour of the said Company who was the lowest bidder for installing an 80 MW capacity power station in Tongi. He did not find out the source of the said money and where from Khadija Islam got it. Convict Mamun being the closest associate of accused Rahman, son of the then Prime Minister, compelled various persons to give them bribe in order to get the various work orders. No money was transferred outside the Bangladesh but all the money were received in order to facilitate business gain and awarding work orders. He denied the defense suggestion that he lodged the First Information Report due to political influence.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-2 Debra La Prevotte, an F.B.I. agent testified that in 2008 the then Ad-Interim Government of Bangladesh requested the assistance of the United States pursuant to a Mutual legal Assistance Request and because of that request the United States sent representative of the United States to Dhaka to obtain information regarding bribery cases. The United State reviewed the request to ensure that it was not politically motivated. There after holding meeting with the Commission she started investigation with the permission of the U.S. Government. As part of her investigation she discovered several Bank accounts in Singapore. Among those accounts she discovered a Bank account in City Bank NA, Singapore in the name of convict Mamun. The U.S. Department of Justice via Mutual legal Assistance requested Singapore Government to obtain documents of those City Bank accounts. Accordingly, the City Bank authority of Singapore sent documents of convict Mamun’s City Bank A/C nos.158052-016-008 and another one is 158052-016. She reviewed those Bank records and found that 02(two) credit cards were issued by the City Bank, Singapore in connection with the accounts of convict Mamun. The first credit card in this account is a visa card no.45688177000064124 in the name of convict Mamun and there were also another Visa Card no.4568817010064122 in the name of accused Rahman. In this regard she submitted 43 pages of documents, material exhibit-I series. US Government obtained the City Bank records in Singapore of 2004 &amp; 2005 and the Government of Bangladesh also made a request to the Government of Singapore via Mutual legal Assistance for bank record from City Bank for many accounts including those of convict Mamun. In December, 2009 she compared the records of City Bank received from Singapore by Bangladesh Government. And on 15<sup>th</sup> December, 2009 she certified that both copies were identical. She signed a letter of certification stating that those documents were the same. She proved the documents comprising 229 pages as Material exhibit-II (series) and her signatures as material exhibit-II/A &amp; A/1 respectively. Those documents were sent from the Department of Justice to the Embassy of Bangladesh Washington D.C. with Stamped properly of the Embassy Seal. The Embassy of Bangladesh in Washington D.C. sent those records to the office of the Attorney General of Bangladesh. Bangladesh also requested City Bank NA Bangladesh to turn over documents relating to convict Mamun’s account of 2003 to 2006. In material exhibit-I (series) pages-3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 relates to the authenticity of the bank records given by Bangladesh Embassy, Singapore &amp; Foreign Ministry Bangladesh and also Agens Sng Hwee Lee, the Asst. Director Singapore Academy of Law certified the Notary’s Signature. The Notary’s name in page-4 (who certified) was Soh Kheng Yeow Augustine. She had reviewed all those bank records as a part of her investigation. She found Photostat copy of accused Rahman’s passport was submitted to City Bank Singapore to obtain the second Visa Card of convict Mamun’s City Bank account. The Photostat copy of accused Rahman’s passport was in the pages-40, 42 &amp; 43 of Material exhibit-I (series). There were also Photostat copies of convict Mamun’s passport found in page No.29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 &amp; 38 of the material Exbt-I (series); the number of accused Rahman’s passport was Y 0085483 where his father’s name was found late President Ziaur Rahman, Bir Uttam and mother was as Begum Khaleda Zia. Page-39 of those documents was a copy of supplemental Card request to add a Visa Credit Card for accused Rahman. Convict Mamun’s passport number was Q 0998382. She also reviewed the bank records from 2003 to 2006 of the Credit Card Statements. Those statements reflected charges made total 50613.97 US Dollars of accused Rahman’s Credit Card. She also reviewed accused Manun’s City Bank statements and found that accused Rahman’s and Mamun’s both charge were paid from the account of convict Mamun. Accused Rahman’s Credit Card showed that he used his Credit Card to pay his travel expenses to visit Athens Greece, Frankfurt Germany, Singapore, Bangkok &amp; Dubai along with shopping and meet medical expenditures. The documents provided by the Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh indicated that a Bangladeshi business woman Khadija Islam transferred 7,50,000 U.S Dollars to convict Mamun’s City Bank account in Singapore and it was found transferred on 01.08.2003. Convict Mamun’s account with City Bank Singapore was used to make payment of accused Rahman’s Visa Credit Card.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The learned Advocate for the convict Mamun was reluctant to cross examine the said witness, even convict Mamun who was present in the dock also refused to cross examine personally when asked by the learned trial Judge in the open court.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-3 Hosne Ara Begum deposed that on 26.10.2009 while she was serving as the officer in charge of Cantonment Police Station she having received a complaint through Md. Ibrahim, Assistant Director of the Commission registered Cantonment Police Station Case No.8(10)09 against convict Mamun and Rahman under section 2, 4(2) of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2009. She filled up the FIR form. She proved the First Informant Report exhibt-2, her signature on it exhibit-2/3, FIR form exhibit-3, her two signatures on it exhibit-3/1 and 3/2 respectively.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In cross-examination she stated that Md. Ibrahim, Assistant Director of the Commission, Head Office presented the First Information Report before her. She denied the defense suggestion that she recorded the First Information Report mechanically.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-4 Mir Alimuzzaman deposed that in the year 2007 while he was serving as the Police Inspector of Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, he investigated Gulshan Police Station Case No.38 dated 09.05.2007 under section 386/387 of the Penal Code read with Emergency Powers Rules and in course of the investigation of the said case he came to know that Khadija Islam, Chairman of Nirman Construction, lodged the said case alleging that Nirman Construction Company became the lowest bidder for installing an 80 M.W capacity Power Station at BISIC industrial area in Tongi. Despite no work order was issued by the authority in favour of their company. And then, convict Mamun through telephone told Khadija Islam to the effect that if they want to get the work order in that case they had to pay Tk 05(five) Crore.

There are two key elements to a money laundering offence:</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The necessary act of laundering itself i.e. the provision of financial services; and</li><li style="text-align:justify">A requisite degree of knowledge or suspicion (either subjective or objective) relating to the source of the funds or the conduct of a client.</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The act of laundering is committed in circumstances where a person is engaged in an arrangement (i.e. by providing a service or product) and that arrangement involves the proceeds of crime. These arrangements include a wide variety of business relationships e.g. banking, fiduciary and investment management.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The requisite degree of knowledge or suspicion will depend upon the specific offence but will usually be present where the person providing the arrangement, service or product knows suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that the property involved in the arrangement represents the proceeds of crime. In some cases the offence may also be committed where a person knows or suspects that the person with whom he or she is dealing is engaged in or has benefited from criminal conduct.</li><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Why is money laundering illegal?</strong></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         The objective of the criminalization of money laundering is to take the profit out of crime. The rationale for the creation of the offence is that it is wrong for individuals and organizations to assist criminals to benefit from the proceeds of their criminal activity or to facilitate the commission of such crimes by providing financial services to them.<br/><strong>[source: https://www.int-comp.org]</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>How is money laundered?</strong></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         Traditionally money laundering has been described as a process which takes place in there distant stages:</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><li style="text-align:justify">Placement</li><li style="text-align:justify">Layering</li><li style="text-align:justify">Integration</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Placement</strong><br/>         At this stage, illegal funds or assets are first brought into the financial system. This placement makes the funds more liquid. For example, if cash is converted into a bank deposit, it becomes easier to transfer and manipulate. Money launderers place illegal funds using a variety of techniques, which include depositing cash into bank accounts and using cash to purchase assets.<br/><strong>         Layering</strong><br/>         To conceal the illegal origin of the placed funds and thereby make them more useful, the funds must be moved, dispersed and disguised. The process of distancing the placed funds from their illegal origins is known as layering. At this stage, money launderers use many different techniques to layer the funds. These include using multiple banks and accounts. Having professionals act as intermediaries and transacting through corporations and trusts. Funds may be shuttled through a web of many accounts, companies and countries in order to disguise their origins.<br/><strong>         Integration</strong><br/>         Once the funds are layered and distanced from their origins, they are made available to criminals to use and control as apparently legitimate funds. This final stage in the money laundering process is called integration. <u>The laundered funds are made available for activities such as investment in legitimate or illegitimate businesses, or spent to promote the criminal’s lifestyle</u>.

Convict Mamun and his learned lawyer refrained to cross-examine PW-2. Rather, convict Mamun during his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure admitted that he had maintained a Bank account being No.158052 with city Bank, Singapore and Khadija Islam (PW-6) transferred US $7,50,000 to his said account from her account with OCBC Bank, Singapore as consultancy fee for awarding the work order in favour of M/s Harbin Power Engineering Company, a Chinese firm for installing 80 MW capacity power plant at Tongi Industrial area. He further stated that the money deposited in his said account was the profit of his business done in abroad and those were legal income.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is true that PW-2 was not cited in the charge sheet as a witness. But record shows that on 15.11.2011 after completion of examination of P.W-1 on behalf of the prosecution an application under section 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was filled before the trial court to record testimony of Debra Laprevottee, a Special Agent of FBI as a witness stating inter-alia that she was now staying in Bangladesh and as a member of Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, USA, under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) for asset recovery she had assisted the Commission during investigation of this case and accordingly tracked the money in question alleged to have been laundered by the accused persons. As such, she was a competent person and she might be called as a witness under section 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Defense raised objection verbally against the said application saying that it was unconventional to call an unscheduled witnesses before completing witnesses mentioned in the charged-sheet.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The trial Court after hearing the respective parties by the order of the same date allowed the said application and thereby permitted the prosecution to testify Debra Laprevotte of FBI before the Court and accordingly notice was issued upon her. And eventually, on 16.11.2011 Debra Laprevottee was testified before the Court. It is pertinent to mention here that on behalf of convict Mamun it was informed to the Court that they would move before the Higher Court against the said order allowing the application under section 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed by the prosecution but there is nothing on the record that they had challenged the said order before the Higher Court. Even, convict Mamun did not avail the opportunity to rebut the statement of PW-2 by cross-examining her. Thus, there is hardly any scope to say that the defense was prejudiced in any way in examining PW-2.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is now well settled that the trial Court has unfettered power under section 540 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to call any person to be examined as witness at any stage of trial or inquiry, if it appears essential for just decision of the case before it, no matter whether his statement was recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or not.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the case of Hemayetuddin alias Aurango Vs. State, reported in 46 DLR 186(AD), it has been held that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Section 540 Criminal Procedure is expressed in the widest possible term and it cannot be said that the intention of the section is to limit its application to court witness only. The power is available to the Court, “if his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case”.”</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Thus, the submission of the learned Advocate for convict Mamun that the evidence of PW-2, not being a charge sheeted witness, should be left out of consideration is absolutely misconceived and not tenable in law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-4 Mir Alimuzzaman deposed that in the year 2007 while he was serving as the Police Inspector of Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, he investigated Gulshan Police Station Case No.38 dated 09.05.2007 under section 386/387 of the Penal Code read with Emergency Power Rules and in course of the investigation of the said case he came to know that Khadiza Islam, Chairman of Nirman construction, lodged the said case alleging that Nirman Construction Company became the lowest bidder for installing an 80 M.W capacity Power Station at BISIC Industrial area at Tongi, despite no work order was issued by the authority in favour of their company. And then, convict Mamun through telephone informed Khadiza Islam to the effect that if they wanted to get the work order in that case they had to pay Tk 05(five) crore. Convict Mamun also asked Khadiza Islam to deposit the said money in her bank account operated in Singapore and Khadiza Islam having opened a bank account in OCBC Bank, Singapore transferred US $7,50,000 to the account of convict Mamun and convict Mamun and accused Rahman through Credit Cards spent a huge amount of money from the said account. Convict Mamun made confessional statement under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the said case. Eventually, convict Mamun expressed his desire to return back the entire money from the said account to Bangladesh. Having obtained necessary order from the concerned court convict Mamun opened a Bank account in Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch and the said money was transferred from Singapore to his said Bank account. Since the offence was Money Laundering which is a schedule offence of Anti-Corruption Commission Act,2004 he submitted a report to the Chairman, Anti-Corruption Commission for necessary action. He proved the said report as exhibit-4 and his signature on it as exhibit-4/1.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-6 Khadiza Islam, Chairman Nirman International deposed that her company used to work civil and electrical sectors. In the year 2002 a tender was invited for installing an 80 M.W. capacity Power Station at Tongi industrial area. Their company being the local agent of M/S Harbin Power Engineering, a Chinese company, participated in the said tender and became the lowest bidder. PDB (Power Development Board) recommended to the concerned Ministry to issue the work order in favour of the Harbin Company. However, no decision was given on it by the concerned Ministry though 08(eight) months elapsed. In that situation they made contact with the authority of PDB, and they asked them to contact with the Ministry. The authority of Harbin Company became annoyed because of such long delay and it expressed desire to take back its bid. They had also tried to make contact with Mr. Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku, the Minister of the concerned Ministry, but failed. However, Mr. Sammi, the private secretary to the minister, asked them to make contact with convict Mamun as he had good relationship with the Minister. She knew convict Mamun as they were from same locality. She made contact with convict Mamun and informed him all the matters. In initial stage convict Mamun was reluctant but ultimately he talked with the concerned persons of the Chinese Company and agreed to assist them in order to awarding the work order. After two weeks of such agreement the matter was placed before the concerned committee for its approval and the concerned committee approved the same and accordingly in the year 2003 agreement was signed between M/s Harbin Power Engineering and PDB (Power Development Board). After signing of the said agreement convict Mamun asked her to pay consultancy fee as the same was agreed by the Harbin Company for assisting it to get the work order and he also asked to make the said payment in his Bank account in Singapore to avoid further delay and complication. As per the advice of the Chinese company she having went to Singapore opened a Bank account in OCBC Bank and China Harbin company transferred US $7.50.000 from China to her Bank account and thereafter, she transferred the said money to the account of convict Mamun.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-8 Syed Ahsanul Hafiz deposed that on 31.07.2007 while he was serving as Executive officer Sonali Bank, Cantonment Corporate Branch, he issued a Payment order with regard to Tk. 20,41,25,613.28 in favour of the Bangladesh Government. He proved the Photostat copy of the said payment order as exhibit-7.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-9 Md. Nazrul Islam deposed that in year 2007 he was serving as the Deputy General Manager of Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch. On 11.06.2007 convict Mamun came to their bank and he opened a savings account being No.34450546 and 03(three) foreign drafts being No.241096763 dated 08.05.2007 amounting to €1,28609.88, draft No.281096762 dated 08.05.2007 amounting to £14059.89  and draft No. 262501698 dated 07.05.2007 amounting to US $27,77,351 were deposited for collection. Accordingly, after collection in accordance with law Tk. 20,41,25,843.27 was deposited in the said account of convict Mamun and eventually, said money was transferred to Bangladesh Bank through a payment order (exhibit-7). He proved the attested copies of said documents as exhibit-8 series.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-10 Bivhuti Bhushan Sarker, a Bank Officer, proved exhibit-7&amp;8 series and deposed that he attested the said documents of the Bank comparing the original of those. He proved his signatures on exhibit-7&amp;8 series.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-12 Sayed Tahsinul Haque, an officer of the Commission, deposed that he seized the relevant documents regarding the Bank account of convict Mamun maintained in Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch in connection with Cantonment Police Station Case No.2 dated 02.05.2007 and he proved the seizure list exhibit-11.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-13 Md. Ibrahim Proved exhibit-12, the Bank documents relating to the account of convict Mamun with City Bank, Singapore. He further deposed that Ms. Khadija Islam was the local agent of M/s Harbin Power Engineering, a Chinese company. Convict Mamun and his business partner accused Rahman demanded money in order to provide the work order in favour of the said company and accordingly she transferred US $7,50,000 to the Mamun’s account being No.158052 with the City Bank, Singapore from her account being No.650-810-0721 maintained in OCBC Bank, Singapore. From the said account convict Mamun through City Bank international Visa Card being No. 4568-8170-0006-4124 and accused Rahman through supplementary Gold Visa Card being No.4568-8170-1006-4122 spent US $79,542 and US $54,982 respectively knowing fully well that the money was illegally earned. Moazzam Hossain, Mayer Chire and Marina Jaman also transferred US $11,67,000, US $4,20,000 and US $30,000 respectively to the said account of convict Mamun. Eventually, convict Mamun transferred in total US $27,78,982 amounting to Taka 20,41,25,843 from his City Bank Singapore account No.158052 to the account being No.34450546 with Sonali Bank, Cantonment Corporate Branch, Dhaka.</li><li style="text-align:justify">On careful scrutiny and examination of the above evidence, it is crystal clear that the prosecution witnesses corroborated each other on material points particularly that convict Mamun compelled Khadija Islam (PW-6) to deposit US$ 7,50,000 in his Bank account with City Bank, Singapore. Besides PW-6, some other persons namely Moazzam Hossain, Mayer Chire and Marina Jaman also deposited money in the said account and eventually, at the instance of convict Mamun in total Taka 20,44,25,843 was transferred in his account with Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch, Dhaka from the account maintained in Singapore. And thereafter, a payment order (exhibit-7) was issued regarding the said amount infavour of Bangladesh Bank. The entire money was earned by illegal means.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is further evident from the evidence of D.W-1 Ahmed Azam Khan, the Tax Consultant of convict Mamun who had been submitting his tax return for last 20(twenty) years, that in the said returns convict Mamun at no point of time disclosed about the account maintained with City Bank, Singapore and the money deposited therein. DW-1 also testified that he had no knowledge about the account maintained by convict Mamun in Singapore. As per Article 75 and 80 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 and Rule 25 of the Income Tax Rules, 1984 convict Mamun was under obligation to disclose about his said account and money in his tax return. This fact also proves that convict Mamun with malafide intention concealed the said facts and thereby, disguised about the said illegally earned money which is ‘dirty money’ or ‘corrupt money’.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In the instant case accused Rahman and his friend convict Mamun were prosecuted and tried under the Ain of 2002 and the trial Court convicted only Mamun while it acquitted Rahman. Allegation, as transpires, is that on demand of convict Mamun, Khadija Islam deposited 7,50,000 US Dollar from her account No.650-410-0721 with OCBC Bank, Singapore to the account of convict Mamun with the City Bank in Singapore. Convict Mamun also admitted the said fact during examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Convict Mamun Knowingly received the said ‘dirty money’/’corrupt money’ in the name of ‘consultancy fee’ with the assurance that a work order would be awarded to her company for constructing an 80 (eighty) MW capacity power station in Tongi BISIC Industrial Area.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It has been unfolded from bank records, material exhibit-I and II and exhibit-12, which were duly proved by PW-2 and PW-13, that accused Rahman used to maintain a supplementary Gold Visa Card being No.4568-8170-1006-4122 and it was intended to hide the source of money by spending the same which constituted the offence of money laundering punishable under the Ain of 2002. Accused Rahman in collaboration with convict Mamun by using the said visa card had drawn and spent 54,942 US Dollar.</li><li style="text-align:justify">We have already noticed that Money laundering is a single process. However, its cycle can be broken down into three distinct stages namely, placement stage, layering stage and integration stage. At the placement stage of deriving the amount [alleged consultation fee] accused Rahman got him engaged through convict Mamun who inserted the ‘dirty money’ in his account into a legitimate financial institution in Singapore in the form of cash deposits, it may be validly inferred. Next, at the layering stage too accused Rahman’s involvement stands proved as he is found to have had drawn 54,981.42 US Dollar by using the supplementary Gold Visa card being No. 4568-8170-1006-4122 and it was done intending to keep the fund distant from their source. And even at integration stage accused Rahman used the money without getting caught, by using the Supplementary Gold Visa card which was well within the knowledge of convict Mamun. Moreover, convict Mamun at the time of examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had explained so many facts but he was silent about such withdrawing money from his account using supplementary Gold Visa card by accused Rahman.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Further, convict Mamun admitted during examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that he received US $7,50,000 as consultancy fee from Khadija Islam (PW-6) intending to favour her company in getting work order. The amount was deposited in convict Mamun’s account with City Bank, Singapore and thus, offence of money laundering was committed by convict Mamun.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Mr. Mohammad Ali, the learned Advocate for the convict Mamun has tried to convince us that taking such consultancy fee is not illegal and no money was transferred from Bangladesh to the account of Convict Mamun with City Bank, Singapore and as such no offence of Money Laundering was committed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Was the alleged consultancy fee acquired by any lawful means? And whether the amount so obtained was transferred to convict Mamun’s bank account in Singapore in lawful way? Did convict Mamun and his close friend and associate accused Rahman disguise the entire activities? All these questions are essentially involved in resolving the matter of violation of Section <strong>2(</strong><strong>ঠ)(অ)(আ</strong><strong>)</strong> [2(Tha) (A) (Aa)] of the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2002.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The offence of ‘<strong>Money Laundering’</strong> has been defined in the Ain of 2002 as below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>২z(ঠ) মানিলন্ডারিং অর্থ-</strong><br/><strong>(অ)অবৈধ প¿Ûায় প্রত্যক্ষ বা পরোক্ষভাবে আহরিত বা অর্জিত সম্পদ;</strong><br/><strong>(আ) বৈধ বা অবৈধ প¿Ûায় প্রত্যক্ষ বা পরোক্ষভাবে আহরিত বা অর্জিত সম্পদের অবৈধ প¿Ûায় হস¹া¿¹র, রুপা¿¹র, অবসÛানের গোপনকরণ বা উক্ত কাজে সহায়তা করা;</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">In view of the above definition acquiring wealth illegally, directly or indirectly, and any illegal transfer, conversion, concealment of acquired wealth, either legally or illegally, and assisting in accomplishing any of those acts will come within the mischief of ‘Money Laundering’. The above definition of Money Laundering is very wide.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Further, the word <strong>""অবৈধ প¿Ûা''</strong> (illegal means) has also been defined in section <strong>2(L)</strong> <strong>[2(Ka)]</strong> of the said Ain, which is as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong><strong>অবৈধ প¿Ûা অর্থ কোন আইন, বিধি বা প্রবিধান দ্বারা স্বীকৃত নহে এমন কোন প¿Ûা</strong><strong>”</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Thus, ‘Unauthorized means’ any means not recognized as legal by any law, regulation or rule.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is found proved that accused Rahman withdrew a huge amount by using his supplementary Gold Visa card from the account in question. It remained unexplained why convict Mamun permitted his friend accused Rahman to get the supplementary Gold Visa card against his [Mamun] bank account operated in Singapore. It rather proved collective criminality.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The facts unveiled from the cumulative evaluation of evidence tendered tend to prove that accused Rahman was aware about receiving the said ‘consultancy fee’ from Khadija Islam (PW-6). Accused Rahman was a mighty man having profile of being the son of the then Prime Minister Begum Khalida Zia. Convict Mamun was his close companion which also admitted by D.W-2.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Further, it transpires from material exhibit-1, the bank documents relating to the account of convict Mamun with City Bank, Singapore that at time of opening the said account convict Mamun provided information in the opening form that he was a Director of Rahman Group of Industries (paper book, 2<sup>nd</sup> part, page-498) and his address was mentioned in the said form and in the statement of account as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Md. Gias Uddin Al-Mamun,<br/>C/o. Rahman Group of Industries,<br/>House No.16, Road No.19A, Banani,<br/>Dhaka-1212, Bangladesh.”<br/>(Paper book, 2<sup>nd</sup> part, page-733-792)</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The above address is the address of accused Rahman’s business firm, as it transpires from the charge sheet.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Thus, the relationship of both convict Mamun and accused Rahman are well proved and obtaining the amount of US $7,50,000 as ‘consultancy fee’ obviously took place within the knowledge of accused Rahman.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Convict Mamun’s alleged consultancy for providing/awarding the work order to M/s Harbin Power Engineering Company, Chinese Company, for installing an 80 MW capacity power station influencing and interfering the concerned Ministry was nothing but an illegal, unauthorized and unwarranted act. Concerned Ministry that is the Government was supposed to take decision on the recommendation of Power Development Board (PDB) regarding the tender in their own way. A private person or a businessman like convict Mamun or accused Rahman is not permitted or allowed under any existing law, regulation or rules of the country to do such an act in the name of consultancy. Convict Mamun being a private person and an ordinary businessman, as claimed by the DWs, had no authority to interfere with the internal affairs and works of the Ministry that is the Republic. The Ministry kept itself silent on the matter refraining from giving any decision on the recommendation of PDB regarding the work order for about 08(eight) months and it became active and awarded the work order within 02 (two weeks) when convict Mamun had come into scene in the name of consultancy. Thus, it can be validly presumed that convict Mamun made it possible as he was the close friend and business partner of accused Rahman and obviously, Mamun’s source of such ‘supernatural power’ was accused Rahman, son of the then Prime Minister. Convict Mamun’s such act of consultancy as claimed by him was a ‘supernatural work (<strong>অলৌকিক</strong>)’ and the money acquired in the name of such consultancy is nothing but ‘dirty money’.</li><li style="text-align:justify"><u>Obtaining the amount as ‘consultancy fee’ for awarding work order was not permitted under any law or Rules of the country and thus, itself was an offence as it was the upshot of criminal activities intending to achieve illegal monetary gains for which both accused Rahman and convict Mamun were responsible</u>.</li><li style="text-align:justify"><u>Obviously political position and might made them imbued to receive the said amount in the name of consultancy fee. Accused Rahman and convict Mamun jointly designed to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the fund kept deposited in Mamun’s account in Singapore. </u>(Underlines supplied to give emphasis)</li><li style="text-align:justify">It appears that the amount equivalent to more than Taka 20 Crore was found deposited in the account of Convict Mamun. He admitted during his examination under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that he received US $7,50,000 (take five crore) as consultancy fee from Khadija Islam (PW-6). He earned the said money by doing business in abroad. Convict Mamun did not explain the deposit of rest amount of Taka more than 15(fifteen) Crore and why Moazzam Hossain, Mayer Chire and Marina Jaman deposited a huge amount of money in his account. It was convict Mamun’s obligation to explain the source and means of obtaining the said amount in view of the provision of section 106 of the Evidence Act.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Section 106 of the Evidence Act deals with the burden of proving a fact especially within the knowledge of any person.

But the Section would apply to cases where the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, failed to offer any explanation which drive the court to draw a different inference.”<br/>And<br/><u>“The pristine rule that the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused should not be taken as a fossilized doctrine as though it admits no process of intelligent reasoning. The doctrine of presumption is not alien to the above rule, nor would it impair the temper of the rule. On the other hand, if the traditional rule relating to burden of proof of the prosecution is allowed to be wrapped in pedantic coverage the offenders in serious offences would be the major beneficiaries, and the society would be the casualty.</u>” (Underlines supplied)</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">In view of the above proposition in absence of any explanation or indication whatsoever it may be validly inferred that the entire amount of Taka 20,41,25,843 was obtained not from any lawful source and that money derived from several crimes and thus, the said money was ‘dirty money’ or ‘corrupt money’ which was kept deposited in the bank account in question in Singapore, disguising the source and location.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In absence of anything contrary, the facts and circumstances as unveiled impel to conclude that the amount found deposited in Mamun’s account including the amount of US $7,50,000 obtained through criminal act which was laundered to Mamun’s bank account in Singapore as there has been nothing to show any lawful source and means of the rest of the amount found deposited in his account. This inference leads us to conclude that the entire amount found deposited in convict Mamun’s account was obtained through criminal means and to hide the source of the same is an act of Money Laundering.</li><li style="text-align:justify">From a plain reading of section <strong>২(ঠ)</strong> [2(Tha)] of the Ain of 2002 it is crystal clear that to construe an offence of Money Laundering under the said Ain it is not necessary to prove that money in question is to be transferred from Bangladesh to any other country or to be brought it to Bangladesh from other countries illegally. Rather, acquision of wealth by illegal means, directly or indirectly, and illegal transfer, conversion, concealment of acquired wealth, either legally or illegally and aiding in accomplishing any of those acts may be considered as Money Laundering as defined in the Ain. Thus, the submission of Mr. Ali to the effect: ‘since no money was transferred from Bangladesh to the account of convict Mamun with City Bank Singapore and thus, no offence of Money Laundering was committed’ is absolutely misconceived and not tenable in law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In acquitting accused Rahman the learned trial Judge has observed that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>""আসামী তারেক রহমান যদি মামুনের মাধ্যমে অবৈধ অর্থ অর্জন করে সিংগাপুর মামুনের একাউন্টে জমা করতো তাহলে জমাকৃত সাড়ে বিশ কোটি টাকার সিংহভাগ আসামী তারেক কর্তৃক নিজ স্বার্থে উত্তোলন বা খরচ করতোz কি¿º আসামী তারেক রহমান মাত্র পয়ত্রিশ লক্ষ টাকা উত্তোলন করে খরচ করেছেz ফলে যুক্তিসংগত কারণে বিশ্বাস করা যায় না যে, আসামী তারেক রহমান আসামী মামুনের একাউন্ট থেকে ভিসা কার্ডের মাধ্যমে মাত্র পয়ত্রিশ লক্ষ টাকা উত্তোলন করে মানি লন্ডারিং অপরাধ সংঘটন করেছে এবং তারেক রহমান মূল টাকার মালিক বা ভাগিদার ছিল বা অধিক¿º আসামী তারেক রহমান ভিসা কার্ডের মাধ্যমে সিংগাপুরসÛ মামুনের সিটি ব্যাংক একাউন্ট থেকে টাকা উত্তোলন করে গোপন করেছেz </strong><br/><strong>আসামী মামুন তার একাউন্ট থেকে তার ব্যবসায়িক পার্টনার বা বন্ধু বা অন্য কোন ব্যক্তিকে অর্থ প্রদান করলে অর্থ গ্রহনকারী ব্যক্তি মানি লন্ডারিং অপরাধে অপরাধী হবেন এমন কোন বিধান আইনে বলা হয়নিz ফলে একাউন্টের প্রকৃত মালিক আসামী মামুনz তিনি তার একাউন্ট থেকে আসামী তারেক রহমানকে ৫০ হাজার বা ৫৪ হাজারের বেশী মার্কিন ডলার প্রদান করায় এবং আসামী তারেক রহমান আসামী মামুনের নিকট থেকে উক্ত অর্থ গ্রহণ করার বিষয়টি তার সম্পদ বিবরণীতে স্পষ্টভাবে উল্লেখ করায় তদ¿¹কারী কর্মকর্তা নিজে তার তদ¿¹ রিপোর্টে সম্পদ বিবরণী সম্পর্কে ব্যাখ্যা প্রদান করায় বাস¹বতার নিরীখে বিশ্লেষণ করলে দেখা যায় আসামী তারেক রহমান সাপ্লিমেন্টারী গোল্ড ভিসা কার্ডের মাধ্যমে আসামী মামুনের সিংগাপুরসÛ সিটি ব্যাংক একাউন্ট থেকে ডলার উত্তোলনের বিষয়টি ১৯/০৫/০৭ইং তারিখে দুদকের জারীকৃত সম্পদ নোটিশের প্রেক্ষিতে ০৭/০৬/০৭ইং তারিখে তারেক রহমান কর্তৃক দাখিলকৃত সম্পদ বিবরণীতে সরল বিশ্বাসে ব্যক্ত করেছেনz এতে তার কোন অসৎ উদ্দেশ্য বা দুরভিসন্ধি পরিলক্ষিত হয় নাz কাজেই উপরোক্ত আলোচনার প্রেক্ষিতে এই সিদ্ধা¿¹ আসা যায় যে, তারেক রহমান সাপ্লিমেন্টারী ত্র্রেডিট কার্ড বিদ্যমান থাকা বা কার্ডের মাধ্যমে টাকা উত্তোলন ও ব্যয় করার বিষয়ে তিনি কোন গোপন না করায় বা আড়াল না করায় তিনি ২০০২ সালের মানি লন্ডারিং আইনে বর্ণিত মতে মানি লন্ডারিং এর কোন অপরাধ করেননি এবং এই কারণে তারেক রহমানকে দোষী সাব্যসÛ করা নিরাপদ মনে করি নাz''</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The above findings of the learned trial Judge are absolutely based on surmise and conjecture. The learned trial Judge himself made out defense case on behalf of the absconding accused Rahman and thereby committed serious error of law in acquitting accused Rahman. Moreover, the learned trial judge misread and misconstrued the definition of ‘Money Laundering’ as defined in section <strong>২(ঠ), (অ), (আ</strong><strong>)</strong> [2(Tha)(A)(Aa)] of the Ain of 2002 and also failed to understand its scope and purport.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In view of the nature of the offense and allegation as brought against accused Rahman, burden is upon him to explain why the Photostat copy of his passport was submitted in obtaining supplementary Gold Visa Card in connection with the account of convict Mamun with City Bank in Singapore and why he spent huge amount of money in different countries for his personal visits, shopping and meeting medical expenses by using the said visa card.</li><li style="text-align:justify">These facts are especially within the knowledge of accused Rahman and the burden cast on him to rebut the allegation made against him. Having regarded to the fact that accused Rahman knowingfully well about the trial absconded and avoided the trial willfully and thereby, failed to discharge his burden in view of the provision of section 106 of the Evidence Act. And thus, it can be validly inferred that he is guilty of offence of Money Laundering.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Further, <u>Transactions done by accused Rahman by using supplementary Gold Visa card thus involved criminal profits and it makes him criminally responsible for the offence of laundering the amount received as ‘consultancy fee’ and other various pleas through the convict Mamun. Indisputably accused Rahman used the bank account of convict Mamun in transacting ‘dirty money’ received through illegal means (A‰ea cš’v) which is an offence under the Ain of 2002. It is a financial corruption which affects and derogates states economy and it is increased. No leniency should be shown to an individual who is found to be orchestrator of such activity of money laundering</u>. (Underlines supplied to give emphasis)</li><li style="text-align:justify">Earlier, accused Rahman had challenged the proceeding of the present case before the High Court Division by filing writ petition No.6286 of 2016 and being unsuccessful he filed Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal No.10 of 2011 before the Appellate Division <strong>[63 DLR (AD) page-18]</strong>. The said leave petition was disposed of. The Appellate Division in disposing the leave petition held that;</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The question is whether an offence committed within the validity period of Ain, 2002 be prosecuted under the provision of the Ain of 2009 when the Ain of 2002 had already been repealed by the Ordinance of 2008 on 15.04.2008 with a provision of saving clause of pending cases and proceeding which will be disposed of in such a manner as if the said Ain had not been repealed and subsequently the said Ordinance was also repealed by Ain of 2009 with another saving clause of section 31(2) of the Ain whereby pending cases and proceeding have been saved as if those were filed or initiated under provision of Ain of 2009. There is no doubt that the alleged offence was committed when the Ain of 2002 was in force. But subsequently the FIR was lodged on 26.10.2009 under the Ain of 2009. Having considered the FIR, charge-sheet and other materials on record we have found that the allegation lodged against the petitioner discloses the prima-facie case under section 2(V)(B)(C) and section 13 of the said Ain.”</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The Appellate Division has further held that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“In the instant case the alleged offence was disclosed under the provisions of section <strong>২(ট)(অ)(আ)</strong> of the Ain of 2002 but there was no pending case or proceeding under the Ain of 2002 when the said Ain of 2002 or the Ordinance of 2008 was repealed. Rather the FIR was lodged under sections 2 and 4(2) of the Ain of 2009 on 26.10.2009 long after the repeal of the Ain of 2002 by the Ordinance of 2008 and also after the enactment of the Ain of 2009 on 24.02.2009. It appears that according to the FIR occurrence took place from 01.01.2003 to 31.05.2007 when the Ain of 2002 was in operation. The Ain of 2009 was given retrospective effect from 15.04.2008 when the Ain of 2002 was repealed by the promulgation of the Ordinance of 2008. The facts and circumstances of the instant case is very unique in its nature wherein an offence committed under the repealed Ain of 2002 and the FIR was lodged much long after the repeal of the said Ain when the Ain of 2009 came into effect with the intervening Ordinance of 2008 which had already been repealed before the lodging of the FIR. It is well established that a criminal offence never abates or destroyed even after the repeal of the law under which the offence is alleged to have been committed. From the aforesaid discussions it is obvious that the Ordinance of 2008 or the Ain of 2009 has not saved the offence alleged to have been committed from 01.01.2003 to 31.05.2007 under the Ain of 2002 till the date of its repeal. According to Halsbury’s laws of England Vol.36, para-714 the general principle that an enactment which is repealed is to be treated as if it had never existed is subject to any saving which may be made expressly or by implication by the repealing enactment”.</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">The Appellate Division has also held that:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The next question is as to which procedure has to be followed for prosecuting the petitioner. The answer is that Ain of 2002 has been inserted in the schedule to the Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2004 (the “ACC Act, 2004”) and as such the procedure in respect of inquiry, investigation, conducting prosecution and holding of trial shall be governed under the provisions of the ACC Act, 2004. Since the Ain of 2002 has been incorporated in the schedule to the ACC Act, 2004 by an amendment made by the ACC (Amendment) Ordinance of 2007 and thereby the offence of money laundering disclosed under the Ain of 2002 has been made triable under the provisions of the special procedures enumerated in section 28 of the ACC Act of 2004. According to section 28(1) the offences under the Act or the offences mentioned in the schedule to the Act shall be exclusively triable by the Special Judge who has been appointed under the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958. But the offence as well as its punishment would be dealt with under the provisions of the Ain of 2002”.</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Convict Mamun previously also moved a Revisonal application vide Criminal Revision No.01 of 2013 before this Court <strong>[65 DLR, page-41, paragraph-74]</strong>. In rejecting the said application summarily the High Court Division has observed as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“It is to be noticed that Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2009 has given effect on and from 15<sup>th</sup> April, 2009 corresponding to 2<sup>nd</sup> Baishak, 1413 BS that is before the election of 9<sup>th</sup> Parliament and its 1<sup>st</sup> meeting. Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2002 had been repealed by Money Laundering Protirodh Ordinance, 2008 on 15.04.2008 with a provision of saving clause; Money Laundering Protirodh Ordinance 2008 was also repealed by the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2009 with another saving clause in section 31(2) of the Ain and there is a continuity of legislation in between the Ain of 2002 and Ain of 2009 and thus, the Ordinances in question have got no manner of application after enactment of Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2009 which has come into force before the constitution of the 9<sup>th</sup> Parliament and its first meeting and as such the question whether the Ordinance Nos.VII and VIII 2007, by which the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2002 was incorporated in the scheduled of Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 and Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958 respectively, were not placed before the first meeting of 9<sup>th</sup> Parliament and was not approved by the Parliament as per provision of Article 93(2) and (4) of the Constitution and thus it is deemed that Money Laundering Protirodh Ain, 2002 is no more in the schedule of Anti-Corruption Commission Act of 2004 and Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1958 has also become irrelevant which has got no substance. It is also a redundant issue.”</div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">In view of the above proposition, the submissions of Mr. Ali that the Durnity Daman Commission Ain, 2004 or the Ain of 2002 did not authorize the Commission to lodge or investigate any offence Committed under the Ain of 2002 have no legs to stand.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Next, we are sorry to say that possibly Mr. Ali is not aware about the amendment of the relevant Rule. Rule 24 of the Durnity Daman Commission Bidhimala 2007 has been amended by SRO No.265/Am/2007 dated 26.11.2007. By that amendment the informant officer of the Commission is legally empowered to hold investigation into the case. Thus, the submission of Mr. Ali that the investigation of the case by the informant officer of the commission is without lawful authority is baseless.</li><li style="text-align:justify">On behalf of the convict Mamun objection was raised with regard to exhibit-7, exhibit-8 and exhibit-12. Exhibit-7 is a Photostat copy of the payment order in respect of Taka 20,41,25,613.28 issued at the instance of convict Mamun by Sonali Bank, Dhaka Cantonment Corporate Branch in favour of the Government and exhibit-8 is the Photostat copy of Bank documents (19 pages) regarding Bank account No.34450546 of convict Mamun with the said Bank and exhibit-12 is the Bank documents of convict Mamun’s account with the City Bank NA, Singapore relating to statement to the credit cards.</li><li style="text-align:justify">PW-8, the Bank Officer who issued the payment order and PW-9 another Bank Officer who attested the Photostat copy of exhibit-8 and PW-10 Executive Officer of the Bank who attested the Photostat copies of the both exhibit-7 and 8 proved those documents in accordance with law. PW-9 and PW-10 corroborating each other categorically testified that original of those documents were seized earlier in connection with cantonment Police Station Case No.2(5)07 which gave rise Special Case No.01 of 2008. The said prosecution witnesses proved the authencity of those documents.</li><li style="text-align:justify">In view of the provision of section 63 of the Evidence Act the Photostat copy of its original being the secondary evidence is admissible in evidence.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Exhibit-12 was duly certified as true copy by the concerned official, having the legal custody of the original, of City Bank NA, Singapore and the said document was also duly authenticated by Lien Geon Heok, a Notary Public of Singapore, who was identified by Lien Lin Casol, Deputy Director, Singapore Law academy, Republic of Singapore, and all of those were attested by the concerned officer (Counsellor) of Bangladesh High Commission, Singapore.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Thus, exhibit-12 is a valid document and as per provision of section 78 of the Evidence Act it is admissible in evidence.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Thus, the objection raised by the defense regarding exhibit-7, 8 and 12 is not at all sustainable in eye of law.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Moreover, it is well proved from exhibit-7 and 8 that convict Mamun had opened a savings account being No.34450546 with the Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch, Dhaka and at his instance the money deposited in the account of City Bank Singapore was transferred to his said account and thereafter, the said money (Taka 20,41,25,613.28) was deposited to the Bangladesh Bank (exhibit-7) in favour of the Government. Those transactions to have been done through banking channel and as such there is no scope to deny the said undisputed facts.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It will be pertinent to say that no doubt or cloud has been created about the veracity of the prosecution case of laundering money by any irregularities, if at all occurred at the time of opening the Bank account by convict Mamun with the Sonali Bank, Cantonment Branch, Dhaka, and the defense has also not been prejudiced thereby in any manner as it was given ample opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is imperative to note that the act of money laundering is intrinsically damaging to the society in which it occurs. It is a criminal offence whose effects usually are insidious for the socio economic fabric of a country.</li><li style="text-align:justify">There are severe economic and social consequences of money laundering. These include:</li></ol><ul><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Undermining financial systems</strong>: money laundering expands the black economy, undermines the financial system and raises questions of credibility and transparency</li><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Expanding crime</strong>: money laundering encourages crime because it enables criminals to effectively use and deploy their illegal funds</li><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Criminalizing society</strong>: criminals can increase profits by reinvesting the illegal funds in businesses</li><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Reducing revenue and control</strong>: money laundering diminishes government tax revenue and weakens government control over the economy.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Source: Introduction to money laundering; Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center, Australian Government</strong>.<strong>]</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify">Money laundering is a criminal offence aimed at presenting wealth of illicit origin or the portion of wealth that has been illegally acquired or concealed from the purview of tax and other authorities, as legitimate, through the use of methods that obscure the identity of the ultimate beneficiary and the source of the ill-gotten profits. <strong>[The puppet Masters, the world Bank and UNOCD, 2001 <a href="http://star.worldbank.org/star/publication/puppet-masters">http://star.worldbank.org/star/publication/puppet-masters</a>].</strong></li><li style="text-align:justify">The possible social and political costs of money laundering, if left unchecked or deal with ineffectively, are serious. Organized crime can infiltrate financial institutions, acquire control of large sectors of the economy through investment, or offer bribes to public officials and indeed Governments. The economic and political influence of criminal organizations can weaken the social fabric, collective ethical standards, and ultimately the democratic institution of the society. In countries transitioning to democratic systems, this criminal influence can undermine the transition.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It reduces productivity in the economy’s real sector by diverting resources and encouraging crime and corruption, which makes economic growth slow and distorts the country’s economy. Ill obtained money is remitted abroad by act of laundering thus deprives national exchequer for meeting its peoples lawful needs. Civil society, print and electronic media should remain pro-active in playing pivotal role for money laundering stoppage.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Money laundering is a most organized economic crime. The object of the offender is aimed to use the proceeds of crime in the manner as if it has been earned legally. And using the ill-gotten funds in this way is possible as long as the source of the funds deposited in bank account remains concealed. This is the reason why the money launderer makes the origin proceeds of crime concealed.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Acquiring wealth illegally and keeping it concealed or assisting in accomplishing it, directly or indirectly is violation of Section <strong>২(ঠ)(অ)(আ)</strong> of the Ain of 2002. In the case in hand, not only convict Mamun alone but principally accused Rahman steered the matter of obtaining the ‘dirty money’ and getting it deposited in his friend Mamun’s Bank account in Singapore, disguising the source. Accused Rahman designed to get it happen by abusing his political position and might.</li><li style="text-align:justify">It is to be noted with regret that accused Rahman belonging to a political class which was saddled with the responsibility of directing the affairs of the country had acted as a conscious part of the financial crime. He being the mighty political elite by virtue of his position obtained dirty money in the name of ‘consultation fee’ through his close cohort’s [convict Giasuddin Al-Mamun]. This kind of corruption being backed by political influence threatens good governance, sustainable development, and democratic process.</li><li style="text-align:justify">This manner of financial crimes the upshot of achieving wealth in corrupt ways committed under political shield is increased. Time has come to get this type of criminal activities carried out by using political favour and patronization halted for the cause of well being of the country and its development process. We emphatically observe that corrupt practices and political influences indisputably make significant space for an individual or group to be indulged in such financial crime like ‘money laundering’ which leaves perverse influence on the entire society.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The trend of obtaining ill-gotten money by extending undue favour to an individual or a group, in exercise of political might must be stopped. The society should awake to condemn and prevent political patronization in accomplishing such organized financial criminal activities affecting country’s economy and development.</li><li style="text-align:justify">The victim of the financial crime like money laundering is the every citizen of this country. Accused Rahman who is found guilty of the offence of laundering the huge amount of ill-gotten funds and he was culpably a conscious part to the financial crime thus deserves no leniency. Might of the offender engaged in laundering huge amount of ill-gotten money, hiding its source and means, must be resisted by awarding appropriate punishment for the shake of country’s ongoing economic development.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Having discussed and considered as above we find merit in Criminal Appeal No.7225 of 2013 and no merit in Criminal Appeal No.7469 of 2013.</li><li style="text-align:justify">Accordingly, Criminal Appeal No.7469 of 2013 is dismissed. The judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 17.11.2013 passed by the learned Special Judge, 3<sup>rd</sup> Court, Dhaka in Special Case No.17 of 2011 arising out of Cantonment Police Station Case No.8(10)09 finding Md.

Zakir Hossain Ripon, AAG                          <br/><strong><em>...For the respondents</em></strong><br/> <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><br/><strong><u>Mohammad Ullah, J:  </u></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">On an application under Article 102 of the Constitution, this Court issued the Rule in the following terms:<br/>“Let a Rule Nisi be issued calling upon the respondents to show cause as to why the memo bearing No. <strong>শিমপ/ সিসপ্র-৩/বিএফএ /২২৬/ ২০১১-১৩</strong> dated 09.01.2013 issued under the signature of the respondent no. 8 directing the respondent no. 2 not to take any steps regarding the program of constructing 150 seats accommodating class Room and 150 bed women’s hostel for Bangladesh Female Academy (BFA) situated within Upazilla-Derai, District-Sunamganj as evident from Annexure-F(1) to the writ petition and D.O. letter No. <strong>মঃকাঃ/ডিও(বিবিধ)-৪/১২/৬৫৫</strong> dated 13.12.2012 issued by the respondent no. 9 requesting the concern Minister of Ministry of Education for taking appropriate steps for cancellation of allocation of fund in the name of Bangladesh Female Academy (BFA) situated within Upazilla-Derai, District-Sunamgnj as evident from Annexure-F to the writ petition  should not be declared to be have been passed without lawful authority and is of no legal effect and why the respondents should not be directed to allocate the fund for the project of Bangladesh Female Academy (BFA) and start construction and/or pass such other or further order or orders as to this Court may seem fit and proper.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts, for the purpose of disposal of the Rule as disclosed in the averments of the writ petition, are that the petitioner is the President Bangladesh Female Academy (the Academy), a registered non-profit organization which got registration from the Ministry of Social Welfare and from the NGO Bureau. The students of the Academy have been participating in different local and national sports and cultural events and secured various awards. The Academy was established in 2006 through the effort of the petitioner and support of the donors. Subsequently in order to build the infrastructure and accommodation facilities of the Academy, the petitioner made a representation to the concerned Ministry for allocation of funds whereupon the Cabinet Division issued a Memo on 07.02.2011 requesting to the Ministry of Education to initiate a proposal for construction of 150 seat class room and 150 seat hostel for the students. In this regard the Ministry of Education obtained an opinion from the Chief Engineer of the concerned department. Thereafter, the Chief Engineer prepared a program and forwarded it to the Ministry of Education. It has been stated that while the matter was pending before the Ministry of Finance for approval of the allocation of funds, the petitioner came to know that the local Member of Parliament, the respondent no. 9 who initially supported the proposal of the petitioner, issued a D.O. Letter to the Minister, Ministry of Education requesting him for cancellation of allocation of funds for construction of the Academy. The petitioner apprehends that on the basis of such D.O. Letter, the Ministry of Education directed the Finance Division not to allocate the fund. When the initiative was stopped the petitioner served a legal notice upon the respondents requesting them to take effective steps for construction of the Academy, but without any result; hence the writ petition and the Rule issued therein.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dr. A.K.M. Ali, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner, submits that the respondent no. 9 being the local Member of Parliament had no legal authority to issue D.O. Letter to the Ministry of Education requesting them to stop the proposal for construction of the building in order to construct the facilities for accommodation of the Academy. The learned advocate submits further that the process of construction of the Academy building or allocation of funds thereof cannot be canceled on the basis of a D.O. Letter issued the respondent no. 9. The learned advocate seeks a direction upon the respondents for allocation of funds for construction of the Academy building.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Ms. Kazi Zinat Hoque, learned Deputy Attorney General being without instruction could not assist us, however she verbally opposes the Rule.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that at the instance of the petitioner an initiative for financing the accommodation of the Academy had been taken by the Ministry of Education. Although the local Member of Parliament had recommended in favour of the Academy at the inception of the process he raised an objection against it later on and wrote a letter to the Ministry of Education requesting not to allocate funds in favour of the Academy. It is apparent from the impugned letter dated 09.01.2013 (Annexure-‘G-2’) that the Ministry of Education requested the Secretary, Ministry of Finance Division not to take further initiative  with regard  to the construction of the Academy building on the basis of the D.O. Letter of the local Member of Parliament.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It has repeatedly come to our notice and particularly in writ matters that certain Members of Parliament have often been requesting/ recommending the concerned government authorities and autonomous bodies upon issuing demi-official letters for certain benefits/ favours including grant of lease of property to a  certain individual or group, appointment of  particular persons in the posts of Presidents or Members of the Managing Committees of recognized educational institutions or for approval or disapproval of such Managing Committee etc. or even interfering with certain processes initiated for certain purposes. We therefore, deem it necessary to dwell into the legal consequence of such letter popularly known as D.O letters. A D.O. Letter is an abbreviation of the term “demi official letter” generally used in correspondence between two entities the issuing person or authority and government or non-government officials for an interchange or communication of opinion or information without any formality of the prescribed procedure. This sort of communication has got no legal consequence i.e. the recipient of a D.O. Letter is not lawfully bound to act on the basis of such a letter. However, a Member of Parliament or any other person may issue a D.O. Letter with a specific request or recommendation without hampering, curtailing or infringing any statutory right or public policy. Being a public representative it would not be prudent for a member of parliament to seek demand or claim or a favour for any person or a particular group to the detriment of others in violation of prescribed laws of the land and the interest of the people in general. In the instant case it is seen that at the inception of the process of raising funds for accommodation for the Academy, the local Member of Parliament recommended for the same but at a later stage in the same transaction he issued a D.O. Letter to the government functionary against his initial stand requesting not to allocate any fund for construction of the Academy. We refrain from making any comment about the conduct of the respondent no. 9 inasmuch as it does not involve question of law but of ethic. The recipient of the D.O Letter may or may not honour the recommendation of the issuing person keeping in mind that the action or inaction is in accordance with prescribed law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">With regard to the contention of the petitioner that his legal rights have been infringed by the issuance of the impugned letter it appears that neither any fund has been allocated for construction of the accommo-dation of the Academy nor any plan was taken for the said purpose in the respective fiscal year under public or a private scheme. In other words, the government has not made its estimates for financing of the Academy. The petitioner having not acquired any vested right in such process of the government for financing the Academy cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction to establish his claim in any manner. Since no legal right of the petitioner has been infringed in the act of stoppage of the initiative, we find no reason to interfere with the impugned letter.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the Rule is discharged.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">However, on the facts and circumstances of the issue, we do not see any impediment for further initiatives for allocation of funds in a subsequent fiscal year as had been taken by the government for construction of infrastructure and accommodate facilities of the Academy in question.<br/><strong>Ed. </strong></div></div></div>

Nizamul Huq, J.</u></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">This appeal at the instance of the appellants has been filed against the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 21.04.2002 passed by the Divisional Special Judge, Rajshahi Division, Rajshahi in Special Case No. 3 of 1998 (Natore) convicting the appellants under section 409/109 of the Penal Code and sentencin them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 02 (two) years and to pay a fine of Tk. 1,20,130/- ( One lac twenty thousand and one hundred thirty) only in default to suffer imprisonment for 03 (three) months more.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution case in short is this that to reconstruct a road from Lokmanpur School to Maria Railgate, Surappur and Gaonpara, Rampara care Road, the Project Chairman and Union Porishod Chairman accused appellant Nowsher Ali was allotted by Bagatipara Upazila Porishod through memo no. 142(5) dated 09.02.1986, 500 monds of wheat at the first installment then through memo no. 56 (5) dated 02.04.1986, 700 monds of wheat in 2<sup>nd</sup> installment then through memo no. 143(5) dated 28.04.1986, 700 monds of wheat in 3<sup>rd</sup> installment and vide memo no. 201 (5) dated 13.05.1986, 900 monds of wheat in the 4<sup>th</sup> installment in all 2800 monds of wheat was allotted and those wheat were withdrawn as usual. After calculation of the seize of the work done by Care engineer Rajshahi and Upazila Project Implement Officer Bagatipara, of the said Project an amount of 695.17 monds of wheat were kept which has not been used in the hand of the Project committee and a letter was issued vide memo no. 663 to the Project committee to return the said wheat or equivalent money but those has not been deposited and the accused persons conjointly with each other has defalcated the said wheat neighing 695.17 maunds value of which is taka 1,25,130.60 poisa.   </li><li style="text-align: justify;">The case was investigated by the Anti-Corruption Officer Natore and after receiving sanction and perusal of the records he submitted a charge sheet against the appellants under Section 409/109 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 on 31.10.1997. Then the case was transferred to the divisional Special Judge, Rajshahi and was mumbered as Special Case No. 03 of 1998 (Natore). Against the accused appellant Nowsher Ali charge under Section 409 of the Penal Code read with section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 was framed. Against the other accused appellants charge under sectioin 409/109 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 was framed to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution examined 14 PWs and then the accused persons were examined under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure they again claimed innocence and they further stated that they will not produce any defence witnesses.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Accused Abdul Kuddus expired during pendency of this trial and as such the case proceeded against the accused appellants. Then the learned Judge vide Judgment and order mentioned above found the appellants guilty and convicted and sentenced them as mentioned herein above. Against the said Judgment and order of conviction and sentence the appellants have preferred this appeal.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During pendency of this appeal and at the time of admission of the appeal the accused appellants have been enlarged on bail by this court and they are still continuing on the same bail.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Points for determination of this appeal is weather the accused appellants have done any offence under Section 409 and Section 409/109 of the Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of Act II of 1947 and also weather the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court can be upheld.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">No one appears for the appellants all though the appeal is in the list for quite a long time. However the state has been represented by the learned Deputy Attorney General.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">I have heard the learned Deputy Attorney General and perused the impugned Judgment and the Lower Courts Records. It appears that PW. 1 in his evidence stated that he was the Chairman of the Upazila Porishod of Bagatipara Upazila in 1986 and at that time accused appellant Md. Nowsher Ali was the Union Porishod Chairman of number. 1 Paka Union. At that time from Lokmanpur School to Maria Railgate, Surappur and Gaonpara to Rampara for reconstruction of the road, a case Project was taken and the work was under the year 1985-86. For the said Project in 4(four) installments a total of 2800 monds of wheat was allotted. According to the technical committee the Project committee did not do any work in the Project and the work has not been done for the amount of 695.17 sers of wheat. He admitted that he has filed the FIR the Project Chairman was asked to return the remaining wheat but he did not return it. He further stated that he gave the letter to the Project Chairman on 01.10.1986 to return the defalcated wheat and again letter was given on 11.10.1986 but the Project Chairman did not return the money. He stated in cross-examination that eajher was lodged on the basis of the technical report. He cannot say what was the length of the Project road. He also stated that he does not remember weather a part of the Project field fell within the land of Sugar Mill and as such the direction of the road was abit changed and more 930 feet road was cut. He was not present at the time of the post work measurement. He admitted that he has heard that the calculation of 930 feet road has not been taken PW. 2 the anti-corruption officer name Rammohon Nath stated that he was inspector of Natore DAB from 11.11.1985 to 21.06.1990 and he investigated the instant case. He further stated that the Upazila Chairman asked the Project Chairman to return the wheat weighing 695 monds 17seers but that was not returned and as such the case was lodged. He admitted in this cross-examination that he has not taken the post work measurement and that on 03.08.1986 Project Implement Officer Lutfur Rahman and supervisor Birandro Nath took the measurement of the Project and on 14.06.1986 Care engineer Project Chairman jointly took measurement of the Project and in both the measurement Project Chairman was present PW. 3 was tendered. PW. 4 stated regarding seizure of some documents. PW. 5 is the seizure list witness. PW. 6 stated that he deposited the report regarding taking measurement of the Project on 12.06.1986. On 03.06.1986 the Project Implication Officer in presence of him measured the Project work. He stated in his cross-examination that he does not remember whether a part of the Project road falls in the land of Natore Sugar Mills and as such the route was abit changed and the measurement of that road was taken. The Care engineer also took measurement of the project and he does not remember whether any difference between the two majormeants are available.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">PW. 7 the project Implementation Officer stated that the I.O seized some documents in his presence. PW. 8 denied his signature in the seizure list exhibit 4 and was declared hostile. He stated that he has got knowledge about seizing of documents exhibit number. 4 and he denied his signature there. PW. 9 was tendered. He stated in cross-examination that the work has been done as directed in the Project but he is not expert in the Project. PW. 10 stated that he is a labour and he has received his wheat for his work. PW.11, PW. 12 are also labours and they have also admitted that they had received their wheat for their works. PW. 13 P.I.O stated that for this Project 2977 monds wheat was allotted and the Project committee withdrawn 2800 monds of wheat in 04 (four) installments and the work was done for 2240 monds of wheat and no work was done for 560 monds wheat and the accused persons defauleted those wheat. He was engaged in the looking after of the Project work. The Project work ought to have been completed within 31.05.1986 and on 03.06.1986 he took the post work measurement of the work. He admitted in cross-examination that 930 feet road of Lokmanpar Bazar to Maria rail gate was diverted and the calculation of that work has not been taken at the time of final calculation. He denied the suggestion that the road was diverted as the road of the Project involves the land of Gopalpur sugar mill. After 03.06.1986 no measurement of the work has been taken. He admitted that on that road of the Project now a days the cars of cow and buffalo moves. PW. 14 only submitted the charge sheet.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">These are the evidence available in this case. It appears that by producing documents, the prosecution has been successful to prove that the wheat in question amounting 2800 monds of was given to the Project committee for construction of the Project road. There is no denial of the fact that the work was done but the question is for not doing the work in full for 560 monds of wheat. It is available in the evidence that the road was diverted may be for the reason that the Project road falls in the land of the one sugar mill or for any other reason but it has been admitted by the prosecution witnesses that the road was diverted and more 970 feet road was constructed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is available in the evidence even by the Project Implementation Officer and other witnesses that finally when the measurement was taken then the measurement of that road measuring 930 feet was not taken. The learned trial Judge in his Judgment stated that at the time of measurement the 930 feet of road was not measured is not acceptable and reasonable but he has not given any reason for that observation rather we have in evidence that those 930 feet road was not measured in the final measurement. As such now the question is what is the cost involved in construction of that 930 feet of road and there is no evidence in this case and also in the Judgment passed by the learned trial court that for this 930 feet of road this much of wheat is required to be used.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution is silent in this respect. Considering all this things that 930 feet road was constructed beyond the Project proposal and that has not been measured in the final measurement of the Project and this part of extra work had to be done by the Project committee because the fact that the Project road falls in the land of the one of the Sugar Mills. Thus a doubt is created weather the non consideration has caused any miscarriage. And I am of the view that for this reasons a doubt is created in the prosecution case as a whole. And as such the accused appellants are entitled to get the benefit of doubt.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Considering all this things I am of the view that the case of defalcation against the accused appellants have not been established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt and as such the appellants are entitled to get benefit of doubt and the appeal is to be allowed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The appeal is thus allowed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed upon the appellants by the learned Divisional Special Judge, Rajshahi is hereby set-aside. The accused appellants are released from their bail bonds.</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">    Send down the Lower Courts Records immediately.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Criminal </strong></a><strong>Appeal No. 957 of 2002</strong></div></div></div></div>

For the Opposite Party-State.</em></strong><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>JUDGMENT</strong></div><br/><strong><u>Md. Farid Ahmed Shibli, J:</u></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">         This Criminal Revision, at the instance of the accused Mohammad Mazharul Haque Monsur, is directed against the order dated 13.05.2013 passed by the learned Joint Metropolitan Session Judge of the 4<sup>th</sup> Court, Chittagong in Sessions Case no. 2864 of 2011 arising out of C.R. Case No. 935 of 2011.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Rule has been issued calling upon the Opposite Parties to show cause as to why the impugned order rejecting an application under section 265C of the Code for discharging the accused-petitioner and framing of the charge against him under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (shortly “the N.I. Act) should not be set aside and/or pass such other order or orders as to this Court may deem fit and proper.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts relevant for disposal of this case are as follows: On the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 12.08.2010 some Mir Kashim Chowdhury (i.e. the complainant-opposite party) transferred his shares in “the Sonali Cotton Mills Ltd.” (shortly “the Company) to one Mohammad Majharul Hoque Monsur (i.e. the accused-petitioner), who drew the cheque having no. CAV 9752121 dated 06.02.2011 for Taka 3 (three) crores in favour of the complainant-opposite party in order to adjust estimated value of the company-shares purchased by him (the accused-petitioner) from the complainant-opposite party and his elder brother namely Solaiman Chowdhury, According to the petition of complaint, Solaiman Chowdhury, who was also a share-holder of the company, owed Taka 3 crores to his younger brother i.e. the complainant-opposite party, in whose favour the accused-petitioner issued the said cheque as the security of payment of the shares’ value. Although the cheque was drawn against an account of the accused-petitioner maintained with the Basic Bank, Agrabad Branch, Chittagong, but on presentation it was returned unpaid. Owing to that, the complainant-opposite party sending a legal notice to the accused-petitioner demanded the cheque-money, but the latter failed to make any payment. Consequently the petition of complaint dated 23.06.2011 was filed within the prescribed time-limit observing all legal formalities.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On receipt of the petition of complaint, the learned Judicial Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under section 138 of the N.I Act against the accused-petitioner and sent the record to the Court of learned Metropolitan Session Judge of Chittagong, who in his term again transferred the record to the 4<sup>th</sup> Joint Metropolitan Session Judge, Chittagong for hearing and disposal. On the date fixed for charge hearing, the learned Joint Metropolitan Session Judge after giving both sides a reasonable opportunity of being heard decided the petition filed by the accused-petitioner under section 265C of the Code refusing to discharge the accused-petitioner and framed the charge against him under section 138 of the N.I Act passing the impugned order dated 13.05.2013. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with that order, the accused-petitioner has filed the instant application for criminal revision stating inter alia that the complainant-opposite party ought to file the complaint under section 138 of the N.I Act after exhausting the provision of arbitration clause stated in the MOU, but he did not do that and thereby made the proceedings including the impugned order liable to be set aside; and that as the provision of section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001 over-rides all other recourses available under any other law, the Trial Court ought to consider the said legal aspect of the matter and allow the prayer for discharging the accused-petitioner. It is claimed that now it is inevitable for this Court to set the impugned order at naught discharging the accused-petitioner therefrom.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Learned Senior Advocate Mr. A.F. Hasan Arif appearing with learned Advocates Mr. Zakir Hossain Munshi and Mr. Md. Modersher Ali Khan for the accused-petitioner and learned Advocate Mr. Md. Ashek-E-Rasul appearing with Ms. Farhana Islam for the Opposite-Party have entered appearance on behalf of the parties and participated in the hearing.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Zakir Hossain Munshi, learned Advocate for the accused-petitioner has made submission centering upon the following points:- <em>firstly</em>- as the Arbitration Case filed by the accused-petitioner under the arbitration-clause of the MOU is still pending before the Court of learned District Judge, the proceedings of the Sessions Case including framing of the charge under section 138 of the N.I Act are not maintainable; and <em>secondly</em>- as the cheque in question was drawn without any consideration, it would create no obligation of payment upon the accused-petitioner in view of section-43 of the N.I. Act and the alleged bouncing of the cheque would therefore not constitute any offence under section 138 of the N.I. Act.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Referring to the MOU dated 12.08.2010 Mr. Munshi amplifies whole gamut of facts contending inter alia that both parties including the complainant-opposite party had agreed to settle all the disputes, that may arise between them, through mutual negotiation appointing an arbitrator, but in spite of being a party to the said document the complainant-opposite party in lieu of pursuing the arbitration-clause of the MOU has straightaway lodged the petition of complaint under section 138 of the N.I. Act in defiance of the legal bar laid down in section-7 of the Arbitration Act, 2001. Mr. Munshi contends that as the accused-petitioner has already filed the Arbitration Miscellaneous Case no. 165 of 2014, which is still pending in the Court of learned District Judge, the proceedings of the Sessions Case including the impugned charge-framing order under section 138 of the N.I Act are completely illegal and not tenable in the eye of law.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In reply Mr. Ashek-E-Rasul has drawn our attention to clause-11 of the MOU dated 12.08.2010, which runs as follows:- “The validity of this MOU is for 6 (six) months from the date of signing. The time of MOU will be extended on mutual negotiation of both the parties.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that validity of the MOU, as referred to above, already expired on 12.02.2011 and its time was not further extended. The cheque in question was bounced on 12.04.2011 and the notice demanding cheque-money was received by the accused-petitioner on 26.04.2011, on which the cause of action under section 138 of the N.I. Act arose, but at that time the MOU had no legal force or validity. So, for obvious reasons the complainant-petitioner did not pursue for negotiation invoking the arbitration clause of the MOU. We therefore do not find any substance in the allegations so far as made by the accused-petitioner on the point above.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Citing the Case of Parveen and another-Vs.-the State Reported in 51 DLR(1999)473 Mr. Munshi contends that section 7 of the Arbitration Act 2001 being a special law containing the non-obstante clause should prevail over any proceeding under the N.I, which does not have any such overriding provision. The entire proceedings including the impugned charge-framing order under section 138 of the N.I. Act, as contended by Mr. Munshi, suffer from serious legal infirmity and are liable to be set aside.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Arbitration Miscellaneous Case No. 165 of 2014, as it reveals, was filed by the accused-petitioner on 13.08.2014, whereas the petition of complainant under section 138 of the N.I. Act had been filed on 23.06.2011 that was around 3½ years prior to filing of the Arbitration Miscellaneous Case. On the basis of a supplementary affidavit, the accused petitioner is now trying to castigate the impugned order, which was passed on 31.05.2013, showing a plea of the Arbitration Case, which has recently been filed and that is around one year after passing of the impugned order. Since 6 months’ validity of the MOU dated 12.08.2010 expired about 3½ years’ back, in such predicaments we do not find any earthly reason for the accused-petitioner to indulge in pursuing the arbitration clause or of late filing of a case to that effect.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Ashek-E-Rosul refers to the case of Shahnewaz Akhan-Vs- The State and another reported in 19 BLT(HCD) (2011) 349, where their Lordships decided a similar legal discourse holding the followings:-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“… there is no legal bar in filing a criminal case for criminal liability before the Court having jurisdiction notwithstanding the fact that a civil suit is pending over a self-same matter. An aggrieved person cannot be precluded from filing a criminal case if criminal offence is committed in spite of the fact that there is an arbitration clause in an agreement made, between the parties.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In view of the above decision of the apex Court coupled with the attending facts of this case, <em>it transpires that the proceedings initiated on the petition of complaint under</em> <em>section 138 of the N.I. Act cannot be hindered by or shackled with any proceeding initiated on an arbitration clause. </em></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the second point, learned Senior Advocate Mr. A.F. Hasan Arif appearing for the accused-petitioner contends that since no consideration was passed or transacted before issuance of the cheque in question, it cannot therefore create any legal obligation upon the drawer of the cheque i.e. the accused-petitioner and for that reason any failure of payment as alleged on the part of the accused-petitioner would not constitute any offence under section 138 of the N.I. Act. Mr. Arif further contends that all legal ingredients of section-138 and their ramifications need to be considered without prejudice to any other provisions of the N.I Act and that is why the cheque in question cannot be used as a sheet-anchor of the proceedings in view of section 43 of the Act.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In response to the above contention, Mr. Ashek-E-Rasul draws out attention to the very contents and construction of section 138(1) focusing their changes occurred before and after the amendment by Act XVII of 2000. Before the said amendment, a cheque was drawn “for the discharge in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability” but the said phrase of the section, as it reveals, has been omitted by Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2000 (Act XVII of 2000). Presently, no such pre-condition is applicable for any cheque issued against the bank account of the drawer.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Ashek-E-Rasul has emphatically referred to the case of SM Emdadul Hossain (Bulbul)-Vs-Jinnur Hossain and another reported in 15 BLC(AD)(2010)146, where their Lordships observed-</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Whether any debt or liability at all exists or not is a question of facts to be determined in a proceeding under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. One of the ingredients for initiating a proceeding under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is refusal to honour a cheque and when there is such prima-facie case, the proceedings cannot be quashed….”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the above decision of the apex Court, Mr. Arif hardly finds anything to controvert or say anything more in this context. In the instant case, <em>whether the cheque in</em> <em>question was drawn against any liability or not is a pure question of fact and without awarding ample opportunity to sift those facts, we cannot allow anyone to obstruct the course of justice depriving the complainant-opposite party, who may prove his claims and allegations on trial. </em>It is thus abundantly clear that by refusing the petition under section 265C of the Code and framing the charge under section 138 of the N.I. Act the Court of Session has not committed any error of law or fact and that is why this criminal revision does not warrant any interference of this Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Be that as it may, as there are serious disputes and discourses between the parties on their business ethos and accounts of shares transferred between them, we must keep the way open to resolve those disputes on trial. At the time of charge hearing, the Court of Joint Metropolitan Session in true sense had no legal scope to consider or decide those facts and it was therefore well justified to refuse the prayer filed under section 265C of the Code.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regard being had to what we have discussed above on both questions of law and relevant facts of the case, we are of the view that the learned Joint Metropolitan Session Judge has committed no error or mistake in passing the impugned order, so the instant petition for criminal revision must fail.</li></ol><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is discharged and the order of stay granted earlier by this Court stands vacated. The office is directed to transmit copy of this judgment to all concerned.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ed. </strong><br/> </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Criminal </strong></a><strong>Revision No. 830 of 2013</strong></div></div></div></div>

Ziaul Karim, J:</u></strong><div style="text-align: justify;">         By this Rule, the petitioners have challenged the legality and propriety of the order dated 08-03-2015 passed by learned Joint District Judge, Second Court, Dhaka, in Title Suit no. 850 of 2013 allowing an application for amendment of the plaint under Order VI Rule 17 and section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure( briefly as the Code).</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Materials facts leading to this Rule are that the plaintiff instituted Title Suit no. 1036 of 2011, subsequently re-numbered as Title Suit no. 850 of 2013 in the first Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka, under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act for recovery of possession into the flat described in the schedule land of the plaint stating that Mrs. Safia Ashraf Ali wife of late Syed Ashraf Ali being the owner of the suit plot entered into an agreement with the proforma defendant nos. 3-5 for construction of multistoried building and executed registered power of attorney being deed no. 2202 dated 22-05-2003 who later proposed to transfer the suit flat to him and he agreed to purchase the same at a consideration of Tk. 9,58,500/-. Later he purchased the suit flat by a registered kabala deed no. 6981 dated 24-09-2008 and the possession was handed over to him. He has been paying rent of the flat by mutating his name and took loan for Tk.21,00,000/- from Janata Bank on 14-10-2009 by mortgaging the deed. Subsequently the defendant no.1 dispossessed him on 05-07-2011. Hence the suit.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Defendant nos. 1 and 2 contested the suit by filing written statement denying all materials allegations made in the plaint.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In suit, the plaintiff by an application dated 29-04-2014 sought to amend his plaint under Order VI Rule 17 read with Section 151 of the Code for incorporating some facts along with the following facts:	<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li><strong>বাদীর  আরজির ১২ নং পৃষঠার ২য় লাইনে </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>হওয়ার </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>শব্দের পর </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>টাকার</strong><strong>′′</strong><strong> শব্দের পূর্বে এর বেদখলে হওয়ার ৬ মাসের মধ্যে  মোকদ্দমা  দায়ের করায় নালিশী সম্পত্তি বর্তমান বাজার মূল্য ৯,৫৮,৫০০/- টাকা অত্র মোকদ্দমার তায়দাদ করিয়া তদুপরি মোট ১৯,১৭০/- টাকা এর ৫০% ৯,৫৮৫/- </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>বাক্যটি  কর্তিত  হইয়া তদসহলে</strong><strong>′′</strong><strong> ২নং বিবাদীর নামীয়  দলিলের মূল্য ২৫,৫০,০০০/- (পঁচিশ লক্ষ পন্ব·াশ হাজার) টাকা ধার্য্য করা হইল এবং স্বত্ব ঘোষণা ও খাস দখল মোকদ্দমা বিধায়  আইনের বিধান মতে সর্ব উচ্চ কোর্ঢ~ ফি ৪৬,০০০/-(ছিচল্লিশ হাজার) বাক্য গুলো  আরজিতে  প্রতিসহাপিত হইয়া  আরজি  সংশোধিত হইবে z </strong></li><li><strong>বাদীর আরজির ১২ নং পৃষ্ঠার  ৯নং দফার ৯নং লাইনের নিচে  </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>ঘ</strong><strong>′′</strong><strong> শব্দ বসিবে তৎপর নালিশী  </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>ক</strong><strong>′′</strong><strong> তফসিলের  সম্পত্তিতে  বাদীর স্বত্ব  আছে মর্মে ঘোষণার এক ডিএ্রী দিতে  </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>বাকীটি  সংযোজিত  হইয়া আরজি  সংশোধিত হইবে এবং তৎপর  </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>ঙ</strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>  শব্দ  বসিবে তৎপর ২নং বিবাদী নামীয়  বিগত ০৮-০১-২০১৪ ইং তারিখে রেজিষ্ট্রিকৃত  দলিল নং  ৮৩টি ভুয়া  বে-আইনী অ~~বধ অকার্য্যকর  পণ প্রবৃওি  হীন  তন্ব·কতা  পূর্ণ  অসৎ উদ্দেশ্য প্রণোদিত  কাগজে দলিল বিধায়  উও্র  দলিলটি  বাদীর উপর বাধ্যকর নহে মর্মে   ঘোষণার  ডিএ্রী দিতে </strong><strong>′′</strong><strong>  বাক্য কয়টি  আরজিতে  সংযোজিত  হইয়া  আরজি ও রেজিষ্টার  সংশোধিত হইবে z  </strong><strong>′</strong></li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;">Contesting defendants challenged the application by filing written objection stating that the proposed amendment will chance the nature and character of the suit.

In an ordinary suit of that kind if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing his title as well as possession he is bound to succeed. Even if he is unable to prove his title he can succeed on the basis of prior possession alone. But the suit can easily be defeated if the defendant succeeds in proving a good title in himself or another. In that case the presumption  in favour of the plaintiff is displaced. In such a suit, therefore, the title of both the parties can be brought in issue and can be considered by the court. A suit under S. 9 of the Specific Relief Act is however an entirely different kind of action. That section gives a special privilege to persons in possession who take action promptly. In case they are dispossessed it entitles them to succeed simply by proving (1) that they were in possession, (2) that they have been dispossessed by the defendant, (3) that the dispossession is not in accordance with law, and (4) that the dispossession took place without six months of the suit. </em><br/><em>No question of title either of the plaintiff or of the defendant can be raised or gone into in that case. The plaintiff will be entitled to succeed without proving any title on which he can fall back upon and the defendant cannot succeed even though he may be in a position to establish the best of all titles. The restoration of possession in such a suit is however always subject to a regular title suit and the person who has the real title or even the better title cannot therefore be prejudiced in any way by a decree in such a suit. It will always be open to him to establish his title in a regular suit and to recover back possession.″</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The learned Advocate appearing for the opposite party no.1 submits that the proposed amendment will not change the nature and character of the suit rather the same is necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties. He adds that the proposed amendment will settle the question whether during the pendency of the suit the plaintiff was dispossessed. He lastly submits that  considering such aspect  the learned Judge of the Court below allowed the proposed  amendment of the plaint, which calls for no interference by this Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In support of his contentions he refers the following cases:</li></ol><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Khaledur Reza Chowdhury (Md) Vs.

Thereby he instituted the suit under Section 9 of the Specific Relief Act for summarily relief. During pendencing of the suit he sought for amendment by incorporating some facts which relates to declaration of his title, recovery of Khas possession and declaration that the certain deed is fraud fraudulent, inoperative and not binding upon him.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For the convenience of understanding the Provisions of Order VI Rule 17 of the Code reads as hereunder:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>17- The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter on amend  his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question of controversy between the parties.    </em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, Order VI Rule 17 of the Code provides that the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend  his pleadings in such manner and on such term as may be just and necessary for the purpose of determining the real question of controversy between the parties. It is pertinent to point out that if a person who is in possession is dispossessed he has right to claim back possession from the person who dispossessed him. Even if he is unable to prove his title he can succeed on the basis of prior possession alone. A suit under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act is however an entirely different kind of action.

We find that one of the fundamental principles governing the amendment of the pleadings is that all the controversies between the parties as far as possible should be included and multiplicity of the proceedings avoided.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, we hold that the proposed amendment is not at all necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions of controversies between the parties and proper adjudication of the suit. Moreover, the respective party will prove their own case by adducing evidence, at the time of trial.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">In the case of Abdul Mutaleb Vs. Ershad Ali 1998 BLD (AD) 121= 4 BLC (AD) 150 held:<br/><em>"Since all rules of the Court are intended to secure the proper administration of justice, it is essential that they should be made to serve and be subordinate to that purpose so that full powers of amendment may be enjoyed and, as  such, it should always be liberally exercised. The only limitation in allowing an amendment of the plaint is that the proposed amendment should not change the fundamental character and nature of the suit.  The settled law is that amendment of pleadings may be allowed at any stage of the proceedings for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversies between the parties. </em>"</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">This view receives support in the cases of Md. Khaledur Reza  Chowdhury Vs. Saleha Begum and others 1997 BLD(AD) 86=2 BLC(AD) 20, S.N. Roy Chowdhury Vs. A. Jabber and others 1994 BLD-229=46 DLR 273. Moyjuddin Mondal Vs. Bena Rani Das and others 45 DLR 154 and M.A. Jahangir and others Vs. Abdul Malek and others 41 DLR 389.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, the learned Judge of the Court below without proper appreciating the real question of facts and law allowed the application for such amendment, thereby committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Moreover the impugned order in its entirety is not well founded in the facts and circumstances of the case. So, the grounds urged and contentions advanced by the learned Counsel for the opposite party no.1` are not the correct exposition of law and facts. However, we have gone through the decisions as referred by him. We are in respectful agreement with the principles enunciated therein but the facts leading to those cases are distinguishable to that of the instant case. Therefore, we are unable to accept his submissions. On the contrary, the submissions advanced by the learned Counsel for the petitioners prevail and appear to have a good deals of force.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the light of discussions made above and the preponderant judicial views emerging out of the authorities referred to above, we are of the view that the impugned order suffers from legal infirmities which calls for interference by this Court. Thus the Rule having merit succeeds.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is made absolute without any order as to cost. The impugned order dated 08-03-2015 passed by learned Joint District Judge, Second Court, Dhaka, in Title Suit no. 850 of 2013 allowing amendment of the plaint is hereby set aside. The application for amendment dated 29-04-2014 is rejected. The suit shall proceed in accordance with law.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">        The office is directed to communicate the order at once.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong><br/> </div></div></div>

It is further necessary to mention that nowhere in the decision of the Board the question of violation of the Regulations or any irregularity with regard to the process of election of the Managing Committee has been raised.

It is to be noted here that there is a provision in regulation 9 that the tenure of the Managing Committee of an educational institution would be of two years from the date of its first meeting to be held under the provisions of regulation 33 of the Regulations.

The affairs of the school is run by a Managing Committee whose  tenure is 2(two) years as contemplated in the Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Dhaka (Governing Body and Managing Committee of non-Government Educational Institution at the Intermediate and Secondary level) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as “the Regulations”). The Regulations have been framed under the provisions of section 39 of the Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961 (E.P. Ordinance No. XXXIII of 1961). Prior to the expiry of the tenure of the previous managing committee, the respondent no. 5 being the headmaster of the school initiated the process for holding an election of the managing committee in June, 2012. The proforma respondent no. 6 being the Presiding and Upazilla Education Officer published the election schedule on 19.06.2012 fixing 13.08.2012 as the date for holding election. In terms of the schedule, the election took place on the stipulated date in accordance with the Regulations without any objection from any quarter. The same day the respondent no. 6 declared and published the unofficial result of the said election declaring a 9(nine) member committee (“the Managing Committee”) in which the petitioner had been elected as a member from the category of reserved family guardians. The respondent no. 5, the headmaster of the school was also inducted as a member of the Managing Committee by dint of his position. Thus the total number of members of the Managing Committee stood at 10(ten). The official election result was subsequently published by the proforma respondent no. 6 on 28.08.2012. It is stated in the petition that the election was held in a transparent manner and that at no point of time no one raised any objection about the process of holding the election and result thereof. Pursuant to the declaration of the unofficial result dated 13.08.2012, the respondent no. 5 on 23.08.2012 issued letters to the members of the newly elected Managing Committee notifying them that the meeting of the newly formed Committee would be held on 28.08.2012 with a view to electing the Chairman thereof. Accordingly, on 28.12.2012, a meeting was held in presence of 7(seven) members out of 10(ten) which included the petitioner. In the meeting the Chairman and the co-opted member (person interested in education) were being elected by the members of the said meeting presided over by Mr. Shawkat Hossain (Shamim). The meeting elected Mr. Abul Hossain Howlader as the Chairman of the Managing Committee considering his remarkable performance as Chairman of the immediate past Managing Committee of the school. Mr. M. M. Tofazzal Hossain was elected as a person interested in education as the co-opted member of the Managing Committee. On the same day, i.e., on 28.08.2012, the headmaster (respondent no. 5) of the school issued a letter to the respondent no. 3, Inspector of schools informing that the election of the Managing Committee was duly held on 13.08.2012 and the election of the Chairman along with the co-opted member of the Managing Committee was also held on 28.08.2012. This information was sent by the respondent no. 5 in compliance with the provisions of regulation 29(3) of the Regulations for according necessary approval of the Board.  It is stated that the local Member of Parliament started to motivate and influence the elected members to withdraw their support for the elected Chairman of the Managing Committee. But the elected committee members declined to respond to such influence. The local Member of Parliament (M.P.) directed the headmaster of the school to issue a notice directing Mr. Abdur Razzaque one of the Member of the Managing Committee to meet with the M.P. In subordination to the said direction the headmaster wrote a letter to that effect. A copy of the said letter dated 27.09.2012 has been annexed to the Writ Petition as Annexure ‘H’. While the members of the Managing Committee were waiting for approval of the Board, all on a sudden, the respondent no. 5 came to know from the memo dated 20.12.2012 issued under the signature of the respondent no. 3, Inspector of schools about disapproval of the elected Managing Committee. Thereafter on 06.01.2013 another memo was issued under the signature of the respondent no. 3 forming an ad hoc committee for dealing with the affairs of the school. It has been further alleged that neither the Memo dated 20.12.2012 nor 06.01.2013 had been communicated to any of the members of the Managing Committee through official process. However, the respondent no. 5 unofficially received a copy of the memo dated 06.01.2013 delivered to him by an unknown person. Challenging the aforesaid decision of the respondent no. 3, the Inspector of schools, the petitioner being one of members of the newly elected Managing Committee approached this Court and obtained the Rule and the order of stay as stated above.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">At the outset, Mr. T.H. Khan, learned Senior Counsel appearing with  Mr. A. K.M. Jaglul Haider Afric, learned Advocate for the petitioner, submits that the petitioner was duly elected as a member of the Managing Committee in accordance with the Regulations and when no allegation of any irregularities were raised from any quarter with regard to the process of election, the  formation of  an ad hoc committee without approval of the  elected committee was wholly illegal, malafide and  the same had been done at the behest of the local Member of Parliament and, therefore, the impugned order should be declared to be illegal and without lawful authority. Mr. Khan drawing our attention to the report of the inquiry committee dated 28.11.2012 submits that on the basis of a decision of the inquiry committee, approval of the elected Managing Committee had not been given by the Board without giving any opportunity of being heard to any of the members of the committee and as such the principles of natural justice had been violated in the instant case. The learned Counsel questions the basis and rationale of the inquiry which took place behind the back of the petitioner as well as the other members of the newly elected Managing Committee. The learned Counsel lastly submits that after the election of the Managing Committee and the Chairman thereof, there is a procedure under the Regulations to send the result along with the minutes of the meeting to the Board for its approval and the Board has no option but to approve the committee as its routine work.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Per contra, Mr. Sashanka Shekhar Sarkar, learned Deputy Attorney General appearing for the respondent no. 3, submits that the Inspector of schools found that after the election within the stipulated period the list of the elected committee had not been sent to the Board for its approval and on the allegation of some irregularities an inquiry was held wherein it has been revealed that the meeting for electing the Chairman of the Managing Committee was held under duress  and as such the Board rightly declined to approve the Managing Committee.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We have heard the submissions of the learned Advocate for the petitioner and the learned Deputy Attorney General for the respondent no. 3 and perused the writ petition, the affidavit-in-opposition and the affidavit-in-reply including the annexures thereto.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It appears that an election schedule was declared on 19.06.2012 fixing the date for filing of the nomination paper by 21-23.07.2012. The date for scrutiny of the nomination paper was fixed for 24.07.2012 and thereafter, the 25<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> July, 2012 was fixed for preferring an appeal in case of disapproval of the nomination paper. The date for withdrawal of the candidature from the election was fixed for 29.07.2012. The final list of the candidates was published on 30.07.2012. The election was duly held on 13.08.2012 and on the basis of the unofficial result, a notice for holding a meeting was issued on 23.08.2012 pursuant to which a meeting comprising of the elected members was held on 28.08.2012 with the agenda for electing the Chairman of the Managing Committee. At the said meeting Mr. Abul Hossain Howlader who was the Chairman of the previous Committee was unanimously elected as the Chairman of the new Managing Committee. Thereafter the headmaster of the school sent the list of the Committee along with their particulars to the respondent no. 3, the Inspector of schools for approval of and for publication of the same in the official notification. While the elected Managing Committee including the petitioner was awaiting approval for the proposal, they came to know of the disapproval of the Committee issued by the respondent no. 3 by a Memo dated 20.12.2012. Thereafter another Memo dated 06.01.2013 was issued by the respondent no. 3 forming an ad hoc committee to run the affairs of the school.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In considering the legality of the impugned decision taken by the respondent no. 3, we have perused and considered the scheme of the Regulations. The relevant provisions of the Regulations are briefly discussed below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">          Regulation 7 provides for procedure of formation of a Managing Committee and regulation 8 prescribes the procedure for electing the President of the Managing Committee of an Educational Institution. Regulation 9 provides for the tenure of the Managing Committee which would be of two years from the date of its first meeting to be held under the provisions of regulation 33. Regulation 26 provides for the procedure of publication of the result of the election of the Managing Committee. Regulation 29(3) relates to, among others, the approval of the Managing Committee of an Educational Institution by the Board. According to the provisions of regulation 29(3) of the Regulations a copy of the election result along with the resolution of a meeting by electing the President of the Managing Committee is required to be sent to the Board for according its approval and the Board in its turn shall publish a notification approving the Managing Committee. Regulation 38 empowers the Board to dissolve the Governing Body or Managing Committee as the case may be on the grounds of inefficiency, mismanagement and financial irregularities etc. Sub-regulation (2) stipulates issuance of a notice giving the members of the Committee an opportunity of being heard prior to a decision of dissolution of such Managing Committee. The Board or the Government is, under no circumstances, empowered to issue any directive to dissolve a proposed Managing Committee formed through a transparent, free and fair election process or to form an ad hoc committee to function as the Managing Committee in place of the elected one. Thus in refusing to give approval of the Managing Committee and the formation of an ad hoc committee the respondent no. 3 has clearly exceeded his authority inasmuch as he has not been empowered to do so under the Regulations. When a list of members of a newly elected Managing Committee along with a resolution of a meeting of such committee selecting or electing a Chairman has been sent to the Board for its approval under the provisions of regulation 29(3) the Board can not but approve the said Committee as a matter of routine. There is no doubt that a Managing Committee can be dissolved upon certain allegations with prior show cause notice in compliance of the provisions of regulation 38.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case, however, when the proposal dated 28.08.2012 was sent to the Board for its approval, after the election of the Managing Committee and the Chairman thereof, the Board kept silent inexplicably for a long period of four months; the petitioner came to know about the decision of disapproval of the Board on 28.12.2012. Our attention has been drawn to an inquiry report dated 28.11.2012, on the basis of which the Board took the decision of disapproval of the Managing Committee. The Inquiry Committee is stated to have found irregularities in sending the names of the newly elected committee to the Board. But we do not find the existence of or any basis for exercise of authority for conducting the inquiry in the first place. The finding that the newly formed Managing Committee and the Chairman thereof were elected under duress was made in the absence of the petitioner or the other elected members. Infact no notice was served upon any of them as to conduct of such inquiry. Therefore, the formation of an ad hoc committee on the basis of such an unilateral inquiry report instead of according approval of the Managing Committee appears to have been taken illegally and the same is a glaring instance of the violation of the principles of natural justice. On our query, the learned Deputy Attorney General failed to show us the authority or the basis of the inquiry held by the 2(two) member Inquiry Committee without informing the petitioner or any of the members. It is further necessary to mention that nowhere in the decision of the Board the question of violation of the Regulations or any irregularity with regard to the process of election of the Managing Committee has been raised. Thus it appears that the decision of the Board in not giving approval of the lawful elected Committee of the educational institution was malafide which had been made arbitrarily and for a collateral purpose. We find serious irregularity committed by the respondent no. 3 and, therefore, we consider it prudent to issue an appropriate direction upon the respondents to give approval of the Managing Committee sent on 28.08.2012 by the respondent no. 5, the headmaster of the school. It is to be noted here that there is a provision in regulation 9 that the tenure of the Managing Committee of an educational institution would be of two years from the date of its first meeting to be held under the provisions of regulation 33 of the Regulations. Therefore, the tenure of the Managing Committee of the school would be 2(two) years from the date of its first meeting to be held after necessary permission of the Board is accorded and the names of the members thereof are published in the official notification.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Having considered the materials on record and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we find substance in the Rule. The Rule, therefore, succeeds.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the result, the Rule is made absolute.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Both the decisions of the respondent no. 3 dated 06.01.2013 and 20.12.2012 (as contained in Annexures- ‘A and A-1’) forming an ad hoc committee and refusing to give approval of the Managing Committee are hereby declared to have been done without lawful authority and of no legal effect.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The respondent no. 3, the Inspector of Schools is directed to issue formal approval of the Managing Committee and publish the same in the official notification within 15(fifteen) days from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         Let a copy of this judgment and order be sent to all of the respondents for compliance.<br/><strong>Ed.</strong></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> </div><hr/><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><strong>Writ Petition No. </strong></a><strong>726 of 2013 </strong></div></div></div></div>

The Petitioner has been properly registered with the VAT and other tax authorities and has been regularly paying all tax including VAT. Its VAT registration number is 5121002196. The Petitioner sells its products at the ex-factory price to the distributors of the said LBBL and transfers products to LBBL’s Depots on payment of VAT. These distributors are the exclusive buyers of the Petitioner. Accordingly, the Petitioner has submitted price declaration as per the ex-factory price in the prescribed forms which were forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner, Customs Excise and VAT, who without accepting the same adopted a back calculation mechanism i.e. levied tax on a base inclusive price arrived at by deducting a deemed value addition of 10% from the retail selling price written on the body of the products.

Section 5(2) of the Act gives a right to manufacturer to declare base value which can be interfered with by the VAT authority as a whole in exercise of power given under rule 3 read with  section 72 of the VAT Act. Section 72 of the Act stated that for the purpose of this Act government may frame Rules. If we glean all these provisions i.e. section  5(2) we find that  the base value declared under section 5(2) can be reduced or enhanced by the authority in terms of rule 3 that is to say that while exercising the power under rule 3, as it has been done in the instant case. While doing so the VAT authority can take into consideration all the variables properly to give a correct decision in terms of the provisions as hinted above.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">As we have found in the decision of <em>Chittagong Cement Clinkers vs NBR</em> Justice Md. Abdur Rashid while dealing with the similar situation observed:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>“In the appeal before the Appellate Tribunal the petitioner stated various facts and circumstances to justify reduction of its price and quantum of profit in order to make the price of its cement competitive in the market and in the interest of business.

Imported raw materials are carried to the factory by conveyor and in such carrying of the raw materials and loading and unloading and transportation, the cost that is incurred is lower than other factories, say, which are situated in Khulna, Narayanganj and Sylhet in the country.”</em></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The decision as cited above was given upon consideration of the entire factor of the market and other aspects, which had bearing for fixing the base value declared by the petitioner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Moreso, in the Case of <em>Shah Cement Industries Limited -vs- Chairman, Customs, Excise and VAT Appeal Tribunal and others</em>  63 DLR - 684 held:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Value Added Tax (xxii of 1991)<br/>Section 5(2)<br/>            “<em>Section 5(2) of the Act gives a right to manufacturer to declare base value which can be interfered with by the VAT authority as a hole in exercise of power given under rule 3 read with  section 72 of the VAT Act.

Their statements are so derogatory and contemptuous that if they  are let off any person will be emboldened to make similar statements/remarks/comments interfering with the administration of justice and also undermining the authority of this Court in the estimation of the people in </strong><strong>general. The prayer for unconditional apology</strong><strong> is, therefore, refused. The contemnors are found guilty of gross contempt of this Court. Since the contemnors have tendered uncon-ditional apology at the earliest opportunity, we are taking a lenient view in awarding the sentence. The contemnors are sentenced to pay fine of Tk.50,000/- (fifty thousand only) each within seven days from date and donate the same to the Islamia Eye  Hospital (Dhaka City), Farmgate, Dhaka and the National Liver Foundation of Bangladesh, 150 Green Road, Panthapath, Dhaka- 1215, in default to suffer simple imprisonment for seven days.”          . . .

The first category is termed as civil contempt, whereas the other two categories are contempt of a criminal nature.                                              . . . (16)</strong><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 7(2), 26 and 102</strong><br/><strong>There is no gainsaying that the judiciary is the guardian of the rule of law. The Supreme Court has been entrusted with the solemn duty of declaring the law and by the same token declaring that any law is ultra vires the Constitution.  It can be concluded that everyone, how high so ever she or he may be, must abide by the law of the land. The law of the land  includes all that is law as defined and accepted as law by the Constitution. Every citizen has surrendered to the  provisions of the Constitution which is the manifestation of the will of the people. There are a multitude of rights given by the Constitution to the citizen, but those are subject to restrictions imposed by law. However, the Constitution has provided for the citizen an independent judiciary which will establish the rule of law.                                                   . . . (18)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 111 and 152</strong><br/><strong>It is indeed a solemn oath and an arduous burden, which has to be borne in spite of the various vulnerabilities of the judges. The judges do not have a voice to air their grievances or to protest any vengeful attacks, verbal or otherwise. They do, however, express their views in their judgments; in particular, they are mandated by the Constitution to say what is or is not the law. Consequently what the Supreme Court declares in its judgement is law, until a judgement of the High Court Division is </strong><strong>reversed or altered by the Appellate Division,</strong><strong> or in the case of a judgment of the Appellate Division, until it is altered upon review or </strong><strong>subsequently overruled by this Division upon</strong><strong> a revisit to the earlier decision. . . . (22)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 93 (1), 102 and 152 (1)</strong><br/><strong>The Supreme Court will declare which of the laws described in the Constitution under article 152(1) or article 93(1) are inconsistent with or, in other words, ultra vires the Constitution. This duty of the Supreme Court is unconditional. In addition, the High Court Division has the power of judicial review as provided by article 102 of the Constitution, which essentially provides  the duty to see that the laws are implemented and that any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, enforces the fundamental rights conferred upon the citizens by the Constitution. On a broader plain, it is the Courts which ensure proper implementation of the laws enacted by  Parliament. . . . (27)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Articles 39 and 108</strong><br/><strong>Any critique of any judgment of any Court is permissible so long as it is within the bounds of objective criticism based on and  </strong><strong>supported by reasoning founded upon existing</strong><strong> laws or decisions of the superior courts. However, personal attacks on individual judges or imputation of improper motives of judges acting in the course of their duty is </strong><strong>not tolerated anywhere in the world. Scurrilous</strong><strong> remarks about judges and scandalisation of the Court are everywhere dealt with under the law contempt of court. Fair criticism of </strong><strong>judgments and decisions based upon objective </strong><strong>critical analysis of the law and other decisions from home and abroad cannot be subject of contempt of court proceedings. However, criticising the integrity of individual judges cuts at the root of the justice delivery system, especially if the allegations are unfounded.          … (31)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 108</strong><br/><strong>Making objectionable remarks against judicial officers may constitute contempt of court. However, it must be noted that criticism of a judgement, that is, the decision itself cannot constitute contempt of court. Similarly, criticism of a judge in his individual capacity, per se, does not constitute contempt of court, unless such criticism goes to the root of the judiciary as an institution. It would certainly be contempt of court if the language used brings the court into disrespect, or impinges upon its dignity and majesty and challenges the efficiency or competence of the judge to dispense justice. It would be contempt of court if the comments published tend to interfere with the administration of justice, especially if the comments relate to a matter which is sub judice. Scandalising the court is not necessarily intended to attack any particular Judge. But it entails publication which, although it does not relate to any specific judge, is a scurrilous attack on the judiciary as a whole, which is calculated to undermine the authority of the courts and public confidence in the administration of justice.          . . . (32 and 34)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 108</strong><br/><strong>Whether or not apology of contemnors is accepted and if so, what sanction if any is to be imposed depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Apologies are mere empty  words if the contemnors in fact justify their action in some way. We have noted that during the course of deliberations on 20th March the Court observed that usually if apology is offered then it is normally in one or two sentences. When the contemnors say sorry and then proceed to justify why they   said what they had said, then the apology is a mere device to get a lesser punishment or no punishment at all. This Court has a duty to protect itself and the judicial institution   from any person who will utter damaging remarks and then proffer empty apologies when taken to task for their admitted acts of destruction and desecration of the sanctity of the judiciary, which is otherwise held in high esteem by the general public.                                               . . .

What they say in public  is listened to by the masses. They are respected by the  public at large for the positions they </strong><strong>hold. They represent the people in Parliament</strong><strong> and the general public look up to them. Anything they say is bound to have an effect on the minds of the public at large. When Ministers make utterances denigrating the Chief Justice and question the impartiality of the justice delivery system, which they do by doubting the impartiality of the Chief Justice, then the whole judiciary  is brought to disrepute. . (53)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 108</strong><br/><strong>The [contempt] jurisdiction is not exercised to protect the dignity of an individual judge but to protect the administration of justice from being maligned. Interference with the administration of justice, which may have the tendency to pervert the course of justice, has been termed as a serious type of contempt. . . . (57)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Words and Phrases</strong><br/><strong>Rule of Law</strong><br/><strong><em>Per Mr. Hasan Foes Siddique, J, giving separate opinion:</em></strong><br/><strong>Rule of Law is the basic rule of governance of any civilized democratic policy. Our constitutional scheme is based upon the concept of “Rule of Law” which we have adopted and given to ourselves. Everyone, whether individually or collectively is unquestionably under the supremacy of    law. Whoever the person may be, however high he or she is, no-one is above the law notwithstanding how powerful and how rich he or she may be. Even the Supreme Court is subordinate to the law and not above the law. For achieving the establishment of the rule of law, the Constitution has assigned the special task to the judiciary in the country. It is only through the Courts that the rule of law unfolds its contents and establishes its concept. For the judiciary to perform its duties and functions effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly entrusted, the dignity and authority of the Courts have to be respected and protected at all costs. The only weapon of protecting itself from onslaught to the institution is the long hand of contempt of court left in the armoury of judicial repository which, when needed, can reach any neck howsoever or far away it may be. Judiciary is central pillar of democracy.        . . . (80)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 108</strong><br/><strong>When contempt is committed in the face of the Supreme Court to scandalise or humiliate the Court and the Judge, instant action may be necessary. If the courts do not deal with such contempt with strong hand, </strong><strong>that may result in scandalising the institution</strong><strong> thereby lowering its dignity in the eyes of the public. The courts exist for the people. The courts charished the faith reposed in them by people. To prevent erosion of that faith, contempt committed in the face of the court needs a strict treatment.           . . . (81)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 108</strong><br/><strong>It is only through the Courts that rule of law unfolds its contours and establishes its concept. For the judiciary  to carry out its obligations effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly entrusted the task, constitutional Courts have been given the power to punish for contempt, but greater the power; higher the responsibility.       . . .(95)</strong><br/><br/><strong>Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972</strong><br/><strong>Article 108</strong><br/><strong>We have convicted and sentenced the contemners to set an example and to give caution to all that it has become fashion to criticise the Judges for no fault of them.  But the observation as to breach of oath of office is not in consonance with the notice issued upon the contemners.

These comments   <em>prima   facie   </em>appeared   derogatory   and highly contemptuous, and hence this Court issued the following notice on 8th March, 2016:<br/>“Let a notice issue calling upon Advocate Md. Qamrul Islam, M.P., Minister, Ministry of Food, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and Mr. A.K.M. Mozammel Huq, M.P., Minister, Ministry of Liberation War Affairs, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh to show cause on or  before 14th March, 2016 as to why they shall not be proceeded against for their derogatory and highly contemptuous statements made on 5th March, 2016, at a roundtable discussion held  at  BILIA Auditorium, Dhanmondi, Dhaka,  which were broadcast and published in different electronic and print media, against the Chief Justice of Bangladesh  and  the Supreme Court in relation to a judgement to be pronounced in  a criminal appeal on 8<sup>th</sup> March, 2016. The statements and the comments are flagrant interference with the administration of Justice, questioning the independence of the judiciary. Such statements and comments have undermined the dignity, prestige and authority and impartiality of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and the office of the Chief Justice in the estimation of the public at large.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">You are hereby directed to appear in person on 15<sup>th</sup> March, 2016 at 9:00 A.M. before this Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The offending portion of the statements published in an issue of the Daily Jugantor, one of the national dailies dated 6<sup>th</sup> March, 2016, is enclosed herewith.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the date fixed for their appearance, contemnor- respondent No. 2, A.K.M. Mozammel Huq (hereinafter referred to as respondent No. 2) appeared in person along with his  learned Counsel, whereas contemnor-respondent No.1, Advocate Md. Qamrul Islam (hereinafter referred to as respondent No. 1) filed an application through his learned Counsel praying for an adjournment. On such prayer, the matter was adjourned to 20th March, 2016 with a direction that the contemnors shall appear in person on that date at 9:00 A.M. before this Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On 20<sup>th</sup> March, 2016 both the contemnors appeared in person along with their learned Counsel. Their respective affidavits were placed before the Court. It is noted that both the contemnors admitted having made the statements-the subject matter of the contempt proceedings. They both explained the reasons for making such statements and their sentiments being Muktijoddhas. They expressed their regrets and prayed for acceptance of their apology. Some deliberation took place and, thereafter on the prayer of the learned Counsel for respondent No. 1 the matter was adjourned to 27<sup>th</sup> March, 2016 with a direction that the contemnors shall appear in person on that date at 9:00 A.M. before this Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The matter was heard again on 27th of March, 2016 when both the contemnors were present in Court and their respective Counsel placed the affidavits on behalf of the respondents expressing unconditional apology. After due consideration and deliberation, the Court disposed of the matter upon passing the following order:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“For the reasons to be stated later on, we make this short order. We have perused the applications filed by the contemnors offering unconditional apology with a prayer for exonerating them from the charge of contempt of this   Court.<br/>We are unable to accept the unconditional apology offered by the contemnors taking into consideration that the contemnors are sitting Cabinet Ministers holding constitutional posts. They are oath bound to preserve and protect the Constitution. The impugned statements/comments/remarks made by them apparently show that they made those comments intentionally with the object of maligning and undermining the office of  the Chief Justice and the highest Court of the country. Their statements are so derogatory and contemptuous that if they  are let off any person will be emboldened to make similar statements/remarks/comments interfering with the administration of justice and also undermining the authority of this Court in the estimation of the people in general. The prayer for unconditional apology is, therefore, refused. The contemnors are found guilty of gross contempt of this Court.<br/>Since the contemnors have tendered unconditional apology at the earliest opportunity, we are taking a lenient view in awarding the sentence. The contemnors are sentenced to pay fine of Tk.50,000/- (fifty thousand only) each within seven days from date and donate the same to the Islamia Eye  Hospital (Dhaka City), Farmgate, Dhaka and the National Liver Foundation of Bangladesh, 150 Green Road, Panthapath, Dhaka- 1215, in default to suffer simple imprisonment for seven days.”<br/><strong>Comments/remarks/statements made by the contemnors:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The facts leading up to the issuance of the show cause notice against the respondents herein are as follows: Mir Kashem Ali, who was alleged to have committed crimes during the war of liberation, had been tried and convicted by the International Crimes Tribunal, hereinafter referred to as  “the ICT”, and sentenced to death. He preferred appeal before this Division of the Supreme Court. After a lengthy hearing of the criminal appeal, 8<sup>th</sup> of March, 2016 was fixed for pronouncement of judgement. It was reported in the Daily Jugantor on 6<sup>th</sup> March, 2016 that on the previous day two Cabinet Ministers, namely Advocate Md. Qamrul Islam, Minister, Ministry of Food and Advocate A.K.M. Mozammel Huq, Minister, Ministry of Liberation War Affairs had made certain comments at a Roundtable meeting organised by the <em>Ghatok Dalal Nirmul Committee </em>held at the BILIA Auditorium in Dhanmondi. Details of their speeches were published in many of the national dailies, both in English and in Bangla. A copy of the Daily Jugantor, one of the national dailies dated 6<sup>th</sup> March, 2016, was enclosed with the notice issued and served upon the respondents. It is reported that respondent No. 1 uttered that since the Chief Justice has said that the International Crimes Tribunal is being used politically, then the case of Mir Kashem Ali should be tried by a new Bench leaving out the Chief Justice. Since the Chief Justice has made comments about the case in open Court, the appeal should be heard again without the Chief Justice because whatever decision he gives, it will be questionable. He also said that the Chief Justice wanted to put the prosecution –  investigation team in the dock along with the accused and   that the prosecution/Government is doing politics with this case. Such statement in open Court led him to guess that the decision would go against the Muktijoddhas. Since the Chief Justice had made such statements, there is no way that the accused will be sentenced to death and that he will either acquit the accused, or reduce the sentence or send the case  on remand for fresh trial. In the same meeting respondent No. 2 said that if the death sentence is upheld then it will be said that the Government created pressure and if, on the  other hand, the decision is otherwise, whether it will be acceptable, and this dilemma has been created by the Chief Justice.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We are to consider whether such utterances by the two respondents has scandalised the Court thus constituting contempt, in this case, of this Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and whether such utterances in public by two sitting Ministers of the Government has violated any provisions of the Constitution in view of their oath of office.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Salient features of the Constitution relevant to the case in hand:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and any law inconsistent with it shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void [Art.7]. Ours is a democratic Republic [Art.11]. The citizens of this country are governed by the rule of law [Art.27] and enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, and only in accordance with law [Art.31]. The Constitution has entrusted and empowered the Supreme Court to protect and uphold the rule of law, which is the <em>sine qua non </em>of any democratic society, and has granted power of judicial review of actions of any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic…. [for] the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights [Art.102].  More specifically, the Supreme Court has been given the authority by the Constitution to declare law. The law declared by the Appellate Division is binding on the High Court Division and the law declared by either Division of the Supreme Court is binding on the subordinate judiciary [Art.111].All authorities, executive and judicial, in the Republic shall act in aid of the Supreme Court [112]. It is the duty of every citizen to observe the Constitution and the laws, to maintain discipline, to perform public duties and to protect public property [Art. 21(1)].</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For the purpose of the instant case, the most relevant provision of the Constitution is that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power subject to law to make an order for the investigation of or punishment for any contempt of itself [Art.108].</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         Contempt of Court:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the recent past there have been several decisions of this Division regarding contempt of court where all the relevant aspects have been dealt with in detail upon discussion of a plethora of citations of cases decided by the superior courts from home and abroad. Reference may be made to decisions of this Division in the case of <strong><em>Md. Riaz Uddin Khan, Advocate and another vs Mahmudur Rahman and others </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>63 DLR (AD) 29 </em></strong>and in the case of <strong><em>The State –Vs- Mr. Swadesh Roy, (author of the article under the caption “</em></strong><strong><em>সাকার পরিবা­রর ততপরতাz পালাবার পথ </em></strong><strong><em>K‡g †M‡Q</em></strong><strong><em>”  in  the  issue  of  The  Daily  Janakantha”  and another </em></strong>reported in <strong><em>12 ADC (2015) 932</em></strong>. Numerous decisions have been cited from across the globe as well as many citations from renowned treatise. Hence, lengthy discussion into the juristic aspects of contempt of court is felt superfluous  here.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Broadly speaking, contempt of court may be classified into three categories, namely (1) disobedience of court orders and breach of undertakings given to the court, (2) scandalisation of the court and (3) interference with the administration of justice. The first category is termed as civil contempt, whereas the other two categories are contempt of a criminal nature. In the facts and circumstances of the instant case, we are not concerned with the first category since there is no allegation of any breach or non-compliance by the contemnors-respondents of any order issued by this Court. The question to be considered is whether the respondents have made comments/ remarks which scandalise the Court or which interfere with the administration of justice.  It is also pertinent to pose the question whether such utterances in public, by persons holding high constitutional posts has demonstrated their utter disregard for the rule of law and decisions of the Supreme Court and hence violation of the provisions of the Constitution contrary to the oath of their office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>         The Rule of Law</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution gives much importance to the rule of law. The Preamble to the Constitution provides that we the people of Bangladesh pledge that it shall be a fundamental aim of our State to realise through the democratic process a socialist society free from exploitation where there will be rule of law for all citizens. The paramount need for the rule of law is reiterated in the body of the Constitution. Recognising that the rule of law is the foundation of a democratic society, our Constitution has given due importance to it in several articles, and it has been accepted as one of the basic structures of the Constitution. Every citizen, whatever his rank or status, is subject to the laws of the land and to the jurisdiction of the courts. Without rule of law there would be anarchy.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">There is no gainsaying that the judiciary is the guardian of the rule of law. The Supreme Court has been entrusted with the solemn duty of declaring the law and by the same token declaring that any law is <em>ultra vires </em>the Constitution. In the case of <strong><em>Bangladesh v. Idrisur Rahman, (2010) 15 BLC (AD) 49 </em></strong>at p. 94 it was observed that “The expression of rule of law has a number of different meanings and corollaries. Its primary meaning is that everything must be done in accordance with law, in other words, it speaks of rule of law and not of men and everybody is under the law and nobody is above the law.  The other meaning of the rule of law is that Government should be conducted within a framework of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power and our Constitution is the embodiment of the supreme will of the people setting forth the rules and principles. But the most important meaning of rule of law is that the disputes as to the legality of the acts of the Government are to be decided by Judges who are independent of the executive”. Hence, it can be concluded that everyone, how high so ever she or he may be, must abide by the law of the land. The law of the land includes all that is law as defined and accepted as law by the Constitution. Every citizen has surrendered to the provisions of the Constitution which is the manifestation of the will of the people. There are a multitude of rights given by the Constitution to the citizen, but those are subject to restrictions imposed by law. However, the Constitution has provided for the citizen an independent judiciary which will establish the rule of law. It was held in the case of <strong><em>Md Idrisur Rahman </em></strong>cited above as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The judiciary is a cornerstone of our Constitution, playing a vital role in upholding the rule of law”.   Per M.A. Matin, J<strong>. </strong>at p. 88.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mahmudul Islam has in his book “Constitutional Law of Bangladesh” third edition, at paragraph 1.28A noted, “For guardianship of the Constitution and for the establishment of rule of law independence of judiciary is necessary.” In this regard reference may be made to articles 94(4) and 116A.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Independence of the judiciary</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court, which has been given the power of judicial review, is the guardian of the Constitution. In order to be effective in its capacity as guardian and for the establishment of rule of law, independence of the judiciary is imperative.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It was held in the case of <strong><em>Secretary, Ministry of Finance vs. Md. Masdar Hossain, 52 DLR(AD)82 </em></strong>“The independence of the judiciary as affirmed and declared by Article 94(4) and 116A, is one of the basic pillars of the Constitution and cannot be demolished, whittled down, curtailed or diminished in any manner whatsoever, except under the existing provision of the Constitution.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Judges must act true to their oath of office, which they swear or affirm on taking office: “That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of  Bangladesh: And that I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill- will.”It is indeed a solemn oath and an arduous burden, which has to be borne in spite of the various vulnerabilities of the judges. The judges do not have a voice to air their grievances or to protest any vengeful attacks, verbal or otherwise. They do, however, express their views in their judgements; in particular, they are mandated by the Constitution to say what is or is not the law. Consequently what the Supreme Court declares in its judgement is law, until a judgement of the  High Court Division is reversed or altered by the Appellate Division, or in the case of a judgement of the Appellate Division, until it is altered upon review or subsequently overruled by this Division upon a revisit to the earlier decision.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Definition of law:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">"Law" means every law pronounced as such by the Constitution of Bangladesh. The Constitution itself is  declared by article 7(2) to be the supreme law of the  Republic, and any other law inconsistent with the Constitution is void. Further, 'law' is defined in article 152(1) of the Constitution as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">"law" means any Act, ordinance, order, rule, regulation, by-law, notification or other legal instrument, and any custom or usage, having the force of law in Bangladesh".<br/>However, it has to be noted that this definition is not exhaustive. Article 152(1) begins in this way: “In this Constitution, except where the subject or context otherwise requires- .….” Hence, there are other laws  mentioned elsewhere in the Constitution recognised as ‘law’ by the Constitution.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Ordinances made and promulgated by the President when Parliament is dissolved or not in session also have the like force of law as an Act of Parliament, as provided by article 93(1) of the Constitution. Such law-making power of the President is restricted by the proviso to article 93(1).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution also gives the Supreme Court of Bangladesh the power to declare what are laws within the territory of Bangladesh. Article 111 provides that the ‘law’ declared by the Appellate Division shall be binding on the  High Court Division and the law declared by either Division of the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts subordinate  to it.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Law making power</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Parliament has the power to enact any law, and it does so as the mandate of the electorate and for the benefit of the citizens of the country. However, that power of Parliament is circumscribed to the extent that the laws so enacted shall not be inconsistent with the Constitution. Apart from article 7(2), article 26(1) of the Constitution provides that all existing law inconsistent with Part III of the Constitution shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, become void on the commencement of the Constitution. Under article 26(2) any law to be enacted by Parliament shall not be inconsistent with Part III of the Constitution.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The duty then falls upon the Supreme Court to declare what are valid laws, that is to say, the Supreme Court will declare which of the laws described in the Constitution under article 152(1) or article 93(1) are inconsistent with or, in other words, <em>ultra vires </em>the Constitution. This duty of the Supreme Court is unconditional. In addition, the High Court Division has the power of judicial review as provided by article 102 of the Constitution, which essentially provides the duty to see that the laws are implemented and that any person or authority, including any person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic, enforces the fundamental rights conferred upon the citizens by the Constitution. On a broader plain, it is the Courts which ensure proper implementation of the laws enacted by Parliament.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Thus, a specific duty is cast upon the Supreme Court to ensure that laws are consistent with the Constitution. The High Court Division is entrusted to ensure that persons performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic are doing so in accordance with the provisions of the relevant laws and the Constitution. The rulings of the Supreme Court are law requiring abidance by all citizens.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proceedings and decisions of the Courts and freedom of speech of citizens:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right  of every citizen and is guaranteed under article 39(2)(a) of the Constitution, which provides as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">”(2) Subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by  law in the interests of the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence-</div><ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"><li style="text-align: justify;">the right of every citizen to freedom of speech and expression………are guaranteed”.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus the freedom of speech and expression in article 39(2)(a) is circumscribed by the limitation expressed in sub- article (2) of article 39.</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Hence, it is permissible for a citizen to express his or her views, but that freedom to do so is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law, <em>inter alia, </em>in relation to contempt of court. As observed by Lord Atkin in <strong><em>Andre P.R. Ambard v. Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago [1936] AC 322</em></strong>,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The path of criticism is a public way: the wrong-headed are permitted to err therein: provided that members of  the public abstain from imputing improper motives to  those taking part in the administration of justice, and are genuinely exercising a right of criticism, and not acting in malice or attempting to impair the administration of justice.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It may be stated quite categorically that any critique of any judgement of any Court is permissible so long as it is within the bounds of objective criticism based on and  supported by reasoning founded upon existing laws or decisions of the superior courts. However, personal attacks on  individual judges or imputation of improper motives of judges acting in the course of their duty is not tolerated anywhere  in the world. Scurrilous remarks about judges and scandalisation of the Court are everywhere dealt with under  the law contempt of court. Fair criticism of judgements and decisions based upon objective critical analysis of the law  and other decisions from home and abroad cannot be subject of contempt of court proceedings. However, criticising the integrity of individual judges cuts at the root of the justice delivery system, especially if the allegations are unfounded.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scandalisation of the court</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Mahmudul Islam in his treatise <em>Constitutional Law of Bangladesh </em>[Third edition paragraph 5.225] has noted that, “Insinuations and comments derogatory to the dignity of the court which are calculated to undermine the confidence of the people in the integrity of the Judges constitute contempt.” He goes on to say that for the protection of organised society and maintainers of the rule of law there is necessity of independent and fearless judiciary in which the public will have full confidence as dispenser of justice. Making objectionable remarks against judicial officers may constitute contempt of court. However, it must be noted that criticism of a judgement, that is, the decision itself cannot constitute contempt of court. Similarly, criticism of a judge in his individual capacity, <em>per se</em>, does not constitute contempt of court, unless such criticism goes to the root of the judiciary as an institution. It would certainly be contempt of court if the language used brings the court into disrespect, or impinges upon its dignity and majesty and challenges the efficiency or competence of the judge to dispense justice. It would be contempt of court if the comments published tend to interfere with the administration of justice, especially if the comments relate to a matter which is <em>sub judice</em>. About the power of the Court to punish for contempt of Court, Mahmudul Islam suggests that, “This power has been granted not for the protection of the individual judges from imputations, but for the protection of the public themselves from the mischief they will incur if the authority of the Supreme Court is impaired.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Moazzem Hossain, Deputy Attorney General vs. The State, 1983 3 BLD (AD) 251</em></strong>, it was observed,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   "’Contempt’ may be constituted by any conduct that brings authority of the Court into disrespect or disregard or undermines its dignity and prestige. Scandalizing the Court is a worst kind of contempt.  Making imputations touching the impartiality and  integrity of a Judge or making sarcastic remarks about  his judicial competence is also a contempt. Conduct or action causing obstruction or interfering with the course of justice is a contempt. To prejudice the general public against a party to an action before it is heard is  another form of contempt.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Scandalising the court is not necessarily intended to attack any particular Judge. But it entails publication  which, although it does not relate to any specific judge, is  a scurrilous attack on the judiciary as  a whole, which is calculated         to undermine the authority of the courts and public confidence in the administration of justice.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The primary rationale for this form of contempt law is the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice. In the early case of <strong><em>Reg. v. Almon, 1765 Wilm. 243, </em></strong>Wilmot J. stated:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“[the arraignment of the justice of the Judges] excites in the minds of the people a general dissatisfaction  with all judicial determinations and indisposes their minds to obey them; and whenever men’s allegiance to the laws is so fundamentally shaken, it is the most fatal  and most dangerous obstruction of justice, and, in my opinion, calls out for a more rapid and immediate  redress than any other obstruction whatsoever; not for the sake of the Judges, as private individuals, but because they are the channels by which the King’s  Justice is conveyed to the people.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In a similar fashion, the Judges of the Supreme Court convey to the people what the law is and whether any Act of Parliament is <em>ultra vires </em>the Constitution, or action of any public authority or person performing any function in connection with the affairs of the Republic is contrary to law or violates any fundamental rights of a citizen.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Status of the Supreme Court and its power regarding contempt:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court is one of the pillars of the State machinery and afforded the dignity and respect by everyone, even the high and mighty: and rightly so. Daily thousands of litigants throng before the Courts in search of justice. They believe in and respect the justice delivery system. Without such reverence the judgements delivered would be ineffective and the rule of law would be rendered nugatory. Citizens of the country look to the judiciary for adjudication of their legal disputes with their neighbours as well as for enforcement of their rights enshrined in the Constitution and other laws of the land. However, if the judiciary is to perform its duties and functions effectively, to live up to  the expectations of the citizens of the country and remain  true to the spirit with which they are sacredly entrusted, the dignity and authority of the Courts have to be respected and protected by all and at all costs. The Judges are the final arbiter between litigants and between the public and powerful authorities and organisations. The general public always have and always will repose their faith in the justice delivery system so long as the independence and integrity of the judges is seen to be intact. For the judiciary to command the respect of the people, it is necessary that the authority of the Courts and the Judges is not undermined in any way.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In a judgement of the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe <strong><em>In Re: Patrick Anthony Chinamasa</em></strong>, <em>S.C. 113/2000, 6 November 2000, p. 24, </em>Gubbay CJ stated as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Unlike other public figures, judges have no proper   forum in which to reply to criticisms. They cannot debate the issue in public without jeopardizing their impartiality. This is why protection should be given to judges when it is not given to other important members of society such as politicians, administrators  and public servants.”<br/>         The power of the Supreme Court in the matter of exposition of the law is thus unparalleled. In addition to the powers described above, the Appellate Division has the mandate to express opinion on any question of law of public importance referred to it by the President under article 106 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has also been given the power to make rules for regulating its own practice and procedure [Art.107].</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In aid of all its powers given under the Constitution, in order to ensure the authoritative status of the Supreme Court, the Constitution provides in article 112 that all authorities, executive and judicial, in the Republic shall act in aid of the Supreme Court.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is generally accepted that for the sake of maintaining proper order and to ensure compliance of the directions given in judgements, the courts have an inherent power to punish any person or authority for contempt. The Supreme Court has been given specific power by the Constitution to punish for its contempt. Article 108 of the Constitution provides as follows: “108. The Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power subject to law to make an order for the investigation of or punishment for any contempt of itself.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It was observed in the case of <strong><em>Sir Edward Snelson, K.B.E., Secretary to the Govt. of Pakistan, Ministry of Law vs. The Judges of the High Court of West Pakistan, Lahore, 16 DLR(SC) 535, at p.552, per Cornelius, CJ-</em></strong></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “The power of committal for contempt is given to such superior Courts in order that they may swiftly and summarily perform one of their most important duties which is to protect themselves against wilful disregard or disobedience of their authority by visiting with prompt punishment and conduct which tends to bring their authority and the administration of Justice into scorn  or disregard. It is evident that a Court of justice  which has no power to vindicate its dignity or which having the power fails to perform the duty of  vindicating its dignity would swiftly lose all hold upon the public respect and in consequence the maintenance of law and order through the agency of the Courts of  justice would be rendered impossible. The dignity and authority of the Courts has a link with the supremacy  and majesty of the law. Any conduct which is calculated to diminish that dignity or authority is a criminal contempt which a Court is under duty to punish. The Courts of justice are the creation of a sovereign authority, but their mainstay rests in the public confidence, and anything which is calculated to withdraw the public confidence from them has the character of a libel to be visited by action in contempt.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the same case<strong>, <em>per </em>Hamoodur Rahman, J. </strong>at p.593.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “I, for my part, have always taken the view that the power to commit for contempt given to the Courts of  record is a power which should be used sparingly and only in extreme cases, not so much for upholding the dignity  of the Judges who preside over such Courts of justice but rather to preserve  the  dignity  and  respect  due  to the Court itself. But this does not, in my view, mean  that the  species of contempt known as  scandalising  the Courts is now obsolete or that unless there is some kind of actual obstruction to, or interference with, the course of justice or the due administration thereof,  there cannot be any contempt. Any doubt that there may have been cast on this question has been set at rest by the decision of the Queens Bench Division of England in the case of The Queen v. Gray (1900) 2 QBD 36 which was cited with approval by the Privy Council in Ambard v. Attorney-General for Trinidad and Tobago (1936) AC 322. Thus utterances made or writings published, which have the tendency of bringing the Court or a Judge of the Court into contempt or to lower its authority, is a contempt of Court and should not be tolerated, for, it is essential to the proper administration of justice itself that unwarranted attacks should not be made with impunity upon persons presiding over such Courts in respect of their public or official acts.<br/>         From what I have said above it will be observed that I am inclined to accede to the proposition that  criticisms of conducts of Judges, which cannot possibly have the tendency to obstruct or interfere with the administration of justice, are not contempts of Courts, even though they may be libellous attacks on Judges. Thus an attack on a Judge for conduct not connected with his judicial functions will not come within the mischief of   a contempt of Court [vide In the matter of Special Reference from the Bahama Islands 1893 AC 138]. But I  cannot stretch this to attacks on Judges in their public capacity, for, to my mind, such an attack would  inevitably also be calculated to lower the authority of the Courts over which the Judges so maligned happen to be presiding and thus tend to interfere with the due course of justice and the proper administration thereof.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the same case <strong>Fazle-Akber, J </strong>quoting from <strong><em>King v.  Almon </em></strong><em>cited above, </em>concluded that “all the authorities, therefore, tend to show that to taint the source of justice is a contempt of the highest order.” <strong>B.Z. Kaikaus, J. </strong>At p<strong>.</strong>582<strong>, </strong>identified the contempt in that case as one scandalising the Court and observed as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">   “In the present case we are concerned with the third kind of contempt. It is committed if there is imputed to the Judges any unfitness, whether on account of incompetence, lack of integrity or otherwise. The essence of this kind of contempt is that it lowers the dignity of the Court. That which lowers the dignity of Court is an obstruction to the normal course of justice. The Judges cannot perform their duty properly if they are exposed to libellous attacks. It is necessary as stated by Wilmot J. “to keep a blaze of glory around them and to deter people from attempting to render them contemptible in the eyes of the public.” At the same time, it is essential that the confidence of the public in the Courts be maintained.<br/>   In order that the words may constitute contempt it is not necessary that they should in fact interfere with the course of justice. All that is needed is that they should have a tendency to do so. It will be impossible to show in any particular case that the contempt did    have the effect of obstructing the course of justice. On the other hand, the presumption would be to the contrary, for Judges are presumed not to be affected by any  publications constituting contempt. But if this argument were allowed to hold there may never be any committal   for contempt. In a case where a Judge or Court was scandalized, because of the mere existence of a tendency to obstruct the course of justice the jurisdiction to commit in contempt would be invoked.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Supreme Court Bar Association v. Union of India and another, (1984) 4 SCC 409 </em></strong><em>it </em>was observed as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The contempt of court is a special jurisdiction to be exercised sparingly and with caution whenever an act adversely affects the administration of justice or which tends to impede its course or tends to shake public confidence in the judicial institutions. This  jurisdiction may also be exercised when the act  complained of adversely affects the majesty of law or dignity of the courts. The purpose of contempt jurisdiction is to uphold the majesty and dignity of the courts of law….. [This] jurisdiction is not exercised to protect the dignity of an individual judge but to protect the administration of Justice from being maligned. In the general interest of the community it is imperative that the authority of courts should not be imperilled and there should be no unjustifiable interference in the administration of Justice….. [It] is exercised in a summary manner in aid of the administration of  Justice, the majesty of law and the dignity of the courts. No such act can be permitted which may have the tendency to shake the public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the administration of Justice.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In a Full Bench decision, <strong>In re K.L. Gauba, Barrister- at-Law, Lahore </strong>it was observed that, “Any attempt to justify the libel is, in law, a fresh contempt” [AIR 1942 Lah 105] This was reiterated by Cornelius CJ in Sir Edward Snelson’s case as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“As I have observed earlier, in an ordinary case of libel, it is a complete defence that the defamatory imputation is true, but it is otherwise in a case of contempt by scandalizing a Judge or a Court. Any attempt to justify the libel upon a Judge or a Court is in itself a fresh contempt.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It has long been accepted and oft quoted that the extraordinary power of punishment for contempt has been given to the courts in order to “keep a blaze of glory around them and to deter people from attempting to render them  contemptible in the eyes of the public”. No one should  consider himself so high and mighty that he can utter such words as give offence to any Court in such a way that the  Court feels lowered in the estimation of the people. Such action of any person would be a matter of great regret.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Riaz Uddin Khan, Advocate v. Mahmudur Rahman and others, 63 DLR(AD) (2011) 29</em></strong>, SK Sinha J, as his Lordship was then, referred to the decision of the Indian Supreme Court as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“Reference may be made to another decision of the Supreme Court in <strong><em>MB Sanghi (MB Sanghi vs. High Court of Punjab  and Haryana, AIR 1991 SC), </em></strong>in which AM Ahmadi, J while agreeing with the views with SC Agrawal, J added that the tendency of maligning the reputation of Judicial Officers by disgruntled elements who fail to secure the desired order is ever on the increase and it is high time it is nipped in the bud. And, when a member of the profession resorts to such cheap gimmicks with a view to browbeating the judge into submission, it is all the more painful. When there is a deliberate attempt to scandalise which would shake the confidence of the litigating public in the system, the damage caused is not only to the reputation of the concerned judge but also to be fair name of the judiciary. Veiled threats, abrasive behaviour, use of disrespectful language and at times blatant condemnatory attacks like the present one are often designedly employed with a view to taming a judge into submission to secure a desired order. Such cases raise larger issues touching the independence of not only the concerned judge but the entire institution. The foundation of our system which is based on the independence and impartiality of those who man it will be shaken if disparaging and derogatory remarks are made against the Presiding Judicial Officers with impunity. Learned Judge concluded his speech with the following words:<br/>It is high time it is realised that the much cherished judicial independence has to be protected not only from the executive or the legislature but also from those who are an integral part of the system.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the Australian case of <strong><em>Gallagher v. Durack, [1983] 152 CLR 238</em></strong>, a trade union leader had been found in contempt for making the following statement about an earlier acquittal for contempt:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“I’m very happy to [sic] the rank and file of the union who has shown such fine support for the officials of the union… by their actions in demonstrating in walking off jobs…. I believe that has been the main reason for the court changing its mind.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The High Court of Australia rejected his appeal on the basis that his statement had the tendency to undermine confidence in the administration of justice:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The statement by the applicant that he believed that the actions of the rank and file of the Federation had been the main reason for the court changing its mind can only mean that he believed that the court was largely influenced in reaching its decision by the action of the members of the union in demonstrating as they had done. In other words, the applicant was insinuating that the Federal Court had bowed to outside pressure in reaching its decision…. What was imputed was a grave breach of duty by the court. The imputation was of course unwarranted.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">The Australian court observed that an attack against the vital institution threatens to undermine the rule of law because the respect for the rule of law and compliance with the orders of the courts depends on the confidence of the public on the administration of justice, the Courts and the justice delivery system as a whole. The law of contempt serves the overriding public interest in protecting the administration of justice. The protection of the Courts from the onslaught of individual denigration ensures the continuance of the rule of law which is fundamental for the existence of democracy and for the protection of human rights and rights of the citizens.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Effect of apology by contemnors:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Whether or not apology of contemnors is accepted and if so, what sanction if any is to be imposed depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Apologies are mere empty words if the contemnors in fact justify their action in some way. We have noted that during the course of deliberations on 20th March the Court observed that usually if apology is offered then it is normally in one or two sentences. When the contemnors say sorry and then proceed to justify why they   said what they had said, then the apology is a mere device to get a lesser punishment or no punishment at all. This Court has a duty to protect itself and the judicial institution   from any person who will utter damaging remarks and then proffer empty apologies when taken to task for their admitted acts of destruction and desecration of the sanctity of the judiciary, which is otherwise held in high esteem by the general public.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In the case of S.P. Gupta vs. President of India and Ors. </strong>AIR1982SC149, it was observed as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“In securing and promoting the resolution of disputes in a legal forum in accordance with established legal procedure, the administration of justice ensures a peaceful and orderly progress by a people through constitutional methods towards the realisation of their aspirations. And if it is to rule their minds and   hearts, the administration of justice must enjoy their confidence. Public confidence in the administration of justice is imperative to its effectiveness, because ultimately the ready acceptance of a judicial verdict alone gives relevance to the judicial system. While the administration of justice draws its legal sanction from the Constitution, its credibility rests in the faith of the people. Indispensable to that faith is the independence of the judiciary. An independent and impartial judiciary supplies the reason for the judicial institution, it also gives character and content to the constitutional milieu.<br/>It is high time that we realise that the much cherished judicial independence has to be protected not only from the executive or the legislature but also from those who are an integral part of the system. An independent judiciary is of vital importance to any free society. Judicial independence was not achieved overnight. Since we have inherited this concept from the British, it  would not be out of place to mention the struggle strong-willed judges like Sir Edward Coke, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and many others had to put up with the Crown as well as the Parliament at considerable personal risk. And when a member of the profession  like the appellant who should know better so lightly trifles with the much endeared concept of judicial independence  to secure small gains it only betrays a lack of respect for the martyrs of judicial independence and for the institution itself. Their sacrifice would go waste if we are not jealous to protect the fair name of  the judiciary from unwarranted attacks on its independence. And here is a member of the profession who has repeated his performance presumable because he was let  off lightly on the first occasion. Soft-justice is not the answer-not that the High Court has been harsh with him- what I mean is he cannot be let off on an apology which is far from sincere. His apology was hollow, there was  no remorse-no regret-it was only a device to escape the rigour of the law. What he said in his affidavit was  that he had not uttered the words attributed to him by the learned Judge; in other words the learned judge was lying-adding insult to injury-and yet if the court finds him guilty (he contested the matter tooth and nail) his unqualified apology may be accepted. This is no apology, it is merely a device to escape. The High Court rightly did not accept it. That is what this Court had done in a similar situation in <strong><em>L.D. Jaikwal v. State of U.P., 1984 CriLJ 993. </em></strong>This Court described it as a ‘paper’ apology and refused to accept it in the following words:<br/>“We do not think that merely because the appellant has tendered his apology we should set aside the sentence and allow him to go unpunished. Otherwise, all that a person wanting to intimidate a Judge by making the grossest imputations against him has to do, is to go ahead and scandalize him, and later on tender a formal empty apology which costs him practically nothing. If such an apology were to be accepted, as a rule, and not as an exception, we would in fact be virtually issuing a ‘licence’ to scandalize courts and commit contempt of court with impunity. It will be rather difficult to persuade members of the Bar, who care for their  self- respect, to join the judiciary if they are expected to pay such a price for it. And no sitting judge will feel free to decide any matter as per the dictates of his conscience on account of fear of being scandalized and persecuted by an advocate who does not mind making reckless allegations if the Judge goes against his wishes. If this situation were to be countenanced, advocates who can cow down the Judges, and make them fall in line with their wishes, by threats of character assassination and persecution, will be preferred by the litigants to the advocates who are mindful of  professional ethics and  believe  in  maintaining  the  decorum of courts.”<br/>As <strong>M. Hidayatullah, C.J. </strong>observed in <strong>E.M. Sankaran Namboodripad Vs. T. Narayanan Nambiar, </strong>(1970) 2 SCC325,<br/>“The good faith of the judges is the firm bed-rock on which any system of administration securely rests and attempt to shake the people’s confidence in the courts  is to strike at the very root of our system of democracy.”<br/>His Lordship went on to say,<br/>“The law punishes not only acts which do in  fact interfere with the courts and administration of justice but also those which have that tendency, that is to say, are likely to produce a particular result….[The] likely effect of his words must be seen and they have clearly the effect of lowering the prestige of judges and courts in the eyes of the people.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the instant case the contemnor-respondents are highly placed Ministers of the Government. What they say in public  is listened to by the masses. They are respected by the  public at large for the positions they hold. They represent the people in Parliament and the general public look up to them. Anything they say is bound to have an effect on the minds of the public at large. When Ministers make utterances denigrating the Chief Justice and question the impartiality  of the justice delivery system, which they do by doubting the impartiality of the Chief Justice, then the whole judiciary  is brought to disrepute.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the recent case of <strong>The State –versus- Swadesh Roy   </strong>(the judgement is yet unreported) the short order is reported in <strong>12 ADC (2015) 932, </strong>it was observed that<strong>,</strong></li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“</strong>Scandalisation, to express shortly, includes an attack upon any Judge in his public capacity for, such attack would be calculated to malign the Judge and to lower the authority of the Court over which the Judge performs his judicial function. At the same time, it also amounts to interference  with  course  of  justice  and  the proper administration thereof. Criticism of Judges of the highest Court in respect of acts done in their administrative capacity, which contain improper imputation, amounts to contempt. If the Chief Justice is criticized for acts done in his administrative capacity this also amounts to contempt. The criticism should be fair and not made with oblique motive or with the object of maligning the justice delivery system and lowering  the majesty of the law and dignity of the Court in the estimation of the public.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the said case it was observed by this Division as follows, per Surendra Kumar Sinha, CJ:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“In view of our constitutional scheme, non-compliance with the Supreme Court’s order would not only dislodge the cornerstone maintaining the equilibrium and equanimity in the State’s governance, there would be a breakdown of constitutional functioning of the State.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It was further observed,</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“For the judiciary to perform its duties, functions effectively and be true to the spirit with which it is sacredly entrusted, the dignity and authority of the courts have to be respected and protected at all costs. The only weapon of protecting itself from the onslaught to the institution is the long hand of contempt of Court left in the armoury of judicial repository which, when needed, can reach any neck howsoever high or far away it may be.” His Lordship went on to observe, “The maintenance of the dignity of courts is one of the pertinent principles of rules of law in a democratic set-up and any criticism of the judicial institution couched in the language that apparently appears to be mere criticism but ultimately results in undermining the dignity of the Court cannot be permitted when found having crossed the limit.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It was observed that the [contempt] jurisdiction is not exercised to protect the dignity of an individual judge but to protect the administration of justice from being maligned. Interference with the administration of justice, which may have the tendency to pervert the course of justice, has been termed as a serious type of contempt.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It was observed:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“contempt may be constituted by any conduct that brings authority of the Court into disrespect or disregard or undermines its dignity and prestige. Scandalising the Court is the worst kind of contempt. Making imputations touching the impartiality and integrity of a judge or making sarcastic remarks about his judicial competence  is also contempt. Conduct or action causing obstruction or interfering with the course of justice is contempt.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">That judgment, as well as others delivered by the Appellate Division, undoubtedly falls to be classified as law of the land, which calls for abidance by all citizens as provided by article 21(1) of the Constitution. <em>A fortiori</em>, it applies more to Cabinet Ministers who speak to the populace with authority and in whom the citizens place particular trust as their leaders.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sequence of events in the proceedings of the instant case:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Let us look at the sequence of events in the proceedings of the instant case which will shed light on the quality of the apology contained in the papers supplied by the respondents in juxtaposition with the utterances made by them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">On the date first fixed for appearance of the contemnors, on 15 March 2016 respondent No. 1 filed an affidavit seeking an adjournment due to his previously fixed official duties abroad to attend the FAO Regional Conference. In the same affidavit he expressed his unconditional apology and deep regret and remorse for the statements and comments made by him. In respect of respondent No. 2, we find two affidavits, both of which were sworn on 14 March 2016 and  each of them contained the contents of his affidavit in  Bangla sworn before a Notary Public. In both the affidavits placed before the Court the contemnor tendered his “unconditional apology in acknowledgement of his inadvertent failure to remain vigilant for not making any statement regarding a matter pending for judgement before this Hon’ble Court.” It is noted, however, that in one affidavit he prayed for exoneration from the proceedings and in the other he prayed for dispensing with his personal appearance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During the course of hearing on 20th March, 2016 the contemnors each placed before the Court their affidavits admitting their guilt and praying for acceptance of their unconditional apology. In the course of deliberations, Mr Rafiq-ul-Huq, learned Counsel appearing for respondent No.2 was asked to place the oath of allegiance which was sworn  by the Ministers when taking oath of office. The Hon’ble Chief Justice posed the question as to what should be the outcome  if the Ministers breach their oath of office to protect the Constitution. He also pointed out that the admission of guilt by any member of the public is not the same as that of the respondents who have taken oath under the Constitution. Mr Rafiq-ul-Huq submitted that since his client admitted his guilt and apologised unconditionally, it is up to the court, which may impose a minor penalty.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We may state at this juncture that in a case of the type which is before us, it is not the function of this Court invariably to dictate the consequence of the findings with regard to matters raised and deliberated during the course of hearing. As we have noted above, the Hon’ble Chief Justice posed the question in open Court as to whether the contemnors had acted in breach of their oath of office and what would be the outcome if the oath of office was breached. This matter was thus brought to the notice of all concerned, though no formal written notice was issued upon the contemnors regarding the violation of their oath of office, and what would be the consequence thereof. The oath of office was placed before the Court. Thus the issue was deliberated in open Court and we cannot totally ignore any issue that was deliberated and what transpired during the course of hearing. As such, we are bound to come to a finding on the issue. The learned Counsel for the respondent made his submissions on the issue and admitted the guilt of the respondents with regard to the utterances made by them. Those utterances indicate their intention to divert the course of justice and to obtain a judgement of their desire, which is blatant interference with the administration of justice and is in contravention of the rule of law, which in turn is violative of the Constitution. We have come to a clear finding that the respondents before us have acted in violation of law which is a violation of the Constitution and they are consequently in breach of their oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. What will be the consequence of breach of their oath of office is not for this Court to decide.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">With regard to the apology of the respondents, Md.  Abdul Wahhab Miah, J. pointed out that apology should be brief, as is the tradition of this Court. He observed that the respondents had given lengthy explanations. The matter was adjourned to 27<sup>th</sup> of March, 2016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">During the course of hearing on 27th March, 2016, learned Counsel for the respondents placed two further affidavits before the Court. Respondent No.1 again expressed regret and remorse for his utterances and placing himself at the mercy  of the Court prayed for acceptance of his apology and for exoneration from civil and criminal liability. Respondent  No.2 in his affidavit also begged unconditional and unequivocal apology for his utterances and prayed to exempt (sic.) him from the contempt proceeding. At the request of  the Court, the learned Attorney General placed before us  the statements of the two contemnors as published in the Daily Janakantha on 7th March, 2016, the relevant portions of which are reproduced below:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>   “</strong><strong>জামায়াত-বিএনপি এবং তা­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>দর লবিস্টরা যে

justify;">It is noted that, according to the report in the Daily Janakantha, in the meeting held on 5th March respondent No. 2 also demanded that the Chief Justice steps aside from the appeal hearing.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The respondents neither denied having made the statements as reported in the newspaper, which were placed before the Court nor sought any adjournment to explain or clarify the contents of the reports which were read out in Court.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The utterances in the instant case:</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">It may be mentioned here that during the course of hearing any matter, the judges often pose questions and make queries in open Court in order that the parties get an opportunity to clarify any fact or issue or to elucidate  their contentions and submissions. These  comments/ queries from the Bench do not usually form part of the judgement. Keeping in mind that the matter is <em>sub judice </em>before pronouncement of judgement, it is not proper that anyone should comment on or criticise such verbal exchanges inside the Courtroom. As we have noted earlier, there is no wrong in critiquing a judgement once it is finally published. However, it must be borne in mind that deliberations during the course of any hearing may not be subjected to analysis or criticism since such comments in a <em>sub judice </em>matter might be  prejudicial and taint the mind of the public before the judgement is pronounced.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An analysis of the statements made by the respondents is called for. A common theme of the statements made by the two respondents is that they did not wish the Chief Justice to continue on the bench hearing the criminal appeal of Mir Kashem Ali. <strong>‡</strong><strong>­</strong><strong>গাল­টেবিল ~~বঠ­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ক প্রধান বিচারপতি এস কে সিনহা­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ক বাদ দি­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>য় নতুন বেঞ্চ গঠন ক</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>­</strong><strong>র মীর কা­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>শ­মের আপী­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>লর পুনঃশুনানির দাবি ক­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>রন ম¿»ী কামরুল ইসলামz </strong><strong>...</strong><strong> মুও্রিযুদ্ধ বিষয়ক ম¿»ী আ ক ম মোজা­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ম্মল হকও ব­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>লছি­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>লন প্রধান বিচারপতি­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ক স</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>­</strong><strong>র দাঁড়া­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>তz</strong> This is clearly a blatant interference with the administration of justice in a matter which is <em>sub judice </em>and was fixed for pronouncement of judgement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Their statements to the effect that “<strong>এই মামলার রায় কী হ­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ব, তা প্রধান বিচারপতির প্রকা­শ্য আদাল­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ত বক্ত­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ব্যর ম</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ধ্য দি­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>য় আমরা অনুধাবন কর­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>ত পে­</strong><strong>‡</strong><strong>রছিz</strong><strong>“</strong> clearly indicates their doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the Chief Justice. Respondent No.1 having understood that it was not proper for him to make any comment about a matter which is <em>sub judice </em>stated, <strong>“</strong><strong>তিনি ব­লেন, বিচারাধীন বিষয় নি­­য় কোন কথা বলা সমীচীন নয়, এটা আমি স্বীকার করছিz কি¿º বিচারাধীন বিষয় নি­য়ে বিচার চলাকালীন কেউ ­কোন পক্ষ­কে এরকমভা­বে হার্ট বা কষ্ট দি­তে পা­রেন নাz কষ্ট দি­­য়­ছেন ব­লেই আমার মুখ দি­য়ে এ রকম কথা ­বের হ­য়ে­ছেz জনম­নের সংশয় দূর করার জন্য এই আপীল জানি­য়েছি (প্রধান বিচারপতি­কে বাদ দি­য়ে বেঞ্চ গঠন)</strong><strong>“.</strong> Both respondents were emphatic in their desires to see that the death penalty is upheld. This is patently prejudging the outcome of the appeal which was fixed for pronouncement of judgement. “<strong>এখনও প্রত্যাশা করি রায়টা ঠিক হোকz মীর কা­শেম আলী­কে ছে­ড়ে দি­লে কলিজাটা ফে­টে যা­বে- ব­লেন এই ম¿»ীz</strong><strong>“</strong>  This  clearly  is aimed  at arousing the sentiments of the public with the intention of creating a negative impact on their minds. In fact they insinuated  that  the  Honourable  Chief  Justice  was making comments openly supporting those of the parties opposed to the war of liberation. “<strong>খাদ্যম¿»ী ব­লেন, আমরা অতী­তে সকল রা­য়ের সময় যেভা­বে মা­ঠে ছিলাম, ৮ তারিখে তেমনি মা­ঠে থাকবz আজ­কে বিভিন্ন পত্র-পত্রিকায় এ বিচার সম্প­র্কে কথা উঠে­ছেz প্রসিকিউশন রাজনীতি কর­ছে এ কথা উঠে­­ছz অর্থাৎ জামায়াত-বিএনপি এবং তা­দের লবিস্টরা যে সু­রে কথা বল­ছে, ­সে কথাটা আজ­কে প্রধান বিচারপতি প্রকা­শ্যে ব­­ল­­ছনz</strong>“ The respondents openly expressed their doubts about the decision to be delivered by the highest court and were  clearly determined to arouse public opinion expressing their demand to obtain a particular outcome, namely upholding of the death sentence of Mir Kashem Ali. <strong>“</strong><strong>তিনি ব­লেন, আমরা এত কিছু বুঝি না, আমরা প্রত্যাশিত রায় চাইz একজন ম¿»ী হি­­স­­ব নয়, একজন মুক্তিযোদ্ধা হি­সে­­ব, একজন সাধারণ বিচারপ্রার্থী হি­­স­বে এ মামলারও বিচারপ্রার্থীz বিচার প্রার্থীরা আজ হতাশz এ বিচা­রের  রায় কি হ­­ব তা­দের ম­­ন একটা স­ন্দেহ আ­ছেz আমরা প্রত্যাশা  করি আমা­দের স­­ন্দহ দূর হ­­বz আমরা প্রত্যাশিত রায় ৮ তারিখে পাবz</strong>” This clearly shows the intention of the respondents to bully the Supreme Court into delivering the judgement according to their demand upholding the death penalty of Mir Kashem Ali. Their justification for the utterances, as apparent from their affidavits, is that they were Muktijodda and were swayed by their emotions and sentiments. However, they, of all people, being sitting Cabinet Ministers should stop to think and realise the consequences of their utterances. It has to be said that their justifications have watered down the quality of their apologies, which cannot be anything other than a perfunctory, face-saving exercise motivated to get a lesser punishment.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Oath of office</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">In the case of <strong><em>Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque, </em></strong><strong><em>Secretary General, Bangladesh Environmental</em></strong><strong><em> Lawyers Association (BELA) being dead Ms. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, Director (Program), representing Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association(BELA) Vs. Bangladesh and others,2002 22 BLD  534, </em></strong>Khairul Haque, J.<strong>, </strong>as his Lordship was then, observed as follows:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">“The oath of office of the Judges of the Supreme Court requires that they will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of Bangladesh. These are not mere ornamental empty words. These glorifying words of oath eulogizes the supremacy of judiciary. It is by now well settled that if the Government or its functionaries fails to act and perform its duties cast upon them by  the laws of this Republic, the High Court Division of  the Supreme Court, shall not remain a silent spectator  to the inertness on the part of the Government or its officials, rather, in order to vindicate its oath of office can issue, in its discretion, necessary orders  and directions, under Article 102 of the Constitution to carry out the intents and purposes of any law to its letter, in the interest of the people of Bangladesh because all powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of the Constitution.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Government Ministers before taking up their office have to swear the following oath, which appears in the Third Schedule of the Constitution:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>   "</strong>2. <strong>The 4[Prime Minister] 5[***] and other Ministers, Ministers of State and Deputy Ministers].</strong>- Oaths (or affirmations) in the following forms shall be administered by the President-<br/><strong>   (a) Oath (or affirmation) of office:</strong><br/>   “I,........., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of Prime Minister(or as the case may be ) according to law:<br/>   That I will bear true faith and allegiance to Bangladesh:<br/>   That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution:<br/>   And that I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear of favour, affection or ill-will.”<strong>''</strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">Our discussion above regarding the utterances of the contemnors has clearly shown their wish to remove the Chief Justice from the Bench hearing the appeal in question. Their further utterance that they must have their expected judgement shows their utter indifference to the authority of the Supreme Court to act independently. It also shows their utter disregard for the rule of law. The Constitution gives the Supreme Court authority to deliver judgements in accordance with law, but the respondents wished to dictate what decision should be announced by the Supreme Court for it to be acceptable to them. The said utterances show an intention to divert the course of justice in a particular   way, come what may, which is contrary to the mandate of the Constitution which requires that every citizen should enjoy the protection of the law and be treated in accordance with law. The utterances of the respondents therefore demand that the Supreme Court should decide the appeal other than in accordance with law which is violative of the Constitution. The respondents thus neglected their sworn duty to protect the rule of law enshrined in the Constitution.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">We are in no doubt that the respondents have intentionally made the utterances as reported and have indeed expressly admitted their guilt. They have acted in violation of law and are in breach of their oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. In their exuberance, they have undermined the sanctity of the institution of the judiciary by questioning the justice delivery system. The Constitution enjoins all citizens to abide by the law and makes the decisions of the Supreme Court law to be given effect to by all. The respondents have scandalized the Supreme Court in a highly motivated manner in order to influence the judgement of the Court. This is gross criminal contempt and a violation of the provisions of the Constitution. The contemnors deserve no sympathy other that the lenient view taken in awarding sentence which has already been expressed in the short order passed by this Court on 27<sup>th</sup> March, 2016.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In the light of the above discussion, the matter is disposed of finding the contemnors guilty of gross contempt and awarding the punishment as already mentioned in the short order of this Court.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>J.</strong><br/><strong><u>Hasan Foez Siddique, J:</u></strong></div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">I have had the privilege of perusing the opinion tendered by my esteemed brother Muhammad Imman Ali, J. The opinion is based on cogent reasons and correct proposition of law. There can, therefore, be no question of disagreement with my learned brother as to the findings of guilt of the contemners and sentence awarded. But I am unable to agree with the portion that the contemners are in breach of their oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is not the issue in the proceeding to adjudicate whether the contemner-respondents have acted in breach of their oath of office or not. No notice was issued in that regard drawing attention to the contemner-respondents, who are sitting ministers of the Cabinet. I am of the view, that our point for consideration is whether by making utterances, published in the newspapers, the contemner- respondents have committed any contempt of this Court or not.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is relevant here to state a few words regarding contempt of Court.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         “Throughout the English history contempt has been the vehicle for deciding a variety of dramatic and significant social problems. When Hal was the Prince of Wales (later to become Henry V of England) one of his servants was arrested for committing a felony. Upon his servant’s arraignment at the King’s Bench, the prince appeared in a rage and demanded that his man be let free. Chief Justice Gascoigne delicately but firmly ruled that the laws of the realm must be met, and that if the prince wished his servant to be pardoned he should secure this from the King, his father. The prince tried physically to take the servant away, whereupon Gascoigne ordered him again to behave. When the prince raged (and some say he even struck Gascoigne) the judge reminded the prince that he kept the peace of the King to whom even Hal owed allegiance and suggested that Hal set a good example. When Hal did not heed this advice, he was  sentenced for contempt, and committed to the King’s Bench prison until the King’s pleasure could be known. People speculated whether this would be the end of Gascoigne’s career. It developed that the king was pleased and rejoiced that he had both a judge who dared to minister justice to his son and a son who obeyed him (if reluctantly)” (Lives of Chief Justices of England by Campbell 125).</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">History tells us how a State is protected by its Courts and an independent judiciary is the cardinal pillar of the ordered progress of a stable Government. A high sense of civic conscience among the people should be infused by exercising such summary powers so as to generate a spontaneous regard for an implicit obedience to its Law Courts. It further tells us that if there is an over- enthusiastic executive, which attempts to belittle the importance of the Court and its judgments and orders, and to lower down its prestige and confidence before the public; these summary powers are all the more necessary, and the dignity, decency and decorum of the Courts of justice are to be preserved in the very interest of the people and for the safety of the public. These powers are the legal brakes to sudden outbursts either by the litigants, the press or the executive. They are necessary to modulate their conducts so as to give all reverence to the temple of justice.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Rule of Law is the basic rule of governance of any civilized democratic policy. Our constitutional scheme is based upon the concept of “Rule of Law” which we have adopted and given to ourselves. Everyone, whether individually or collectively is unquestionably under the supremacy of law. Whoever the person may be, however high he or she is, no-one is above the law notwithstanding how powerful and how rich he or she may be. Even the Supreme Court is subordinate to the law and not above the law. For achieving the establishment of the rule of law, the Constitution has assigned the special task to the judiciary in the country. It is only through the Courts that the rule of law unfolds its contents and establishes its concept. For the judiciary to perform its duties and functions effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly entrusted, the dignity and authority of the Courts have to be respected and protected at all costs. The only weapon of protecting itself from onslaught to the institution is the long hand of contempt of court left in the armoury of judicial repository which, when needed, can reach any neck howsoever or far away it may be. Judiciary is central pillar of democracy.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">When contempt is committed in the face of the Supreme Court to scandalise or humiliate the Court and the Judge, instant action may be necessary. If the courts do not deal with such contempt with strong hand, that may result in scandalising the institution thereby lowering its dignity in the eyes of the public. The courts exist for the people. The courts charished the faith reposed in them by people. To prevent erosion of that faith, contempt committed in the face of the court needs a strict treatment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">E.M.S. Namboodripad, the then Chief Minister of Kerala, at a press conference held by him at Trivandrum, on November 9, 1967 stated inter alia, “Marx and Engels considered the judiciary as an instrument of oppression and even today  when the State set up has not undergone any change it continues to be so ------- the Judges are guided by and dominated by class hatred, class interests and class prejudices and where the evidence is balanced between a well dressed pol-bellied rich man and a poor ill dressed and illiterate person, the Judge instinctively favours the former.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">While upholding the order of conviction and sentence of Namboodripad awarded by Kerala High Court in a proceeding of contempt of Court Supreme Court of India held “It is clear that it is an attack, upon Judges which is calculated to raise in the minds of the people a general dissatisfaction with, and distruct of all judicial decisions. It weakens the authority of law and law courts”. (1970 (2) SCC 375=AIR 1970 SC 245).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In a democracy there is no need for judges to vindicate their authority to display pomp and majesty. Their authority comes not from fear of contempt but from the public confidence, and this in terms depends on their own conduct, integrity, impartiality and learning.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Its object is not to project the dignity of the court, but to project the administration of justice “Justice is not   a cloistered virtue” said Lord Atkin. “It must suffer the scrutiny and outspoken comments of ordinary men.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It must be remembered that the maintenance of dignity of Courts is one of the cardinal principles of rule of law in a democratic set up and any criticism of the judicial institution couched in language that apparently appears to be mere criticism but ultimately results in undermining the dignity of the Courts cannot be permitted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">“The power to punish for contempt is a rare species of judicial power which by very nature calls for exercise with great care and caution.  Such power ought to be exercised  only where silence is no longer an option” (Bal Krishna  Giri V. State of U.P. (2014) 7 SCC 280).</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In R Vs. Commr of Police (1968) 2 QB 150 Lord Denning observed, “Let may say at once that we will never use this jurisdiction to uphold our own dignity. That must rest on  surer foundations. Nor will we use it to suppress those who speak against us. We do not fear criticism, nor do we resent it. For there is something far from important at stake. It is no less than freedom of speech itself---- All that we ask is that those who criticize us should remember that, from the nature of our duties, we cannot reply to their criticism. We cannot enter into public controversy we must rely on our conduct itself to be its own vindication”.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Once a British Newspaper ran a banner headline calling the majority Judges of the House of Lords who decided the Spycarcher Case (Attorney General Vs. Guardian Newspaper, 1987 3 AII ER.316) “YOU FOOLS”. Fali Nariman, who was present in England at that time, asked Lord Templeman, who was one of the majority, “why the Judge did not take contempt action.” Lord Templeman smiled, and said that Judges in England took no notice of personal insults. Although he did not regard himself as a fool, other were entitled to their opinion.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Lord Denning in his “Family Story” has recorded what Lord Shawcross about one of his judgments: “Denning is an  Ass”. The Times (of London) published this. In spite of it, Lord Denning declined to take contempt action since he took the view that he would disprove it not by contempt proceedings but by means of his performance. Of course, he is regarded as the best Judge of the Commonwealth.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Justice Krishna Ayer In re S Mulgaokar (1978 (3) SCC 338=AIR 1978 SC 727 while giving the broad guidelines in taking punitive action in the matter of contempt of court observed:</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         “------- If the Courts the attack on the Judge or Judges scurrilous, offensive intimatory, or malicious beyond condonable limits, the strong arms of law must, in the name  of public interest and public justice, strike a blow on him who challenges the supremacy of the rule of law by fouling  its source and steam.”</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">To illustrate, in Duda’s Case (AIR 1988 SC 1208), a Union Cabinet Minister said that the Supreme Court Sympathized with zaminders and bank magnates. He further said “FERA” violators, bride burners, and a whole horde of reactionaries have found their haven in the Supreme court and that Supreme Court Judges have ‘unconcealed sympathy for the haves’.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">No action was taken against him.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Supreme Court of India while proceeding with against Prashant Bhushan in contempt case, former Law Minister Shanti Bhuson father of Prashant Bhushan told the Supreme court that he and his son would prefer to go to Jail instead of tendering an apology for pointing to corruption in the Judiciary. Bhusan told this to the court after he and his son were asked if they were willing to offer an apology. He  became a party to the contempt case by filing an affidavit saying that of 16 Chief Justices’ of India, eight were “definitely corrupt”, six were “definitely honest” and for  two of the “ a definite opinion cannot be expressed”. The contempt proceedings were initiated after Prashanta Bhushan  in an interview to Tehelka leveled allegation of corruption against the sitting Judges of the Apex Court. Prashanta Bhushan in his interview had alleged that Justice S.H. Kapadia (became Chief Justice of India) who had the shares in Sterlite company decided a mining lease case in favour of the Company.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It is only through the Courts that rule of law unfolds its contours and establishes its concept. For the judiciary  to carry out its obligations effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly entrusted the task, constitutional Courts have been given the power to punish for contempt, but greater the power; higher the responsibility.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">I shall conclude with the following words of Lord Denning in his “What Next in The Law”, “It is the right of everyman, in Parliament or out of it, in the press or over   the broadcast, to make fair comment, even outspoken comment, on matters of public interest…… we cannot enter into public controversy. Still less into political controversy. We must rely on our conduct itself to be its own vindication.”</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">         “The Bench is sacred seat and divinity is incompatible with arrogance, pride and Vanity”. Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court observed,</div><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">“Therefore, Judge must be kept mindful of their limitations and of their ultimate public responsibility by a vigorous stream of criticism expressed with candor however blunt.”</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Every holder of a Public office by virtue of which he acts on behalf of the State or Public body is ultimately accountable to the people in whom sovereignty vest. As such, all powers so vested in him are meant to be exercised for public good and promoting the public interest. The duty of all organs of the state is that the public trust and confidence in the judiciary may not go in vain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keeping in mind the above matters we have convicted and sentenced the contemners to set an example and to give caution to all that it has become fashion to criticise the Judges for no fault of them.  But the observation as to breach of oath of office is not in consonance with the notice issued upon the contemners. As such I cannot agree with that observation.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>J.</strong><br/><strong>Mirza Hussain Haider, J: </strong>I have gone through the judgement proposed to be delivered by my brother, Muhammad Imman   Ali, J. and the separate opinion given by my brother Hasan Foez Siddique, J.
