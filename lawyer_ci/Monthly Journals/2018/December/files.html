In due course, it purchased spare parts of watch from Hong Kong worth of USD 18,911.00 equivalent to Bangladeshi Tk.12,10,000/-, which weighed around 322 Kgs. and were packeted in 9 cartoons. Those goods were booked in Hong Kong to be delivered in Dhaka through Bangladesh Biman, vide air-way bill No.997-8632-1653 dated 21.01.1999, scheduled to carry those goods through BG Flight No.079 on 22.01.1999. But those goods did not reach in Dhaka through the scheduled flight and, consequently, the Biman authority could not deliver those goods. The plaintiff-respondent repeatedly demanded to get delivery of goods. The defendants enquired into the matter but whereabouts of goods could not be detected. The defendants offered to pay compensation in terms and conditions laid down in the contract provided in Air-way bill assessing at USD 6400.00 on calculation of the loss goods weighing around 322 Kgs, the declared weight of the undelivered goods, at the rate of USD 20.00 per Kg. The compensation amount offered was equivalent to Bangladeshi Tk.3,15,560.00 as per the prevailing conversion rate, vide defendant’s letters dated 19.08.1999 and 08.09.1999, against the claim of compensation made by the plaintiff for Tk.16,98,000.00.

The High Court Division held that the date on which the carriage stopped was in the instant case the date on which the defendant admitted its failure to deliver the goods finally and offered payment of compensation in lieu of the goods. Rule 13(3) of schedule B of the First schedule of the Act provides that if the carrier admits the loss of the goods or if the goods have not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which they ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to put into force against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage. In view of specific provision of Rule 13(3) it was immaterial that the defendant purportedly admitted the loss of the goods on 19.08.1999 and offered the plaintiff compensation in lieu thereof since the time for limitation began to run from the expiry of 7 days after the date on which the goods ought to have arrived, i.e. on 22.01.1999. From the materials on record of this case, it appears that the goods “ought to have arrived” on 22.01.1999 and the carrier through which the goods was supposed to be carried to the destination arrived as per schedule on 22.01.1999. The instant suit has been filed on 24.05.2001. The High Court Division held that the date on which the carriage stopped provided in Rule 29 of First Schedule of the Act corresponding to clause 12.3 of the Airway Bill mean “refusal by the carrier or its agent to deliver the goods” inasmuch as the term ‘the date on which the carriage stopped’ is to be interpreted as the date when in normal course of event the goods arrived. The contract of carriage seized to exist and the goods are actually delivered to the consignee whereby the carrier is no longer ‘in charge’ of the actual custody and control of the goods within the meaning of Rule 18 of the First Schedule of the Act. In the instant case since good never ‘arrived at the destination’ there being no actual delivery thereon to the respondent, it be said that there was a date when the carriage stopped. The High Court Division committed an error of law in holding that the date on which carriage stopped was the date on which the carrier defendants admitted its failure to deliver its goods finally and offered payment of compensation in lieu of the goods. The time for limitation began to run from the expiry of 7 days after the date on which the goods ought to have arrived, that is, on 22.01.1999. Since the suit was filed on 24.05.2001 apparently the same was barred by limitation in view of special limitation provided in Rule 29 of the first schedule of the Carriage by Air (International Convention) Act, 1966 read with section 29 of the Limitation Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Since the suit was barred by limitation, though the defendants admitted the damage caused and offered compensation in view of terms of contract, that is, terms of Airway-bill, we are of the view that it is unnecessary to discuss the second point raised the Mr. Alam.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">28.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

On the other hand, for giving relief under Section 396 relieving the accused person from fine, carrying out inquiry by this Court as to whether the accused person “acted honestly and reasonably” is also not a easy business for this Court given that since it has not been possible for the Legislature to provide particular set of facts or circumstances based on which it can be said that the accused person acted honestly or reasonably, therefore, this Court also can not set out any guideline for determining “the honest and reasonable action” of the accused person. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Nonetheless, from the maxim of equity <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“He who comes into equity must come with clean hands”</em>, it has by now become a well-settled principle of our jurisdiction that if an applicant comes to the Court with clean hands, he deserves mercy of, and remedy from, the Court. For example, when a company who for the first time has defaulted in complying with the provisions of Section 151 (1) of the Companies Act either because of ignorance of law as to the company’s legal obligation of filing Shares Allotment Return to the RJSC within sixty days or the company was aware of its legal obligation, but due to some bonafide mistake the document was not filed within the prescribed time, the company may claim that it has come before this Court with clean hands. In ascertaining as to whether the company’s concerned responsible person ‘acted honestly and reasonably,’ the Court may inquire into the past history of the said accused person/s in dealing with such matter on top of taking into consideration the knowledge, experience and financial condition of the accused person. Upon examining the statements made in the petition if the Court is of the view that the company has the past record of non-compliance of the provisions of the Companies Act or the delay in filing the Return of the Allotment of Shares is aimed at gaining unlawful advantage from share-holders or debtors or contributors, in that case, the Court may decline to relieve the delinquents person/s of the company from the fine incurred for every day during which period the default continued.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">       </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Thus, in a matter under Section 151 read with Section 396 of the Companies Act, the first issue requires to be adjudicated upon by this Court is whether the petitioner-company has been able to make out a case to “satisfy” this Court that the failure to file the document within the statutory period of sixty days was not deliberate and the petitioner-company is not a habitual defaulter in filing any such document with the RJSC and, in order to satisfy this Court, the petitioner must make a full disclosure about such omission, including any delay which had happened in the past in filing any type of ‘Return’ together with producing a letter from the RJSC stating as to whether the petitioner is a first-time defaulter or a habitual defaulter. In laying down this <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em>, I am heavily relying on the observations made by his Lordship Justice H.

In other words, the first issue to be considered by this Court in a matter under Section 151 read with Section 396 of the Companies Act is whether the petitioner approached this Court bonafide without having any ulterior motive, as was held in the case of Anwar Jute Baling Limited 21 DLR 412.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The second issue to be considered is whether any one would be prejudiced if the time is not extended to file the document and, finally, whether the facts and circumstances suggest to extend time for filing the documents by relieving the delinquents from the fine on just and equitable grounds, if the proceeding for slapping fine has not been already started by the office of the RJSC.

The owner of the property, Gopi Dasi by a registered kabala deed dated 04.02.1960 transferred the land in favour of one Mayzuddin and the purchaser Mayzuddin after mutation of his name started to pay rents to the Government. Subsequently, Mayzuddin transferred 06 decimals of land in favour of one Shawkat Ali and 05 decimals in favour of one Ruhul Amin. Out of the remaining 05 decimals of land Moyzuddin transferred 2 ½ decimal in favour of the plaintiff No. 01 by a transfer deed dated 03.12.1973 A.D. and the rest 2 ½ decimals of land was transferred in favour of the father of the Defendant No. 02 by Moyzuddin. The further case of the plaintiffs is such that the plaintiff No. 01 and the father of the plaintiff No. 02 also purchased 07 decimals of land from plot No. 1618 which is adjacent to the suit plot. The plaintiffs are possessing their purchased land jointly and mutated their names in the Government <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">seresta </em>and paying rents to the Government. They have erected their dwelling huts in the suit property and residing therein. In the suit property the plaintiffs have pacca building and in the preliminary stage of R.S. record, 12 decimals of land was recorded in the names of the plaintiff No. 01 and the father of the plaintiff No. 02. The father of plaintiff No. 02 died leaving behind five daughters, one wife and one son, the plaintiffs No. 02. The plaintiff No. 02 by a registered sub-kabala deed dated 16.04.1989 A.D. purchased the lands of other co-sharers measuring 06 decimals of land in the suit holding.

Anyway, the respondent no. 2 Agrani Bank Limited as plaintiff instituted Title Suit No. 217 of 1992 in the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka impleading the respondent nos. 3-10 as defendants for realization of Tk. 7,55,686.61/-. Eventually the suit was decreed on contest by the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka on 07.09.2001. Thereafter the decree-holder respondent-Agrani Bank Limited filed Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 in the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka. During the process of execution of the decree, the respondent no. 1, in compliance with Section 33(1) of the Artha Rin Adalat Ain, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the Ain of 2003), invited tender for auction sale of the mortgaged properties as described in the schedules to the Execution Case Petition. The said tender notice was published in “The Daily Manabzamin” on 20.02.2004. On 03.03.2004, only a single bid was submitted and that being so, the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1 by its order dated 03.03.2004 refused to accept the bid and directed the decree-holder bank to take steps according to Section 33(4) of the Ain of 2003. On 28.03.2004, the Artha Rin Adalat, according to the provisions of Section 33(4) of the Ain of 2003, again published an auction notice in two national dailies, namely, “The Daily Inqilab” and “The Daily Jugantor” for auction sale of the scheduled properties. In response to the said auction sale notice, the present petitioner submitted its bid offering in all a sum of Tk. 6,10,00,000/- for the scheduled properties and by this offer, it became the highest bidder. On 11.04.2004, the respondent-bank filed an application before the Artha Rin Adalat to accept the bid of the petitioner as the decree-holder bank was satisfied therewith. But nevertheless the Artha Rin Adalat by its order dated 11.04.2004 refused to accept the bid of the petitioner-company holding, inter alia, that the offer was very low than the market price and fixed 28.04.2004 for taking necessary steps under Section 33(5) of the Ain of 2003. Anyway, the ‘Ka’ scheduled property is situated on Plot No. 354(old), 16 (new), Road No. 28(old), 15(new), Dhanmondi Residential Area, Dhaka (hereinafter mentioned as Dhanmondi property). The other scheduled properties are situated at Kachpur and Bahakoir under Sonargaon Upazilla in the District of Narayanganj. However, the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 refusing to accept the bid of the petitioner is unsustainable in law inasmuch as the decree-holder bank consented to the acceptance of the bid by the Executing Court. Furthermore, the bid of the petitioner-company can not be said to be shockingly low, regard being had to the market price of the properties of similar nature. The impugned order dated 11.04.2004 is, therefore, illegal, arbitrary and unreasonable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 18.08.2004 filed on behalf of the petitioner, it has been stated that at the time of preparation of the Writ Petition, the petitioner could not annex the certified copies of the plaint of the Title Suit No. 217 of 1992 and the judgment and decree dated 30.04.2001 passed therein and those documents are necessary for disposal of the instant Writ Petition and accordingly those documents have been annexed to the Supplementary Affidavit and marked as Annexure- ‘G’ series.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The respondent no. 2 Agrani Bank Limited has filed an Affidavit-in-Opposition in this Writ Petition.

The decree-holder bank thought it advisable to accept the bid of the petitioner-company by the Executing Court towards liquidation of the loan in the exigency of the prevailing circumstances. So far as the bank’s interest is concerned, the bank could be benefited in realizing the bid money and thereafter in realizing the balance amount through the process of law by attaching other moveable and immovable properties of the judgment-debtors and also by putting the judgment-debtors in civil prison as provided by Section 34 of the Ain of 2003. The offered price of the highest bidder was brought to the notice of the bank management for their decision regarding recovery of the bad debt. The bank management agreed to the sale of the mortgaged properties for the bid amount of Tk. 6,10,00,000/- for the time being. However, the non-acceptance of the offered price of the highest bidder (petitioner-company) is a matter of discretion of the learned Judge of the Executing Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The respondent nos. 3-6 and 8 have filed an Affidavit-in-Opposition in this Writ Petition.

The said suit was decreed by the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka by its judgment and decree dated 30.04.2001 with a direction to pay the decretal amount of Tk. 7,55,22,686.61/- along with interest at the rate of 20%. On 17.04.2003, the decree-holder bank filed Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 claiming recovery of Tk. 22,35,95,053/-; but no notice of the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 was served upon the defendant-judgment-debtor-respondents as evidenced by Annexure-‘7’ series. The auction of the mortgaged properties was held and subsequently the sale was confirmed behind the back of the answering respondents. Besides, no Rule Nisi was prayed for upon the judgment-debtor-respondents in this Writ Petition; rather the Rule Nisi was prayed for only upon the respondent nos. 1 and 2 and accordingly the same was issued upon them only and the Rule was not contested by either of them. As there was no opposition of the Rule by the respondent no. 2-bank, the Rule Nisi was made absolute by the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 directing the respondent no. 1 to accept the bid of the petitioner-company, that is to say, Jubak Housing and Real Estate Development Limited. Accordingly the respondent no. 1, Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka, accepted the bid of the petitioner-company at Tk. 6,10,00,000/- by its order dated 03.10.2004 and issued a sale certificate by its order dated 20.11.2004 which was registered on 25.11.2004. Thereafter the auction-purchaser petitioner-company suddenly ousted and dispossessed the respondent nos. 3-8 on 28.05.2005. Subsequently these respondents enquired into the matter and came to know about the proceedings of the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 and the orchestrated auction sale of the mortgaged properties of the judgment-debtors to the petitioner-company. However, during the pendency of the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006 in the Appellate Division, the petitioner transferred the Dhanmondi property of the judgment-debtors to one Md. Aminul Haque and Md. Aminul Haque transferred the same to the added respondent no. 14 Ope Properties Limited by a registered deed dated 20.01.2011. The added respondent no. 14 undertook a project of construction of a high-rise building on the Dhanmondi property to frustrate the purpose of the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006. Eventually on 20.05.2014, the Appellate Division allowed the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006 filed by the judgment-debtor-respondents and set aside the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed by the High Court Division in this Writ Petition (Writ Petition No. 2067 of 2004) and remanded the Writ Petition to this Court for hearing and disposal of the Rule Nisi afresh on merit in accordance with law after issuing a Rule Nisi upon the appellants of the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006. Afterwards the High Court Division, in compliance with the directive of the Appellate Division given in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, issued a Rule Nisi upon the respondent nos. 3-8 and the High Court Division also directed the parties concerned to maintain status quo in respect of the possession of the property in question. The Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 is still pending for adjudication and the rest of the claimed amount of the decree-holder bank has remained unsatisfied. But even then, the most valuable properties including the Dhanmondi property of the judgment-debtors valuing more than Tk. 200,00,00,000/- (two hundred crore) were sold out at a throw-away price. The impugned order dated 11.04.2004 passed in the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 refusing to accept the bid of the petitioner is lawful and as such no exception can be taken thereto.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The respondent no. 7 has filed a separate Affidavit-in-Opposition in this Writ Petition adopting the Affidavit-in-Opposition dated 21.08.2006 filed by the respondent nos. 3-6 and 8.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">The respondent no. 14 has filed an Affidavit-of-Facts in this Writ Petition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It has been stated in the Affidavit-of-Facts that the petitioner filed the Writ Petition challenging the order dated 11.04.2004 passed by the learned Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka in the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 refusing to accept the bid of the petitioner. However, the background facts are that the respondent no. 2 Agrani Bank Limited as plaintiff filed Title Suit No. 217 of 1992 in the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka against the respondent no. 3 and others for realization of Tk. 7,55,22,686.61/-. The said suit was decreed on contest against the defendant-judgment-debtors for a sum of Tk. 7,55,22,686.61/- with interest at the rate of 20% from 01.10.1992 till realization of the decretal amount within 90(ninety) days. As the defendant-judgment-debtor-respondents failed to pay the decretal amount as ordered, the decree-holder bank put the decree into execution by way of filing the Artha Execution Case No. 59 of 2003 for realization of the decretal dues along with interest and costs. In the Execution Case, an auction notice was published in the newspaper for selling out the mortgaged properties and the petitioner Jubak Housing and Real Estate Development Limited offered the highest bid to the tune of Tk. 6,10,00,000/-. But the Executing Court by the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 refused to accept the bid as it was considered to be very low. Challenging the said order dated 11.04.2004, the petitioner filed the instant Writ Petition and a Division Bench of the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 made the Rule Nisi absolute. As against the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed by the High Court Division in this Writ Petition (Writ Petition No. 2067 of 2004), the writ-respondent no. 3 filed Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006 in the Appellate Division. Ultimately after hearing the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, the Appellate Division by its judgment and order dated 20.05.2014 allowed the appeal by setting aside the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed in this Writ Petition and the Writ Petition was sent back to the High Court Division on remand for fresh adjudication. But before the rendition of the judgment of the Appellate Division in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, the Executing Court complied with the judgment and order dated 23.08.2004 passed by the High Court Division in this Writ Petition and accordingly the Executing Court by its order dated 20.11.2004 issued a sale certificate in favour of the auction-purchaser company and subsequently the sale was confirmed and made absolute. On 28.03.2005, the Executing Court made over the possession of the Dhanmondi property in favour of the auction-purchaser (writ-petitioner). At a subsequent stage, the auction-purchaser writ-petitioner sold the Dhanmondi property to one Md. Aminul Haque by a registered deed dated 21.12.2010. Md. Aminul Haque in his turn sold the self-same property (Dhanmondi property) to the respondent no. 14, that is to say, Ope Properties Limited by a registered deed dated 20.01.2011. The respondent no. 14, on obtaining requisite permission from various concerned authorities, constructed a 13-storied high-rise building thereon; but it was not made a party in this Writ Petition.

It is now settled that a fugitive from justice is not entitled to obtain a judicial order defying the process of the Court. Besides, the learned Advocates who move applications for the fugitives shall also have to face the consequence of committing Contempt of Court. This principle is being followed for over 60 years in this Sub-continent. References in this connection are Chand Shah Vs. Crown, 8 DLR (FC) 24, Gul Hassan Vs.

We fail to understand in the backdrop of the case, how the learned Judges of the Division Bench could even entertain the Writ Petition on behalf of a fugitive from justice, ignoring the long-settled principles being followed by the Courts. If this process is allowed, the fugitives from justice, either convicted or not, will be emboldened and despite processes have been issued, they will defy the processes of the Courts and in such cases, the administration of criminal justice will crumple. We can not conceive of a more flagrant violation of this principle that a convict who seeks the interference of the sovereign to obtain revision of a judicial order must submit to the Court instead of engaging himself in setting that judicial order at naught. It is well-settled that when a person seeks remedy from a Court of law, either in writ jurisdiction or criminal appellate, revisional or miscellaneous jurisdiction under Section 516 A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he ought to submit to the due process of justice.

There can not be any iota of doubt thereabout. But none the less, the decision reported in 15 BLC (AD) 44 can not be shrugged off at all. Needless to say, the two convicts, namely, respondent nos. 5 and 8 are, amongst others, judgment-debtor-respondents in this Writ Petition. Admittedly those two respondents (respondent nos. 5 and 8) are yet to submit to the sentence passed against them by the criminal Court in G. R. Case No. 509 of 2008 on 21.05.2017. As things stand now, the respondent nos. 5 and 8 can not oppose or contest the Rule Nisi through their learned Advocate Mr. Khair Ezaz Maswood unless and until they submit to the sentence passed against them in G. R. Case No. 509 of 2008. As absconding convicts, we can not allow them to oppose and contest the Rule Nisi through their learned Advocate. If we do so, that will amount to setting the rule of law at naught. In the cited decision reported in 15 BLC (AD) 44, the convict came up with the Writ Petition seeking some relief; but in the instant case, by reason of their being respondent nos. 5 and 8, they are not seeking any relief, yet the fact remains that they can not derive any benefit or enjoy the fruit of any judgment or judicial order passed in this case so long as they remain fugitives from law. So the natural consequence is that Mr. Khair Ezaz Maswood can not represent the absconding convicts (respondent nos. 5 and 8) in this case. Precisely speaking, the ‘ratio’ of the decision reported in 15 BLC (AD) 44 will conversely apply to the facts and circumstances of the present case, in so far as the respondent nos. 5 and 8 are concerned. Be that as it may, this finding will not preclude Mr. Khair Ezaz Maswood from representing the other judgment-debtor-respondents and accordingly he can very well represent them in this case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">40.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is undisputed that initially at the instance of the writ-petitioner, a Rule Nisi was issued upon the respondent nos. 1 and 2 only leaving out the judgment-debtor-respondents. The petitioner-company, by way of a smart trick, made the prayer for issuance of the Rule Nisi on those two respondents only (respondent nos. 1 and 2). It may be noted that the respondent no. 1 is the Judge of the Artha Rin Adalat No. 1, Dhaka and the respondent no. 2 is the decree-holder bank. We have already seen that the respondent no. 2 (decree-holder bank) was a consenting party to the bid of the petitioner-company. In this perspective, the bank filed an application before the Executing Court for acceptance of the bid of the petitioner-company. From the conduct of the decree-holder bank, it seems that the bank was in collusion with the auction-purchaser, though the bid amount was less than one-third of the decretal dues. There is no gainsaying the fact that the application of the decree-holder bank for acceptance of the bid of the petitioner was rejected by the self-same impugned order dated 11.04.2004; but curiously enough, the decree-holder bank did not challenge the rejection of its application before the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. It is only the auction-purchaser (petitioner-company) who has challenged the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 by filing the instant Writ Petition. The non-issuance of any Rule Nisi on the judgment-debtor-respondents at the instance of the petitioner-company, we feel constrained to hold, is a glaring manifestation of fraud. Ultimately the Appellate Division came to the rescue of the judgment-debtor-respondents and as per its directive given in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, the High Court Division issued a Rule Nisi upon them. However, this sort of fraud resorted to by the petitioner-company is deprecated. What is more, to our way of thinking, the non-issuance of the Rule Nisi initially upon the judgment-debtor-respondents, at the instance of the petitioner-company, was mala fide as well. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">41.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Admittedly the Rule Nisi initially issued upon the respondent nos. 1 and 2 was made absolute by the High Court Division by its judgment and order dated 23.08.2004.

But we are unable to accept this contention for the simple reason that the entire issue of auction purchase of the mortgaged properties stands re-opened for fresh adjudication by the High Court Division in consequence of the directive given by the Appellate Division in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006. It is true that the Executing Court had to accept the bid of the petitioner-company, confirm the sale and eventually make over the possession of the mortgaged properties in favour of the petitioner-company by way of compliance with the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 23.08.2004 passed in this Writ Petition. But as soon as the judgment and order of the High Court Division dated 23.08.2004 was reversed by the Appellate Division by its judgment and order dated 20.05.2014 passed in the Civil Appeal No. 135 of 2006, this Court is now at liberty to adjudicate upon the matter afresh on merit in accordance with law.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt;

The finding of the Executing Court that the bid money of the petitioner to the tune of Tk. 6,10,00,000/- was very low can not be found fault with in judicial review for justifiable reasons. In other words, we do not find that the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 was made by the Executing Court without any lawful authority. What we are driving at boils down to this: the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 is a valid and legal order passed under the proviso to Sub-Section (2) of Section 33 of the Ain of 2003. Consequently the impugned order dated 11.04.2004 can not be dubbed as an unreasonable, arbitrary and whimsical order.

When the victim Giasuddin came out from inside his house, the convict-appellant opened fire from his firearm indiscriminately aiming at him, on the road near the wall of Bond Fabrics,close to the house, inflicting multiple bleeding injuries on the person of the victim. Convict Ibu, Rubel, Janu and Kala Rafique also shot him from their respective firearms and, thereafter, they went away towards the west. The victim was then taken to Khanpur Hospital by the informant and P.W.10 Ali Hossain and one Zaker. In the Hospital the doctor on duty declared him dead. The informant’s father used to protest the evil acts and misdeeds of the convict persons and he also formed a peace committee locally to maintain law and order in the area and out of the grudge the accused persons killed the victim Giasuddin by gun-shots. The informant, his mother, brother, wife, younger sister and others saw the occurrence by electric light. Hence, he lodged the FIR.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We find from the record that during investigation of the case, the police visited the place of occurrence, held inquest over the dead body of the victim and sent the same to the hospital morgue for postmortem examination, examined the witnesses under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seized the alamats as per seizure lists, prepared the sketch map of the P.O. with separate index and after having found strong prima facie case against the accused persons, submitted charge sheet against the convict appellant and eight others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Then the case record was finally sent for disposal before the Sessions Judge, Narayanganj and at the commencement of the trial charge was framed under sections 302/34 of the Penal Code against all of them, apart from charge-sheeted accused Ibrahim @ Ibu who died in the meantime.

He further submitted that the conviction of the appellant is against the weight of evidence and materials on record. The convict appellant (condemned prisoner) is totally innocent of the charge leveled against him and he has been falsely implicated in the case and he is not in any way involved with the alleged murder. He submitted that P.W.1 is the wife of the deceased, P.W.2 is the informant, a son of the victim, P.W.3 is the daughter, P.W.4 is the son and P.W.5 is the daughter-in-law of the deceased, who are alleged to be eye witnesses of the occurrence and stated in their evidence that the convict appellant fired shots on the deceased with a pistol. But the informant did not mention in the FIR that the convict appellant fired pistol shot on the deceased and only mentioned it as "firearm". The doctor who held the postmortem examination on the dead body of the deceased could not identify the injuries caused on the body of the deceased, whether they were by pistol or by revolver shots, which creates doubt and the appellant is entitled to get the benefit of doubt. He submitted that no case under the Arms Act was filed against the convict appellant nor the alleged pistol was recovered from his possession, which proves that he has been falsely implicated with the alleged occurrence out of previous enmity. He submitted that the convict appellant did not make any confession under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and P.W.6 is the doctor, P.Ws.7, 8, 9, 10 (declared hostile) 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 are not eye witnesses and P.Ws.17, 18 and 19 are police personnel's. He submitted that the most vital and independent witnesses who took the victim to the hospital, i.e. Ali Hossain was examined as P.W.10 who was tendered and Zakir was not examined which creates doubt as to whether anyone saw the occurrence. P.Ws.1, 2, 4 and 5 made contradictory statements and at the time of holding inquest none stated anything, which proves they are not the eye witnesses.

The trial Court noted that the learned Advocate for the defence could not elicit any serious contradiction from the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. It was also noted that the victim Gias Uddin was a Muktijoddha and Adviser to the local Law and Order Committee and was active against the terrorist activities of the accused persons. He also took part in the <em>shalish </em>and decided against the accused persons, as a result of which they became angry which ultimately led to the victim being mercilessly murdered.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that the occurrence took place at 8 O’clock at night when the victim had just returned home and the appellant and other accused persons came to the house of the victim and called him outside and the victim was shot by the appellant a few feet away from his gate. The witnesses recognised the assailants by electric light. Naturally, the inhabitants of his household would be the persons who would witness the occurrence from close quarters. The wife, children and daughter-in-law of the victim are the most natural and competent witnesses in the facts and circumstances of the case. We note that P.W.7, who is a local shopkeeper, deposed that he came to the place of occurrence on hearing shots, saw the victim, who had been shot and also saw the appellant and co-accused Junu running away from the place of occurrence. He stated that he did not know the names of the other assailants. The evidence of P.W.7 is thus independent corroborative evidence of the occurrence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We note from the evidence of the Investigating Officer that no contradictions were elicited from him in respect of the statements of the witnesses recorded under section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">P.W. 6, the doctor, who deposed with regard to the post mortem report, stated that he found 10 bullet injuries on the chest and other parts of the victim’s body. The learned Advocate on behalf of the appellant tried to argue that there was no clear evidence as to whether the injuries were caused by a pistol or by a revolver. In this regard we have to say that to a lay person there is little difference between a pistol and a revolver both fire bullets. The only real distinction is that the revolver has a revolving chamber from which the bullets are fired, whereas a pistol may have a magazine containing between 7 to 16 bullets. The fact remains, the victim suffered as many as 10 bullet injuries, which according to the eye witnesses, were fired from short range.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The learned Advocate for the appellant finally submitted that the sentence of death may be commuted in view of the age of the convict, contradiction in the evidence of the witnesses and the lack of independent corroborative evidence. With regard to the appellant’s conviction under section 302 of the Penal Code, we are left in no doubt about the correctness of the findings of the trial Court. We can find no fault in the assessment of the evidence of the witnesses and other evidence on record.

Ten bullet injuries were found on the victim, which is indicative of the vehemence with which the victim was done to death. The appellant called the victim out of his house on the pretext of some urgent discussion and within a few feet of the gate of his house, was repeatedly and mercilessly shot causing his death.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">22.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We find from the evidence that the victim was actively involved in ensuring law and order in the locality, and as a result his activities were inimical to the activities of the criminal groups. Clearly, this is a case where the victim was an obstruction in the path of local terrorist/criminal gangs, which had to be eliminated. It is equally plain to any law abiding citizen that the accused would do the same again to anyone who made a stand against criminal activities. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Although, it is usual for this Court to take into consideration the youth of the accused, such consideration is given only due to the fact that the young of age act in the heat of the moment without considering the consequence of their action. However, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case it is quite apparent that the appellant deliberately, in a preplanned manner, went to the house of the victim armed with firearms with the sole purpose of removing the obstruction in the path of their criminal activities. Hence, it cannot be said that the action of the accused was resultant from his immaturity of mind. His action was purposeful and intentional, which led to cold-blooded murder of the victim.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The facts of the case taken as a whole naturally give rise to the apprehension that the appellant would not desist from committing a similar offence when it suited him.

Under the Recruitment Rules (Officers and Employees) of the BTTB, 1984 (hereinafter referred to as the Recruitment Rules of 1984), the petitioners were required to complete 5(five) years service and qualify in the prescribed competitive tests for promotion as Telecommunication Technicians (TCTs) from TCMs. Having completed 5(five) years service and successfully passed the competitive tests, they were promoted as TCTs. Thereafter having served for another 5(five) years as TCTs and qualified in the prescribed competitive tests, they were promoted as Non-Diploma Sub-Assistant Engineers (SAEs).

His name is shown at serial no. 889 in the final Gradation List of Non-Diploma SAEs; but as per the said Gradation List, he is junior to all the petitioners whose names appear from serial nos. 554 to 888. However, Md. Abdul Awal (serial no. 889), who is junior to the petitioners, was granted 3(three) time scales inasmuch as he was given retrospective seniority from 12.04.1992 as SAE by the Memo dated 16.08.2010. Consequentially he is now drawing salary in Grade-VIII in the pay scale of Tk. 12,000-21,600/- according to the National Pay Scale of 2009. But the petitioners, though senior to him, are now drawing salary in Grade- XI in the pay scale of Tk. 6,400-14,255/- as per the National Pay Scale of 2009. This anomalous position was created by giving Md. Abdul Awal retrospective seniority in violation of the provisions of the Recruitment Rules of 1984. Md. Abdul Awal, though entered into service earlier as TCM, could not qualify in the competitive tests for promotion as TCT and then as SAE.

The pay equalization is the right of the senior employees who are getting lower pay than that of their juniors. It is also a duty of the BTCL to ensure equal pay for all Non-Diploma SAEs in the same Gradation List. The rule of pay equalization is that pay equalization will be effective from the date the pay discrimination has taken place.

In this context, it may be recalled that the petitioners were promoted as TCTs in 1997 and SAEs on 19.11.2007. So it is abundantly clear that although Md. Abdul Awal was appointed as TCM in 1977; yet the fact remains that he was promoted as TCT and SAE after the promotion of the petitioners as TCTs and SAEs. In such a posture of things, Md. Abdul Awal became junior to the petitioners and accordingly, he is at serial no. 889 and the petitioners are at serial nos. 554-888 in the final Gradation List of Non-Diploma SAEs as evidenced by Annexure-‘C’ to the Writ Petition. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">30.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">There is no gainsaying the fact that Md.

But this benefit was not extended to the petitioners as a result of which the pay discrimination took place between the petitioners and their junior colleague Md. Abdul Awal. In order to redress this anomalous position, the BTCL attempted to equalize the pay of the petitioners with that of Md. Abdul Awal; but its attempts ended in a fiasco because of vagueness and nebulousness in the relevant orders and the objections raised thereto by the Accounts Office concerned. Thereafter the BTCL did not take any tangible step for equalization of the pay of the petitioners with that of their junior Md. Abdul Awal. In such a situation, the petitioners had to file the Writ Petition for equalization of their pay with that of Md. Abdul Awal by conceptually shifting back their date of promotion to that of Md.

Of course, the date of promotion of the majority petitioners can conceptually be shifted back to 12.04.1992; but in case of others, the date of conceptual shifting back of their promotion must be determined by the BTCL itself. The question of determination of conceptual promotion of the petitioners for the purpose of equalization of their pay with that of their junior Md. Abdul Awal is the function of the BTCL.

The non-equalization of the pay of the petitioners with that of their junior Md. Abdul Awal, as we see it, is a classic example of unfairness and betrays lack of empathy on the part of the BTCL.

He stated, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter alia,</em> that the land described in schedule No. 1 measuring an area of 11½ decimals was owned and possessed by the plaintiff, respondent herein and the land described in schedule No. 3 of the plaint measuring an area of 15 decimals was owned and possessed by the petitioner. The said 15 decimals of land is contiguous to the land of the plaintiff wherein his residence is situated, and considering comfort of both the parties they came to an agreement to exchange the aforesaid respective lands. Accordingly, on 09.07.2001 the disputed deed of exchange had been executed. But before execution of the disputed deed of exchange the defendant Pashan Ali by executing two deeds dated 03.03.1992 and 03.01.1996 transferred his 15 decimals of land to his brother Chinta Miah and by suppressing such transfer executed the disputed deed of exchange claiming the 15 decimals of land as his own. The plaintiff did not get possession of the 15 decimals of land in exchange of his 11½ decimals. After execution of the disputed deed, on query made by the plaintiff, the defendant assured him that he would hand over the exchanged land after purchasing the same from successors of his brother, but the clever defendant by two deeds purchased 7 decimals of land in the name of his son Shahidul Islam. By showing the deeds in the name of their father, the successors of the defendant’s brother claimed their title in the disputed land. On such claim a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">shalish</em> was held in presence of local elites wherein it was decided that the defendant has got title only over 10 decimals of land and he is not entitled to get further land, as such the defendant could not hand over the exchanged land to the plaintiff. The plaintiff could not realise that the defendant collusively transferred 15 decimals of land to his brother before executing the disputed deed of exchange though he had no right and title over the said 15 decimals of land and had no right to transfer or exchange the same. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">The defendant contested the suit by filing written statement denying all the material averments made in the plaint.

Subsequently, by executing deeds he transferred some land to his brother Chenu Miah, who subsequently by executing deed of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Heba-bil-Ewaz</em> No. 59 dated 03.01.1996 transferred 19 decimals of land of Plot No. 31 to the defendant. In the same manner the defendant became owner of 2 decimals of land in Plot No. 65 and 10 decimals of land in Plot No. 31 which is under his possession and ownership. This land is contiguous to the land of the plaintiff and as such the plaintiff proposed to him to exchange that land with his land, and he agreed to such proposal. As per their agreement the plaintiff’s cousin Abdul Hakim was entrusted with the duty of writing and registering the deed of exchange. On the impression that 11½ decimals of land had been transferred by the plaintiff in exchange of his aforesaid 12 decimals, he on good faith put his left thumb impression (LTI) in the disputed deed and handed over possession of 12 decimals of land to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff in collusion with his said cousin included further 3 decimals of land of C.S. Khatian Nos. 59 in the said deed, but in fact the defendant has got no right and title over the said 3 decimals of land. As per the agreement, possession of 12 decimals of land was handed over to the plaintiff, and in exchange he got 11½ decimals and has been residing therein by constructing his residence. At cost of huge money and labour he developed the quality of the suit land. Due to establishment of new bazaar in the land contiguous to his residence, the value of the disputed land has increased and the plaintiff with evil intention instituted the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New';">After hearing the parties and considering the evidence and materials on record the Senior Assistant Judge, Tangail, by the judgement and decree dated 11.09.2006 decreed the suit.

In support of his contention the defendant produced sufficient materials which are on record, but none of the Courts below went through the evidence and thus occasioned failure of justice. He submitted that the Courts below in decreeing the suit failed to appreciate the evidence on record, in particular the evidence of the defendant petitioner, wherein the plea of the defendant that the exchange deed was agreed upon to exchange .12 acre and not .15 acre in exchange of .11½ acre and the witness of the defendant though proved the same, but those are not reflected in any judgement of the Courts below and thus those are erroneous and not sustainable in law.
