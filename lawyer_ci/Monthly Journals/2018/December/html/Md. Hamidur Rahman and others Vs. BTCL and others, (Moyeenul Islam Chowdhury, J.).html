Over and above, it appears that the BTCL is not included in the Scheduled of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1981. However, assuming for the sake of argument that the petitioners are Government servants, in that event too, they are entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution for enforcement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution. Against this backdrop, we led to hold that the Writ Petition is maintainable. This Writ Petition is in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus. The petitioners have a legal right not to be discriminated against in respect of their scale of pay and the BTCL has a legal duty to ensure the equal pay of the petitioners (seniors) with their junior Md. Abdul Awal, to say the least. As the petitioners and Md. Abdul Awal are similarly situated, they must be treated alike. In a word, they cannot be dissimilarly treated at all. The petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution must not be allowed to be trampled. We are oath-bound to protect and enforce the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country. <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">      </span>. . .(34 and 35)</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Mosharraf Hossain Chowdhury Vs.

Anyway, the functions of the BTTB were taken over by the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) and the services of the petitioners were transferred to the BTCL under the provisions of section 5A(3) of the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (Amendment) Act, 2009 (Act No. 25 of 2009) which came into effect on 1<sup>st</sup> June, 2008. Under the Recruitment Rules (Officers and Employees) of the BTTB, 1984 (hereinafter referred to as the Recruitment Rules of 1984), the petitioners were required to complete 5(five) years service and qualify in the prescribed competitive tests for promotion as Telecommunication Technicians (TCTs) from TCMs. Having completed 5(five) years service and successfully passed the competitive tests, they were promoted as TCTs. Thereafter having served for another 5(five) years as TCTs and qualified in the prescribed competitive tests, they were promoted as Non-Diploma Sub-Assistant Engineers (SAEs). As many as 174 TCTs were promoted as SAEs (Batch- 15) on 19.11.2007 and another 94 TCTs were promoted as SAEs (Batch- 16) on 13.12.2007. Subsequently on completion of necessary training, a final Gradation List of Non-Diploma SAEs was published on 24.10.2011. Earlier 48 SAEs were granted seniority with retrospective effect from 12.04.1992 vide Memo No. </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: AdarshaLipiNormal;">Hpx 5-25/84-160</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> dated 16.08.2010.

One Md. Abdul Awal was granted seniority as Non-Diploma SAE with retrospective effect from 12.04.1992. His name is shown at serial no. 889 in the final Gradation List of Non-Diploma SAEs; but as per the said Gradation List, he is junior to all the petitioners whose names appear from serial nos. 554 to 888. However, Md. Abdul Awal (serial no. 889), who is junior to the petitioners, was granted 3(three) time scales inasmuch as he was given retrospective seniority from 12.04.1992 as SAE by the Memo dated 16.08.2010. Consequentially he is now drawing salary in Grade-VIII in the pay scale of Tk. 12,000-21,600/- according to the National Pay Scale of 2009. But the petitioners, though senior to him, are now drawing salary in Grade- XI in the pay scale of Tk. 6,400-14,255/- as per the National Pay Scale of 2009. This anomalous position was created by giving Md. Abdul Awal retrospective seniority in violation of the provisions of the Recruitment Rules of 1984. Md. Abdul Awal, though entered into service earlier as TCM, could not qualify in the competitive tests for promotion as TCT and then as SAE. But the respondents had granted him retrospective seniority and the higher grade of salary to the prejudice of the petitioners.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">However, in order to rectify this anomalous position, the BTCL granted equalization of pay to the petitioners vide order no. </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: AdarshaLipiNormal;">pwØq¡fe (2)/7-6/2001</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"> dated 05.05.2011.

The BTCL explained the circumstances under which the petitioners could not be promoted on time for lack of preparation of seniority list. The promotion of Batch- 15 giving retrospective effect was made on 19.11.2007 and that of Batch-16 giving retrospective effect was made on 13.12.2007 as SAEs. The pay equalization sought by the petitioners with Md. Abdul Awal is for fixation of their pay scale in Grade- VIII instead of Grade- XI in the National Pay Scale of 2009. Although the BTCL is fully competent to equalize the pay of the petitioners with that of their junior Md. Abdul Awal by conceptually shifting back their date of promotion to that of Md. Abdul Awal, yet the BTCL is not coming up to do so. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the Supplementary Affidavit dated 26.02.2014 filed on behalf of the petitioners, it has been averred that the promotion of a group of 35 Non-Diploma SAEs was given retrospective effect by an office order dated 24.10.2011.

The promotion of as many as 48 Non-Diploma SAEs was given retrospective effect from 12.04.1992 in accordance with the Gradation List of the feeder posts of those SAEs and they were senior to the petitioners. Besides, the promotion of some of those 48 Non-Diploma SAEs was given retrospective effect on the basis of the judgment passed by the Administrative Tribunal, Dhaka in Administrative Tribunal Case No. 102 of 1984. As those 48 Non-Diploma SAEs were senior to the petitioners in the feeder posts and in view of the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal passed in Administrative Tribunal Case No. 102 of 1984, a Committee was formed by the BTCL. According to the recommendation of that Committee, those 48 Non-Diploma SAEs were given promotion with retrospective effect from 12.04.1992. As originally Md. Abdul Awal was senior to the petitioners, their pay can not be equalized with that of Md.

It is for the BTCL to fix up a conceptual date of the last promotion of the petitioners in order to equalize their pay with that of their juniors. Therefore, it is reasonably believed by the petitioners that if their last promotion date is conceptually shifted back like that of their juniors to 12.04.1992, their pay will be equalized. The petitioners are not seeking any direction for promotion as Non-Diploma SAEs. They were already promoted as SAEs long before filing of the Writ Petition. They are seeking a direction to equalize their pay with that of their juniors. The petitioners have prayed for equalization of their pay with that of their juniors by way of enforcing their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Assuming for the sake of argument (but not conceding) that the petitioners are Government servants, even then the Writ Petition is maintainable for enforcement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution. The pay equalization is the right of the senior employees who are getting lower pay than that of their juniors. It is also a duty of the BTCL to ensure equal pay for all Non-Diploma SAEs in the same Gradation List. The rule of pay equalization is that pay equalization will be effective from the date the pay discrimination has taken place. In the instant case, as the petitioners are getting much lower pay than that of their juniors since 03.10.2010 because of the laches of the BTCL, they are legally entitled to have their pay fixed in Grade- VIII of the National Pay Scale of 2009 effective from 03.10.2010.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the Supplementary Affidavit-in-Opposition dated 11.07.2018 filed by the BTCL (respondent no. 1), it has been mentioned that Md.

Of course, the date of promotion of the majority petitioners can conceptually be shifted back to 12.04.1992; but in case of others, the date of conceptual shifting back of their promotion must be determined by the BTCL itself.

By no stretch of imagination, this Writ Court can usurp the functions of the BTCL in this respect. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">32.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">As to the submission of Ms. Quamrun Nessa that the pay discrimination occurred when the BTCL issued the office order dated 16.08.2010 giving retrospective effect to the promotion of as many as 48 SAEs including Md. Abdul Awal and upgrading their pay scale in Grade- VIII of the National Pay Scale of 2009 with effect from 03.10.2010 and since the petitioners did not challenge the legality of this office order dated 16.08.2010, the Writ Petition is not maintainable, we hold that the petitioners are not required to challenge the legality of the office order dated 16.08.2010 for the simple reason that they are not seeking promotion as SAEs; rather they are already SAEs by way of promotion. What we are driving at boils down to this: the petitioners are seeking a direction from the High Court Division for equalization of their pay with that of their junior Md. Abdul Awal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">33.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">We further note that after issuance of the Rule, an order of equalization of pay was implemented by the Accounts Office on 31.07.2013 for 35 Non-Diploma SAEs (senior to Md. Abdul Awal) who did not join the instant proceeding. But the case of the petitioners was not considered as the Rule has been pending in this Court for adjudication.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">34.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It goes without saying that the petitioners are the employees of the BTCL by operation of law. We have already observed that the BTCL is fully and wholly a Government-owned company. With regard to the issue of maintainability of the Writ Petition, there is a catena of authorities that the Writ Petitions filed by the employees of the wholly Government-owned companies are maintainable. In this connection, a reference may be made to the case of Zahir Akhter (Md) and 44 others Vs. Bangladesh Biman Corporation and another reported in 61 DLR (HCD) 446. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">35.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The petitioners being employees of a 100% Government-owned company, namely, BTCL can not be <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ipso facto</em> dubbed as Government servants. Over and above, it appears that the BTCL is not included in the Schedule of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1981. However, assuming for the sake of argument that the petitioners are Government servants, in that event too, they are entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution for enforcement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution. Against this backdrop, we are led to hold that the Writ Petition is maintainable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">36.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">This Writ Petition is in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus. The petitioners have a legal right not to be discriminated against in respect of their scale of pay and the BTCL has a legal duty to ensure the equal pay of the petitioners (seniors) with their junior Md. Abdul Awal, to say the least. As the petitioners and Md. Abdul Awal are similarly situated, they must be treated alike. In a word, they can not be dissimilarly treated at all. The petitioners’ fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27, 29 and 31 of the Constitution must not be allowed to be trampled. We are oath-bound to protect and enforce the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">37.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">From the foregoing discussions and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we further hold that the principle of equal pay for equal work is attracted in this case. It does not stand to reason and logic as to why the BTCL repeatedly failed to equalize the pay of the petitioners with that of Md. Abdul Awal. The non-equalization of the pay of the petitioners with that of their junior Md. Abdul Awal, as we see it, is a classic example of unfairness and betrays lack of empathy on the part of the BTCL. How can the senior SAEs, namely, the petitioners work with a sense of devotion and dedication when admittedly they have been getting lower pay than that of their junior colleague Md. Abdul Awal? This phenomenon can not be overlooked and disregarded in any view of the matter. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">It is the admitted position that the added respondent nos. 4-29 are Diploma-holder SAEs and the petitioners and those 48 SAEs including Md. Abdul Awal are Non-Diploma SAEs. So it seems that they are necessarily two separate and distinct classes by themselves. Given this panorama, the respondent nos. 4-29 and other Diploma-holder SAEs, if any, have not been rightly included in the final Gradation List of Non-Diploma SAEs as evidenced by Annexure-‘C’ to the Writ Petition. Consequently any decision of this Writ Petition will not in any way affect the interest of the respondent nos. 4-29.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">In view of the discussions made above and regard being had to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to dispose of the Rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">40.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">Accordingly, the Rule is disposed of without any order as to costs.
