He is conscious of his duty as a citizen in consonance with Article 21 of the Constitution. He desires to ensure that the foreign shipping companies and airlines pay all taxes that all are legitimately due to the national exchequer and that there is no evasion of taxes of any kind by them. The petitioner has a special interest to see that the national interest is upheld, rule of law prevails and public functionaries are doing what the law requires them to do. Anyway, the petitioner noticed several news items in some national dailies between October, 2012 and June, 2013 which raised issues about how various shipping and airline companies and their agents were breaching the laws of Bangladesh and were siphoning off a huge amount of foreign exchange from Bangladesh by using various devices and providing false information to the authorities as evidenced by Annexures- ‘A-1’ to ‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition. The foreign shipping companies and airlines, namely, the respondent nos. 9, 11 and 14 operating in Bangladesh are involved in money laundering and tax evasion in collaboration with their local and foreign agents, namely, the respondent nos. 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17 often using a web of companies and individuals and other devices. The petitioner also noticed from the news items that the named shipping companies and airlines were paying only a part of the commission to their local agents and sending the remaining portions to their countries thereby evading taxes and laundering the amounts siphoned off. Almost in all cases, the foreign shipping and airline companies are providing substantially less commission to their local agents than the 5% commission which is required to be paid under the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions, 2009 (Volume-1) published by Bangladesh Bank. It is evident from the news items that the respondent no. 3 (BFIU) of Bangladesh Bank has conducted inquiries into money laundering activities of various foreign shipping and airline companies in collusion with their local counterparts in Bangladesh and unearthed information that in most cases, the foreign shipping companies are paying commission to their agents less than the 5% commission required under the aforesaid Guidelines. The remaining sums are being laundered from Bangladesh resulting in loss of taxes on the laundered money. BFIU has apparently made inquiries in respect of the business and dealings of the respondent no. 9, Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL) which is the foreign principal of the respondent no. 10, Continental Traders (BD) Limited. From the news reports, it has been found that the respondent no. 10 is claimed to have been paid Tk. 13,50,00,000/- only as commission during 2010-2011 fiscal year. However, it transpires from the audit and tax documents that the OOCL paid only Tk. 6,70,00,000/- to the Continental Traders (BD) Limited (respondent no. 10) as commission. It has also been found by the BFIU that the OOCL in collaboration with its Bangladeshi agent (respondent no. 10) laundered US$ 8,50,000 equivalent to approximately Tk. 6,50,00,000/- only during the fiscal year 2010-2011 and evaded taxes thereon. On further inquiries made by the petitioner, it has been revealed that the respondent no. 10 earned ocean freight to the tune of US$ 37,735,825 equivalent to BDT 2,71,07,33,053/- only during the period from July, 2010 to June, 2011. On that sum, the respondent no. 10 paid freight tax on account of the OOCL at 8% amounting to BDT 21,68,58,644/- only. The agency commission payable under the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions is 5% if the entire cargo is booked by the Continental Traders (BD) Limited as an agent and 2.5% if the entire cargo is booked by the principal, that is to say, OOCL. Therefore the highest agency commission, if booked by the Continental Traders (BD) Limited, on the freight earned by the OOCL as disclosed in the Freight Tax Calculations for 2010-2011 would be US$ 18,86,791 equivalent to BDT 13,55,36,653/- only and the lowest commission, if booked by the OOCL, would be US$ 9,43,396 equivalent to BDT 6,77,68,326/- only. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The Chittagong Port Authority publishes Annual Import and Export Reports showing the volume in TEUs for each of the Main Line Operator (MLO) importing and exporting goods through the port. These reports show that the import volume of the OOCL for the calendar year 2010 was 49,750 TEUs and for the calendar year 2011 was 53,245 TEUs. Since the freight tax figures are available until the end of the accounting year of the OOCL (30<sup>th</sup> June) which have been used for calculating the commission of export freight, the petitioner has computed the average TEUs carried in those two years (2010 and 2011) for the import volume as 51,498 TEUs. The freight rates available from the industry sources for 2010 and 2011 show that the average freight into the Chittagong Port was US$ 800 per TEU. On this basis, the total freight earned would be US$ 4,11,98,400 only. There was substantial undeclared commission which amounted to US$ 11,29,186 equivalent to BDT 8,11,14,491/- only if the export cargo was booked by the Continental Traders (BD) Limited and US$ 1,85,791 equivalent to BDT 1,33,46,165/- only if all the export cargo was booked by the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>OOCL. Besides, the accounts of the Continental Traders (BD) Limited show that the container handling charge was paid by the Continental Traders (BD) Limited which, according to the standard practice, is an expense which the Principal (OOCL) should have borne. The sum of US$ 3,02,781 equivalent to BDT 2,17,50,105/- only was wrongly borne by the local agent Continental Traders (BD) Limited under this head. So it is clear that in 2010 and 2011, the OOCL and the Continental Traders (BD) Limited did not declare commission in actual amounts as earned and the Continental Traders (BD) Limited took the responsibility for the container handling charge and allowed the OOCL to receive the sum in breach of the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions. According to the above analysis and calculation, the maximum sum that was lost to Bangladesh in foreign exchange is US$ 14,31,967 equivalent to BDT 10,28,64,596/- only and the minimum is US$ 4,88,571 equivalent to BDT 3,50,96,270/- only. Over and above, for the years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, the Continental Traders (BD) Limited defrauded the public exchequer of a prodigious amount of money on freight tax count. As the Continental Traders (BD) Limited did not file its returns and accounts for these years with the respondent no. 8, it is not possible to calculate the sum in foreign exchange which was lost to Bangladesh or the tax dodged for those years (2011-2012 and 2012-2013). Because of the illegal activities of the OOCL and its Bangladeshi agent (Continental Traders (BD) Limited), Bangladesh is facing two adverse consequences: first, it is losing foreign exchange and secondly, it is losing taxes due from their business. This requires a full-scale investigation by the concerned agencies. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">According to the news report in “The Daily Ittefaq” dated 11.06.2013 (Annexure-‘A-1’ to the Writ Petition), the respondent no. 13 is one of the major conglomerates of Sri Lanka.

These documents are required for an exhaustive investigation to be carried out regarding the total export and import volumes, the freight earned for imports and exports and the commission payable contractually and actually paid. The business of the respondent no. 12 (GBX Logistics Limited) in the past was and currently is being run or managed by Aitken Spence Shipping Limited through a Sri Lankan national, namely, Mr. Bevin Mack, who concurrently holds the position of the Chief Operating Officer of GBX Logistics Limited while remaining as the Deputy General Manager of the respondent no. 13 Atiken Spence Shipping Limited in Sri Lanka.

Speed Air Cargo Net (Pvt.) Limited (respondent no. 16) has been managing this business through one of its senior employees Mr. I. M. Shumaiz who regularly receives salaries and other financial benefits from the respondent no. 16 and other companies in Sri Lanka. His P.F is being deposited to his Sri Lankan Central P.F on a regular basis by the respondent no. 16 and other associated companies. There are other companies including the respondent no. 17 which have been referred to in the news report of the Amader Shomoy. These companies have common ownership and common directors and seem to be operating in multiple jurisdictions. These companies are all part of the same device to hide the unlawful activities in breaching the foreign exchange and tax laws. The aforementioned activities of the respondents concerned are punishable offences under the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012, the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004 and the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984, as the case may be. So those respondents should be brought to book. Unfortunately the petitioner has not found any report in any news media that any action has been initiated by any of the respondent nos. 1-8 against the perpetrators of the offences of money laundering, graft and tax evasion. The respondent nos. 1-8 have miserably failed in upholding the laws of Bangladesh and in protecting its interests.

Bangladesh Bank being the regulatory body from time to time discharges its functions by conducting inspections, audits, inquiries etc. through its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). However, if any representation or complaint is lodged with Bangladesh Bank, it can employ itself to investigate the particular matter which however is not the instant case. Though as per Section 23(1)(e) of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012, BFIU has the authority to carry out on-site inspections of the organizations reported upon; but it did not conduct any such inspection and as such no report as alleged is available in this respect with Bangladesh Bank. However, after issuance of the Rule Nisi in the instant Writ Petition, BFIU, in addition to its routine inspections, collected information from the related Departments of Bangladesh Bank, namely, Foreign Exchange Policy Department, Foreign Exchange Operation Department, Foreign Exchange Inspection Department, Foreign Exchange Investment Department and from the information received from those Departments, BFIU found no irregularities or illegalities as alleged in the Writ Petition. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The respondent no. 4 is the Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission.

Besides, the instant writ proceeding is mala fide and has been initiated at the instance of a vested quarter who has embarked upon a witch-hunt and fishing expedition, especially after losing all of its foreign principal clients to others. Anyway, at one stage, the pro-forma respondent nos. 9 and 10 came to know that many allegations of money laundering had been brought against both of them by several Bangladeshi newspapers as evidenced by Annexures- ‘A-1’-‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition. Thereafter the pro-forma respondent no. 10 issued through its lawyer legal notices upon such newspapers controverting all such allegations as being based on inadequate information and inaccurate facts. But the newspapers have not till date replied to the legal notices issued by the pro-forma respondent no. 10. The method of calculation of agent commission particularly of the pro-forma respondent no. 10 resorted to by the petitioner in showing that the pro-forma respondent no. 10 did not declare before the authorities a substantial portion of money as its commission is misleading and a travesty of truth. In the first place, in calculating the amount of commission earned on export freight by the pro-forma respondent no. 10 during the financial year 2010-2011, the petitioner used the gross freight figure, rather than the net freight figure, as stipulated in the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions. Since the gross freight figure comprising all sub-charges is always higher than the net freight figure which does not include the sub-charges, the petitioner’s calculation of the pro-forma respondent no. 10’s commission earning from export freight is overly inflated. Secondly, in calculating the amount of commission earned by the pro-forma respondent no. 10 from import freight, the petitioner, instead of taking into account the actual freight charged by the respondent no. 9 for imports and the actual number of TEUs imported into Bangladesh by the respondent no. 9 during the financial year 2010-2011, wrongly took into account the average freight rate prevailing at the relevant time and also the average of all TEUs imported into Bangladesh by the respondent no. 9 during 2010-2011. It is pertinent to mention here that the pro-forma respondent no. 9 always decides its ocean freight on the basis of its own commercial consideration and justification and at times may be different from the ocean freight rate prevailing in the market. Therefore the figure reached by the petitioner as having been earned by the pro-forma respondent no. 10 as commission from import freight is anything but true. Further, the nature of the shipping agency business only requires the agent to remit money to its foreign principal when it is actually collected from customers locally as negotiated by the shipment contracts. A foreign principal will have to remit money from time to time to meet any payment including expenses and agency commission of its agent pursuant to its agency agreement. Bangladesh Bank being the concerned regulatory authority holds the responsibility of maintaining regulatory oversight on incoming as well as outgoing remittances. The pro-forma respondent no. 10 upon calculating its commission as per the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions prepares freight manifests for submission to Bangladesh Bank periodically through its authorized dealer, that is to say, HSBC, Bangladesh. HSBC, upon receiving such freight manifests from the pro-forma respondent no. 10, thoroughly scrutinizes the same in order to check its compliance with the applicable Rules, Regulations and/or Guidelines before sending them to Bangladesh Bank. Thereafter the Bangladesh Bank officials conduct audit based on the said freight manifests before granting its approval to the same. From the stringent nature of the aforesaid procedure, it is clear that had the pro-forma respondent no. 10 been involved in any irregularities or illegalities as alleged by the petitioner giving reference to the paper-clippings (Annexures -‘A-1’-‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition), either the HSBC or Bangladesh Bank, with the help of their highly skilled and competent officials, would have by now identified the same. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Bangladesh Bank, upon becoming aware of the allegations brought by several newspapers including the New Age that the pro-forma respondent no. 9, in collaboration with the pro-forma respondent no. 10, had laundered US$ 8,50,000 during the fiscal year 2010-2011, directed the HSBC to conduct a thorough inquiry into the affairs of the pro-forma respondent no. 10 and report its findings to Bangladesh Bank. Subsequently, the HSBC by its letter dated 16.04.2013 under Memo No. HSBC/SD/13/263 informed Bangladesh Bank that after a detailed inquiry into the records of the pro-forma respondent no. 10, it found no evidence of any such irregularities or illegalities. Therefore it is manifestly clear that the allegations brought by the petitioner by reference to the newspaper-clippings are false, fabricated and devoid of substance. The petitioner through his wrong calculation of the amount of commission earned by the pro-forma respondent no. 10 during the financial year 2010-2011 has tried to mislead the Court into believing that the pro-forma respondent no. 10, by way of under-declaring its commission, laundered vast sums of money out of the country.

Anyway, Hapag-Lloyd entered into an agency agreement with GBX Logistics Limited in 2012 under which GBX Logistics Limited has been performing its obligations as an agent of Hapag-Lloyd in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Bank by a letter dated 16.07.2013 accorded permission to GBX Logistics Limited (respondent no. 12) to act as an agent of Hapag-Lloyd in Bangladesh. On top of that, the Joint Commissioner, Chairman, Licensing Authority, Customs House, Chittagong by a letter dated 30.05.2013 issued permission to GBX Logistics Limited (respondent no. 12) to act as an agent of Hapag-Lloyd at the Chittagong Port. In Annexure-‘A-1’ to the Writ Petition, it is stated that Mr. Bevin Mack is working for GBX Logistics Limited despite the fact that he is the Deputy General Manager of a company in Sri Lanka. But Mr. Mack is not employed either by Hapag-Lloyd or any of its affiliates and therefore the respondent no. 11 is not in a position to comment on this issue.

The gist of this Affidavit-in-Compliance is as under:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>Etihad appointed GSA Cargo as its General Sales and Service Agent (GSSA) within the geographic territory of Bangladesh by entering into a valid and legally enforceable contract in the form of a ‘Cargo General Sales Agent and Service Agency Agreement’ on 01.03.2006. The Agency Agreement was renewed from time to time and ultimately its duration was provisionally extended by way of an Extension Agreement. Etihad being an International Airline having global reputation maintains independent relationships with different conglomerates all over the world and the appointments of its GSSAs cover specific geographic territories that are expressly stated in the legally enforceable contracts executed between Etihad and its agents. While GSA Gargo Limited acts as the agent of Etihad in the geographic territory of Bangladesh, the pro-forma respondent no. 16 Speed Air Cargo Net (Pvt.) Limited acts as the agent of Etihad in the geographic territory of Sri Lanka and Male. Its role as an agent of Etihad is strictly confined to Sri Lanka and Male and in no way coincides with that of GSA Cargo Limited in Bangladesh. In the premises, the statement that the pro-forma respondent no. 16 (Speed Air Cargo Net (Pvt.) Limited) of Sri Lanka is “apparently the actual agent of pro-forma respondent no. 14 in Bangladesh” is false and misleading. The newspaper-clippings annexed to the Writ Petition in this regard are ill-founded and based on conjectures, surmises, inferences and speculations. GSA Cargo Limited is not only a genuine cargo agent of Etihad in Bangladesh, but also it is the only Cargo GSSA of Etihad in the country. Therefore Etihad strongly denies any accusation as to the appointment of any sham agent in Bangladesh or having any foreign or extra-territorial agent of any type for the geographic territory of Bangladesh. Etihad requires its local GSSA in Bangladesh, that is to say, GSA Cargo Limited to obtain necessary permission under Section 18A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 from Bangladesh Bank and to keep the same up-to-date so as to ensure that the said Act is duly complied with. This respondent (respondent no. 14) maintains requisite permission from the appropriate Governmental Authorities in due compliance with all applicable provisions at all times. So any connotations with regard to the involvement of Etihad in money laundering and tax evasion, either on its own or in collaboration with any other entity, by means of using a web of companies and individuals or any other devices are manifestly misleading. The news reports annexed by the petitioner to the Writ Petition neither bring nor establish any specific allegations against Etihad as regards its involvement in money laundering or tax evasion. Those news reports do not also unveil any specific allegations or evidence to exemplify that Etihad has been paying only a part of the commission to its local agent and laundering the rest amount outside the country. Etihad has been paying to its local agent in full the precise amount of commission agreed upon in the agency agreement and has not concealed any freight earned or commission paid and declared under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Etihad being an international conglomerate has been conducting its business worldwide including Bangladesh with integrity, transparency and having regard to the laws of the respective countries. It was not a party to any inquiry procedure purportedly carried out by BFIU. However, Etihad recently received a letter bearing Memo No. ACC/S. Inq &amp; Investigation-1/M.L.P/81-2013/26098 dated 03.09.2014 from the Special Inquiry and Investigation Unit-1of the Anti-Corruption Commission requesting co-operation from it by way of providing relevant documents for proper inquiry into the allegations levelled against Mr. Helal Uddin Akbar, Managing Director of GSA Cargo Limited for conducting its business by breaching the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. As part of its endeavour to co-operate with the Anti-Corruption Commission in this respect, Etihad has been maintaining correspondences with the Anti-Corruption Commission and duly forwarded all the relevant documents to the said Commission as sought for. Etihad maintains a transparent and methodical system for transfer of all funds payable to it as the Principal and ensures due compliance with the laws, regulations and guidelines applicable to it on this account. The mechanism for transferring any fund from its GSSA in Bangladesh, namely, GSA Cargo Limited to Etihad in Abu Dhabi is closely scrutinized at all times. Etihad further maintains a meticulous internal accounting and information management system with the help of a computerized database maintained in Oracle so as to store and retrieve its accounting information with accuracy and efficiency. The said information management system, which is regularly updated and upgraded, further ensures that transfer of any fund takes place in a transparent and methodical system after it duly matches with the relevant invoice. Etihad being the pro-forma respondent no. 14 of the instant Writ Petition conforms to the relevant laws and regulations of Bangladesh in the course of its operation in Bangladesh and strictly adheres to the guidelines applicable to it. It always ensures that funds received are properly accounted for and taxes are duly paid. Etihad has no information about any known business tie between GSA Cargo Limited that is acting as its agent in Bangladesh and Speed Air Cargo Net (Pvt.) Limited which is its agent in Sri Lanka and Male. Mr. I. M. Shumaiz as referred to in paragraph 35 of the Writ Petition is not an employee of Etihad in Abu Dhabi or its Dhaka Branch Office. Lastly, as the petitioner has no sufficient interest in the matter, the Writ Petition is not maintainable and the same is an abuse of the process of the Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The respondent no. 15 GSA Cargo Limited is a Bangladeshi Agent of Etihad Cristal Cargo of Etihad Airways.

The news reports published in various national dailies annexed to the Writ Petition as Annexures- ‘A-1’-‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition are seriously prejudicial to the reputation of the community of shipping agents as a whole. The respondent no. 26 does not wish to take any blame for the alleged conduct of a few members of the Bangladesh Shipping Agents Association against whom serious allegations of money laundering have been brought. The respondent no. 26 being one of the leading trade organizations in the country prays for issuance of necessary directions upon the respondent nos. 1-7 for inspection and examination of suspicious monetary transactions of the concerned shipping agents relating to their shipping business in Bangladesh and for appropriate legal actions against them, if deemed necessary, within the purview of the relevant laws of Bangladesh. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">As against the Affidavit-of-Facts filed on behalf of the added respondent no. 26, the respondent no. 12 GBX Logistics Limited has filed an Affidavit-in-Reply the contents of which are, briefly, as follows: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>The respondent no. 12 has been made a party in this Writ Petition by the petitioner at the instance and behest of the business competitors of the respondent no. 12. The respondent no. 12 and one MGH Group are involved in similar shipping agencyship business of foreign companies in Bangladesh. Mr. Ahsanul Haque Chowdhury who represents the added respondent no. 26 is a Director of MGH Group. In his capacity as Director of MGH Group, he has made some untrue and fabricated allegations in the Affidavit-of-Facts under the umbrella of the added respondent no. 26. As a Member of the Bangladesh Shipping Agents Association Limited, the respondent no. 12 has access to the records of the Association. The alleged complaint dated 10.01.2017 lodged by one Advocate Mr. Motiur Rahman is a product of backstage maneuvers of Mr. Ahsanul Haque Chowdhury, one of the Directors of the business competitor of the respondent no. 12. The complaint was lodged mala fide in order to cause damage to the reputation and goodwill of the respondent no. 12. The alleged report of the Inquiry Committee is misconceived, misleading and indeed designed to undermine the reputation of the respondent no. 12 in the estimation of the people. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">At the outset, Mr. M.

Our Constitution is not at pari materia with the Indian Constitution on this point. The Indian Constitution, either in Article 32 or in Article 226, has not mentioned who can apply for enforcement of fundamental rights and constitutional remedies. The Indian Courts only honour a tradition in requiring that the petitioner must be an ‘aggrieved person’. The emergence of pro bono publico litigation in India, that is litigation at the instance of a public-spirited citizen espousing causes of others, has been facilitated by the absence of any constitutional provision as to who can apply for a writ. In England, various tests were applied. Sometimes it was said that a person must be ‘aggrieved’ or he must have ‘a specific legal right’ or he must have ‘sufficient interest’. Now after the introduction of the new Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 53 Rule 3, any person can apply for ‘judicial review’ in England under the Supreme Court Act, 1981 if he has ‘sufficient interest’. Therefore the decisions of the Indian jurisdiction on public interest litigations are hardly apt in our situation.

What is the meaning of this expression? The Constitution has not defined the expression, nor has it mentioned ‘personally aggrieved person’. An expression occurring in the Constitution can not be interpreted out of context or only by reference to the decisions of foreign jurisdictions where the constitutional dispensations are different from ours. In interpreting the expression ‘person aggrieved’, it can not be overlooked that the English Courts which introduced the restrictive rule of standing vastly shifted from their traditional view which was ultimately changed by legislation. The expression has to be given a meaning in the context of the scheme and objectives of the Constitution and in the light of the purpose behind the grant of the right to the individuals and the power to the Court. Any interpretation which undermines the scheme or objectives of the Constitution, or defeats the purpose for which the jurisdiction is created is to be discarded. It has to be noted that the framers of the Constitution envisioned a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice (political, economic and social) would be secured for all citizens. They spoke about their vision in the Preamble of the Constitution in no uncertain terms. To give full effect to the rule of law, substantive provision has been made in Article 7 which states that all powers in the Republic shall be exercised only under, and by the authority of, the Constitution. The vision as to the society has been re-stated in Article 8 and elaborated in other Articles of Part II. Article 8(2) specifically states that the principles of State policy set down in Part II will be fundamental to the governance of Bangladesh. To ensure the fundamental human rights, freedom, equality and justice, the Constitution has guaranteed a host of rights in Part III as fundamental rights. And to ensure that the mandate of the Constitution is obeyed, the High Court Division has been given the wide power of judicial review. In this background, can the expression ‘person aggrieved’ be given a meaning in consonance with the traditional view of ‘locus standi’ and thereby producing a result deprecated by Schwartz and Wade as inimical to a healthy system of administrative law and contrary to public interest? The Appellate Division has answered the question in the negative in the case of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque…Vs… Bangladesh, 49 DLR (AD) 1</em> (popularly known as BELA’s Case). </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">63.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The expression ‘person aggrieved’ means a person who even without being personally affected has sufficient interest in the matter in dispute.

Therefore, there will always be an element of discretion to be used by the Court in giving standing to the petitioner. From the above, it appears that the Courts of this jurisdiction have shifted their position to a great extent from the traditional rule of standing which confines access to the judicial process only to those to whom legal injuries are caused or legal wrong is done. The narrow confines within which the rule of standing was imprisoned for long years have been broken and a new dimension is being given to the doctrine of locus standi.”</span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">         </span>In the ETV Case (supra), it was further held in paragraph 74:</span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 110%; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt .5in;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">“74.

Locus standi is not a case of jurisdiction of the Court, but a case of discretion of the Court, which discretion has to be exercised on consideration of facts and law points involved in each case, as already pointed out in the case of Kazi Mukhlesur Rahman. As a matter of prudence and not a rule of law, the Court may confine its exercise of discretion, taking into consideration the facts, the nature of the public wrong or public injury, the extent of its seriousness and the relief claimed. Therefore, the concern shown by the Bar, that giving locus standi to the petitioner will open the floodgates, and the Court will soon be overburdened with cases, does not hold good.

As the statutory bodies, namely, Bangladesh Bank, Anti-Corruption Commission and National Board of Revenue did not appear to have taken any steps on the basis of the paper-clippings as evidenced by Annexures- ‘A-1’-‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition, he has just drawn the attention of this Court to the perpetration of the crimes reported upon by way of filing the Writ Petition. What we are driving at boils down to this: perpetration of criminal offences like money laundering, graft and tax evasion are, no doubt, public injuries or public wrongs. It goes without saying that when a public functionary has a public duty or owes a duty to the public in general, every citizen has sufficient interest in the performance of that public duty. So it necessarily follows that the writ-petitioner Mr. M. Quamrul Haque Siddique has sufficient interest in seeing that the perpetrators of money laundering, graft and tax evasion etc. are exposed and brought to book. He has, it transpires, has filed the Writ Petition on behalf of the citizens of the country as well as on his own behalf. So the sufficiency of interest of the writ-petitioner Mr. M.

Besides, it has also been held in the decision that the Court which is considering the question of bona fides in a particular case will have to decide as to why the affected party has not come before it and if it finds no satisfactory reason for non-appearance of such affected party, it may refuse to entertain the petition.

The alleged inaction or failure of the Anti-Corruption Commission, National Board of Revenue and Bangladesh Bank in relation to Annexures- ‘A-1’-‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition can be brought to the notice of the Court by any citizen of Bangladesh and the writ-petitioner has precisely done that in this case. By no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the instant Writ Petition is a publicity interest litigation or a private interest litigation.

By the way, it may be recalled that the rule of law is one of the basic structures of the Constitution as found by the Appellate Division in the Eighth Amendment Case (<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Anwar Hossain Chowdhury and others…Vs…Bangladesh and others, 1989 BLD (SpI) 1</em>). It is the mandate of the Constitution that there must be rule of law in the country. As the writ-petitioner has sufficient interest in the establishment of the rule of law through prevention of money laundering, graft, tax evasion etc. and punishment of the perpetrators of those crimes, we find him competent enough to claim a hearing from this Court as found by the Appellate Division in Moklesur Rahman’s Case (supra). Over and above, in the ETV Case, it has been formulated that there is always an element of discretion in the matter of granting standing to the petitioner. From the facts and circumstances of the present case before us, it transpires that the petitioner, as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, is very much concerned with the establishment of the rule of law in the country. Against this backdrop, the petitioner Mr. M. Quamrul Haque Siddique can not be stigmatized as a busybody or an interloper. Given this scenario, we can not deny his standing in filing the present Writ Petition before the High Court Division under Article 102 of the Constitution. Accordingly, we find that the Writ Petition is maintainable. As a natural corollary, the submissions of Mr. Md. Asaduzzaman and others on the question of non-maintainability of the Writ Petition stand negatived. </span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">76.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is a truism that the publication of the news items in various national dailies as evidenced by Annexures- ‘A-1’-‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition have prompted the writ-petitioner to file the Writ Petition because of the alleged inaction/failure of the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh Bank and National Board of Revenue in curbing the alleged offences of money laundering, graft, tax evasion etc. It appears from the Affidavit-in-Opposition filed by the learned Advocate Mr. Shamim Khaled Ahmed on behalf of Bangladesh Bank that BFIU did not sit idle over the matter.

In other words, no action is called for on the basis of the paper-clippings (Annexures- ‘A-1’-‘A-9’ to the Writ Petition) at the moment. Of course, the clinching of the matter both by the Anti-Corruption Commission and Bangladesh Bank for the time being will not preclude them from undertaking further inquiries into any offences of money laundering and graft. If new credible materials transpire at a subsequent stage involving the concerned respondents and others, any interested parties, if so advised, may assist the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh Bank and National Board of Revenue in unearthing and unfolding the commission of offences such as money laundering, graft, tax evasion in futuro. Those statutory bodies are always at liberty to prevent the commission of such offences and take appropriate legal steps against the perpetrators of those offences.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">82.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">A reference to the Affidavit-in-Compliance filed by the respondent no. 24 Editor of “The Daily Janata” indicates that two persons, namely, Md.

Limited. In other words, their involvement with any of these companies as per the record is not forthcoming before us. However, if those two persons, namely, Md. Mosharaf Hossain and Md. Shah Alam are found to be involved in illegal hundi business as alleged, they can not get off scot-free. The appropriate agencies must take necessary legal steps to that effect. </span></p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">83.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">In the facts and circumstances of the case and with the observations made in the body of the judgment, the Rule is discharged without any order as to costs. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 110%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Ed. </span></strong></p><div style="mso-element: footnote-list;"><br clear="all"/><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><div id="ftn1" style="mso-element: footnote;"><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1;" title=""><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Writ Petition</span></strong></a><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> No. 5579 of 2014</span></strong></p></div></div></div></div>
