While for carrying out investigation by the police officers, there are prescribed provisions in the CrPC and the Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, there is no such statutory procedural provisions or Apex Court’s guidelines in place for conducting a Judicial Enquiry. From the perspective of criminal proceedings, while the statutory source of commencing a Judicial Enquiry is Section 202 of the CrPC, Section 539B of the CrPC provides the extent of activities of a Judicial Enquiry. Therefore, Judicial Enquiry in connection with criminal proceedings means an enquiry of complaint of any offence ordered by a Judicial Magistrate to be carried out by the same Judicial Magistrate or by another Judicial Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint and, in ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint, the Enquiring Magistrate may do anything which s/he considers to be relevant and appropriate, including taking evidence of witnesses on oath under Section 202(2A) CrPC and visiting/inspecting the crime spot and other place/s, as mandated by Section 539B of the CrPC.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">                               </span>. . .

Aynul Hoque alias Abdul Mannan, as the informant, lodged an FIR alleging, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">inter-alia</em>, that on 10.05.2009 at about 08.30 hours his son Ahsan Habib Pinu (hereinafter referred to as the victim) went to the local Bazar and when the victim was not returning home, the informant and other relatives rushed to every possible places and, eventually, a 12-year old minor boy, who is a distant grandson of the informant, found the head of the victim floating in the latrine of one Md. Liaqat Ali and therefrom they pulled out the dead body of the victim. The informant alleged in the FIR that there was a long-standing dispute over establishment of an educational institution between the informant and Liakat Ali and, for which, the informant suspects that (1) Md. Liakat Ali along with (2) Md Bablu Mia, (3) Md. Manik Mia, (4) Md Ruhul Amin and (5) Md Rakibul Islam killed his son and hid the dead body in the latrine. Upon receiving the above FIR, the police investigated the matter and submitted charge-sheet on 29.03.2010 under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code against Md. Babul Mia and Harunur Rashid and, at the same time, final report was presented in favour of four FIR-named accused, including Md. Liakat Ali, which prompted the informant to file a Naraji Petition. On considering the averments of the said Naraji Petition, the Court on 02.08.2010 ordered for conducting a Judicial Enquiry by a Judicial Magistrate. Accordingly, a Judicial Magistrate from the judicial magistracy at the District of Gaibandha (hereinafter referred to as the Enquiring Magistrate), after conducting the Judicial Enquiry, on 30.11.2011 came up with the same findings as were recorded by the police and, then, the learned Senior Judicial Magistrate, Gaibandha (hereinafter referred to as the cognizance-taking Magistrate) took cognizance against 2 (two) charge-sheeted accused persons and discharged the other not-sent-up four accused persons vide his order dated 24.07.2012. Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the same, the informant filed a revisional application before the Senior Sessions Judge, Gaibandha who dismissed the revisional application upholding the Order passed by the Senior Judicial Magistrate, <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Gaibandha. Challenging the legality and propriety</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">of the above two Orders, the informant-petitioner</span> approached this Court under Section 561A of the CrPC and hence the Rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Mr. Sarwar Ahmed, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the informant-petitioner, takes us through the FIR and, side by side, the statements made by the Judicial Witnesses (JWs) and submits that while the FIR merely contains the suspicion by the informant against Md. Liakat Ali, Md. Babul Miah, Md. Manik Miah, Md. Ruhul Amin and Raqibul Islam, the statements of JWs clearly suggest that they were involved in the murder. He, then, draws our attention to the report prepared by the Enquiring Magistrate and submits that the Enquiring Magistrate, having not judiciously evaluated the statements of the JWs and having<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>come to the conclusion that nothing was found against Md. Liakat Ali and his<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>3 cohorts, committed a serious illegality. He next submits that the cognizance-taking Magistrate utterly failed to perform his duty in <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">having his own satisfaction and to independently</span> decide as to whether cognizance should be taken against the non-proposed accused. In support of his above count of submissions, he refers to the cases of Anwaruddin Molla Vs Hamid Molla 18 DLR 295 and Md. Akbar Hossain Vs Hasanul Hoque Inu 11 BLT (AD) 166. Mr. Sarwar Ahmed, thereafter, takes us through the Judgment passed by the learned Sessions Judge in disposing of the revisional application and submits that the revisional application was disposed of in a perfunctory manner without applying his judicial mind and comments that it is simply unbefitting for a Senior Sessions Judge to write such a Judgment, given that the same is nothing but a mere replication of the Order passed by the learned Magistrate. Mr. Sarwar Ahmed submits that since, in this case, anyone with ordinary prudence upon considering the JWs’ statements would be of the view that there is <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">a prima facie</em> case against the FIR-named suspected persons, this Court, instead of remanding the case to the cognizance-taking Magistrate for further enquiry, should direct the Magistrate to take cognizance against all the suspected persons straightaway. In response to a query made by this Court as to whether this Court is competent to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance, he professes that since the present application is not under Section 436 of the CrPC but under Section 561A of the CrPC, this is a unique case where this Court is amply empowered to straightaway direct the Magistrate concerned to take cognizance of the offence against the not-sent-up accused. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">By making the above submissions, the learned Advocate for the petitioner prays for setting aside the Judgment and Order dated 09.01.2014 passed by the learned Senior Sessions Judge, Gaibandha in Criminal Revision No. 271 of 2012 and, also, the Judgment and Order dated 24.07.2012 passed by the learned Senior Judicial Magistrate, Gaibandha in G.R.

It would be profitable for adjudication upon this issue, if we try to be acquainted with the terms ‘Enquiry’ and ‘Judicial Enquiry’, at first. While the definition of the term ‘enquiry’ is available, having been provided in Section 4(1)(k) of the CrPC in the following wordings <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“every enquiry other than a trial conducted under this Code by a Magistrate or Court”</em>, there is no such <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">statutory definition of the phraseology “Judicial</span> Enquiry”. The Black’s Law Dictionary inscribes the meaning of the phraseology “Judicial Enquiry” in the following wordings <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“an official in-Court investigation of events, facts and actions to address a question of law and render an opinion”.</em> Commonly, Judicial Enquiry is known to be an enquiry, of any accident or crime, carried out by a Judge or Judicial Magistrate upon being directed by a Court of law/by the President of the Country/by the Parliament/by the Cabinet/by the Prime Minister. While for carrying out investigation by the police officers, there are prescribed provisions in the CrPC and the Police Regulations of Bengal, 1943, there is no such statutory procedural provisions or Apex Court’s guidelines in place for conducting a Judicial Enquiry. From the perspective of criminal proceedings, while the statutory source of commencing a Judicial Enquiry is Section 202 of the CrPC, Section 539B of the CrPC provides the extent of activities of a Judicial Enquiry. Therefore, Judicial Enquiry in connection with criminal proceedings means an enquiry of complaint of any offence ordered by a Judicial Magistrate to be carried out by the same Judicial Magistrate or by another Judicial Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint and, in ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint, the Enquiring Magistrate may do anything which s/he considers to be relevant and appropriate, including taking evidence of witnesses on oath under Section 202(2A) CrPC and visiting/inspecting the crime spot and other place/s, as mandated by Section 539B of the CrPC. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">The Enquiring Magistrate, at the end of carrying out a Judicial Enquiry, is required to prepare a Judicial Enquiry Report on the basis of the statements made by the JWs together with their remarks/comments about the demeanour of the JWs, if any demeanour is ever noticed by the Enquiring Magistrate, as well as the findings and observations on other step/s taken by the Enquiring Magistrate, such as visiting the place of occurrence under Section 539B of the CrPC, taking snaps of the place of occurrence and the injury on the body, etc. In course of preparation of a Judicial Enquiry Report, the Enquiring Magistrate should seek to form her/his own opinion without being influenced by the findings and proposals made by the IO in the report submitted under Section 173 of the CrPC and the same should be forwarded to the Chief Metropolitan/Judicial Magistrate who, then her/himself, or any other Magistrate assigned by the CMM/CJM, would independently consider the issue of taking cognizance under Section 190 CrPC or dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 CrPC upon examining all the materials of the police report, namely, FIR, sketch map, index, seizure list, medical certificate, post-mortem report &amp; inquest report (in case of any homicidal offence), the statements made by the witnesses under Sections 161 &amp; 164 of the CrPC, the statements/confessions made by the accused under Section 164 of the CrPC, case diary, for, the police report under Section 190 (1)(b) of the CrPC does not mean only the report prepared by the IO, but it also includes all the materials mentioned above, and, also, upon examining all the materials of the Judicial Enquiry Report, which includes the statements of the JWS, together with the remarks on the demeanour of the JWs, findings and observations on the seized goods/articles seen by the own eyes of the Enquiring Magistrate, on the crime spot/other places visited and inspected under Section 539B CrPC and other incriminating materials. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Now, let us look at the facts of this case. From a minute perusal of the annexed papers, it transpires that the FIR was lodged on 11.05.2009 under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code against 5 (five) suspected persons namely, (i) Md. Liakat Ali (ii) Md. Bablu Mia (iii) Md. Manik Mia (iv) Md. Ruhul Amin and (v) Md. Rakibul Islam and, after the investigation, the Investigating Officer (IO) on 29.03.2010 while proposing to prosecute Md. Babul Mia and another person, named, Md. Harun Ur Rashid who was not named in the FIR, recommended to release other 4 suspected persons. When the informant filed a Naraji application, the learned Magistrate vide his Order dated 02.08.2010 ordered a Judicial Enquiry. Upon skimming through the materials of the Judicial Enquiry, it appears that the learned Enquiring Magistrate did not visit and inspect the place of occurrence or did not make any effort to take evidence from any witnesses other than those witnesses whose names were furnished by the complainant.

The function of taking cognizance by a Judicial Magistrate is an important step in our criminal justice system and, in taking cognizance, while, in a CR case, a Judicial Magistrate is duty bound to examine and consider the complaint petition, statements, made by the complainant under Section 200 CrPC and if there is a Judicial Enquiry, then, the Judicial Enquiry Report and, likewise,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>in the GR case, the FIR, the statements made by the witnesses under Sections 161 &amp; 164 CrPC, the statements made by the accused under Section 164 CrPC, the police report and the other incriminating materials, but s/he is not bound by the findings and recommendations of <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">the police report or the Judicial Enquiry Report,</span> for, the law envisages that the cognizance-taking Magistrate shall be completely independent in having the primary satisfaction as to whether there is any <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> evidence of commission of offence by any accused for taking cognizance. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">14.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">In other words, when a criminal case is filed in the Police Station by lodging an FIR and, after investigation of the said case, the Investigating Officer (IO) submits a police report recommending for prosecuting or discharging any accused person, the Magistrate is not bound by the recommendation made by the IO for discharging any accused; rather the Magistrate is at liberty to take cognizance of any offence against any person either on the basis of the materials available before the Magistrate, such as, the police report or on the basis of his own knowledge/suspicion or information received from any person other than a police officer under Section 190 (1)(b) or under Section 190 (1)(c) of the CrPC, as the case may be. And, when a criminal case is filed through Court by presenting a petition of complaint/oral complaint before a Magistrate, the Magistrate is at liberty either to take cognizance directly under Section 190 (1)(a) of the CrPC on the basis of the statements made by the complainant under Section 200 CrPC or, <span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt;">in the event that the complaint is sent for Judicial</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;"> Enquiry, on the basis of Judicial Enquiry</span> Report. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">However, in a GR case, after submission of the police report by the IO when a Naraji petition (complaint petition) is filed and the Magistrate directs for Judicial Enquiry, then, upon receiving the Judicial Enquiry Report, the Magistrate is at liberty to take cognizance either on the basis of the Judicial Enquiry Report, treating the same as <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">‘information received from any person other than a police officer’</em> under Section 190 (1)(c) of the CrPC or on the basis of his own knowledge/suspicion under Section 190 of the CrPC or on the basis of the police report under Section 190 (1)(b) of the CrPC or on the basis of complaint (Naraji petition) under Section 190 (1)(a) of the CrPC following finding <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima-facie</em> truthfulness as to the allegation made in the complaint petition through carrying out Judicial Enquiry. It is to be borne in mind by the learned cognizance-taking Magistrates of the land that the only source of the power of taking cognizance of any offence by the Magistrates of Bangladesh is Section 190 of the CrPC and, therefore, at the time of taking cognizance, it is a pivotal duty for a Magistrate to see whether taking cognizance of any offence fits into or relates to any of the clauses of sub-Section (1) of Section 190 of the CrPC. Thus, a Judicial Magistrate or <span style="letter-spacing: -.2pt;">an Executive Magistrate having been empowered</span> to take cognizance by the Government under Section 190(4) of the CrPC is competent to take cognizance of any offence against any person in addition to the person recommended by the IO and/or the Enquiring Magistrate resorting to any of the provisions which are enumerated under sub-Section (1) of Section 190 of the CrPC. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In this case, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code only against two persons and discharged others simply saying that <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“in view of the Judicial Enquiry Report cognizance under Sections 302/201/34 of the Penal Code is taken against the sent-up accused in c/s”.</em> Evidently, the learned Magistrate did a stereotyped job, for, there is no effort on his part to assess the statements of the JWs by himself independently and thereby form his own view as to whether any statements have been made by the JWs implicating the persons who have been named in the petition of complaint. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">The proposition of law, as emanates from our research, that after receiving the Judicial Enquiry Report, when the Magistrate is going to pass an order on taking cognizance of any offence against any person/s under Section 190 (1) of the CrPC or dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 of the CrPC, it is incumbent upon the Magistrate to examine and consider the nitty-gritty of the Judicial Enquiry Report.

It is pertinent to record here that when this Court had asked the learned Advocate for the informant-petitioner for not taking any step for disposal of the Rule, in reply thereto, it was contended that the petitioner was reluctant to proceed with the enquiry and trial of this case during the period the learned Senior Sessions Judge is stationed at Gaibandha Judgeship, for, he was simply counting his time to go on <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">retirement and was not conscientiously performing</span> his duties. Some other derogatory comments about the quality of his performance, which had been performed just before his retirement, were also heard from the Bar, but those are ignored to register here.

More so, from the manner and style of handing down this impugned Judgment by none other than a Senior Sessions Judge of the State, this Court puts it on record that the performance he has demonstrated in dealing with this petty matter is below the quality that this State deserves from a judicial officer who is at the helm of the judicial functions of a District, for, the Judgment and Order passed by him is merely a replication of the Order passed by the cognizance-taking Magistrate and there was not even a minimum effort from his part to scrutinize as to whether the cognizance-taking Magistrate assessed the statements of the JWs independently of the Enquiring Magistrate’s view, let alone examining the aspect of accuracy of the Judicial Enquiry conducted by the Enquiring Magistrate or appropriateness of preparation of Judicial Enquiry Report by the Enquiring Magistrate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Now, following resolution of this Court that both the impugned Orders are liable to be quashed, what becomes the present status of this case and what is the next course of action to be taken by the Court below; (i) should there be an order by this Court to conduct further enquiry under Section 436 of the CrPC or (ii) by exercising the power of this Court under Section 561A CrPC, should it be sent back to the learned CJM to consider afresh the Judicial Enquiry Report upon independently analyzing the statements of the JWs or (iii) should this Court direct the cognizance-taking Magistrate to take cognizance against the persons whose complicity in the alleged offence is apparent from the JWs, exercising its inherent power under Section 561A of the CrPC? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">21.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Section 436 of the CrPC is placed within Chapter XXXII, which mainly consists of Sections 435, 436, 439 &amp; 439A, under the caption “Of Reference and Revision”.

In an effort to substantiate the above submissions, the cases of Bangladesh Vs Yakub Sardar 40 DLR (AD) 246 and Yousuf A Hossain Vs KM Rezaul Firdous 48 DLR (AD) 53 have been referred to by the learned Advocate for the accused. Let us discuss the facts and legal issues of the cited cases. In the case of Yusuf A. Hasan Vs Rezaul Firdous 48 DLR (AD) 53, the accused was a Government servant and when he had written about the complainant’s corruption to his higher authority, the complainant filed a defamation case under Section 500 of the Penal Code. Since the accused had done it in his official capacity, the law requires that the complainant must obtain approval from the Government for filing this kind of case. Thus, there was no scope for the Magistrate to take cognizance against the accused without, first, seeing the Government’s sanction to prosecute the accused and, consequently, the complaint was dismissed and, in course of adjudication of the matter by the Appellate Division, the Apex Court, while upholding the order of dismissal of the complaint petition did not order for further enquiry into the complaint, made an observation that neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court Division can direct the Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence. In the other referred case, namely, Bangladesh Vs Yakub Sarder 40 DLR(AD) 246, the issue before the Apex Court was, whether the Sessions Judge is empowered to direct a Magistrate to send the case to him for trial when the Magistrate dismissed the complaint under Section 203 of the CrPC. In disposing of the case, while the Apex Court found it a proper case to direct for further enquiry into the complaint, however, in Paragraph 8 of this Judgment, the Apex Court indicated that had the High Court Division exercised its inherent power, there would have an occasion to examine the issue as to whether the High Court Division is competent to direct the Magistrate to issue summon against the accused towards sending the accused to the trial Court. Thus, the facts of the afore-referred cases<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>being different from the facts of this case and, more importantly, the issues taken up by the Apex Court for adjudication in the afore-cited cases being not similar, the ‘<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio’</em> laid down therein is not applicable in this case. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 112%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">23.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 112%;">While it is a settled principle of law, which is being consistently followed by us, that in an appropriate criminal revisional application, direction of further enquiry should be made by the Sessions Judge or the High Court Division upon receiving an application under Section 436 of the CrPC into any complaint which has been dismissed under Section 203 or 204(3) of the CrPC, or into the case of any person who has been discharged from an offence, however, in this case, since the informant/complainant did not have the scope of approaching this Court invoking its revisional jurisdiction for revising the Order passed by the Magistrate, does he deserve an order of further enquiry into his complaint under Section 561A of the CrPC? The answer thereto now requires to be searched, for, the present application, has been filed under Section 561A of the CrPC and the same being maintainable, as has been held in the case of Syed Ehsan Abdullah Vs State 2017(1) L&amp;J 135 by this Court after revisiting scores of case-laws of our jurisdiction and that of the sub-continent, the inherent power of this Court may well be invoked for securing the ends of justice, either to order for further enquiry or for fresh consideration of the materials available before the Magistrate or for directing to take cognizance of the offence against the accused who have not been proposed to be prosecuted by the IO and also by the Enquiring Magistrate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Now, let us see what types of ends of justice would be met if this Court directs for further enquiry.

It follows that there may be an order by this Court to the CJM for consideration of the statements of the JWs afresh in an expectation to judiciously assess the said statements and thereby independently pass an order, either, of taking cognizance of the offence against the persons named in the police report &amp; Judicial Enquiry Report together with the persons named in the petition of complaint, or, of being in agreement with the recommendations made by the IO and the Enquiring Magistrate dropping off the names of the four accused. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Now, a pertinent question comes up for consideration by this Court as to what would <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">happen if the new cognizance-taking Magistrate</span> passes the same order which was passed by the previous cognizance-taking Magistrate. The answer is that the informant is to approach this Court again and, pursuant thereto, this Court also would pass the same order again. So, ultimately, there would be repeated exercise at <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">the cost of putting the informant at harassments.</span> With the above hypothetical scenario, the question that pops-up is that is this Court helpless in this kind of situation to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance against the persons whose complicity in the alleged murder is apparently evident in the statements of the JWs or the statements made by the witnesses under Sections 161 &amp; 164 of the CrPC or by the accused under Section 164 of the CrPC or in any other prosecution materials? </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">The power of taking cognizance of an offence against any accused is vested in the Magistrates by the Legislature vide Section 190 of the CrPC and, therefore, it is the Magistrate who should be satisfied as to whether cognizance is to be taken or not against any person, be s/he is recommended by the IO/Enquiring Magistrate or not and, thus, the function of taking cognizance being the exclusive business of the Magistrates, passing an order of direction upon the Magistrate to take cognizance is beyond the competence of the Sessions Judge and High Court Division in exercising their appellate or revisional jurisdiction. However, by exercising the power under Section 561A of the CrPC, in a fit and proper case, which may be found in the rarest of rare cases, the High Court Division is well competent to direct the Magistrate to take cognizance towards securing the ends of justice. For example, from the prosecution materials when any one with ordinary prudence would be able to sum up that 1+1 becomes 2, making the above result to be 1.50 or 2.50 by a Magistrate would be a perverse decision and, in that scenario, interference by the High Court Division exercising its inherent power would be quite justified. Similarly, when it is vividly discernible from the evidence available before the Magistrate that s/he did not have any option other than to take cognizance of an offence against any accused, passing an order of non-prosecuting the said accused will be a perverse one. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">27.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">          </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">After carrying out careful examination of the provisions of Sections 190, 200, 202, 203, 204, 435, 436, 439, 439A and 561A of the CrPC, we are of the view that upon receiving the Naraji petition against the police report if a Judicial Enquiry is conducted and on consideration of the police report, Judicial <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">Enquiry Report and other prosecution materials,</span> the Magistrate does not take cognizance of an offence against any accused by dismissing the Naraji petition (complaint) wholly/partly under Section 203 of the CrPC and the informant-complainant seeks to revise the order directly from the High Court Division without preferring a revision before the Court of Sessions Judge, the High Court Division’s proper order would be to direct further enquiry. But when the informant-complainant takes recourse to the inherent power under Section 561A of the CrPC, irrespective of the fact whether the petitioner invoked the inherent power directly or after exhausting the revisional forum of the Court of Sessions Judge, on the ground that there is no need for further enquiry in the backdrop of availability of the evidence already obtained through Judicial Enquiry, the High Court Division is not powerless to direct the CJM or the concerned Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence against any accused against whom <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> evidence is very much evident in the Judicial Enquiry Report subject to the condition that the High Court Division is satisfied that the order of the Magistrate in dismissing the Naraji (complaint) entirely/ partly was perverse or ex-facie wrong being manifestly at variance with the evidence which the Enquiring Magistrate obtained. The rationale behind holding the above view is that when the informant, upon disagreeing with the outcome of the investigation by the police, opts for Judicial Enquiry and the Judicial Enquiry reveals commission of an offence against the accused named in the complaint petition, but the Magistrate does not take cognizance, there is no need to conduct further enquiry as the informant-complainant is not raising grievance against the Judicial Enquiry; the complainant’s grievance in the said situation is only against the Order of the cognizance-taking Magistrate. And when the CJM/the concerned Magistrate would be asked to consider the Judicial Enquiry Report afresh and, pursuant thereto, if the Magistrate passes the self-same order, sending back the matter to the CJM/concerned Magistrate would turn to be an exercise in futility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt;
