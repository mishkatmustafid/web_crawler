Hence, he prays that the respondent No. 1 company is liable to be wound up and the petition be allowed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">            </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Mr. Mahbub Shafique, Mr. Mohammad Shafiqur Rahman, the learned Advocates appeared on behalf of the respondents. They submit that the Article 49 of the Articles of Association of the company, Power Backbones Ltd. provides for Arbitration and Claus No. 31 of the registered agreement deed dated 13.11.2013 also provides for Arbitration in the case of disagreement, dispute or differences between the parties. But, without referring the dispute to arbitration the petitioner cannot come before this Court, hence this petition is not maintainable. Learned Advocate next proceeds that, clause-27 of the registered Memorandum of Agreement stated that, the 1<sup>st</sup> party (petitioner) shall receive the sales proceeds from the buyers of the product. On receipt of the sales precedes, the 1<sup>st</sup> party, after keeping their portion of profit as per this agreement and after deducting loan if taken by the Power Backbones Ltd., will pay the rest amount to the Power Backbones Ltd. As such, the allegations brought against the respondents are false, <span style="color: black;">concocted, </span>therefore the instant application is not maintainable. It has also been argued that <span style="color: black;">in august 2015, the Board of Directors of the Respondent No.1 company (PBL) received news that in order to participate in a tender floated by REB, the PBL had to have at least 50% Government shares in it. Hence, in order to increase the share of BMTF in the </span>Power Backbones Ltd. (<span style="color: black;">PBL) up to 85 %, to enable it to participate in the said tender, the respondent Nos.2-5 have agreed to transfer their shares to the petitioner BMTF. It has further been argued that </span>the petitioner, BMTF authority, on 23.01.2016, taken over all Documents /File/Office equipments of Respondent’s Power Backbones Ltd. as such it is quite difficult for the respondents side to produce details document in connection with their business affairs. The learned Advocate next submits that, it will be evident from item 2 (e) of the Minutes of Directors Meeting of Power Backbones Ltd. (PBL) held on 21 October, 2015, that,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>PBL has invested 22 crore to start the production and locking system was arranged to secure BMTF’s profit. He continues that the petitioner filed another Company Matter being No. 194 of 2017 under section 43 the Companies Act, 1994 and after hearing both the parties, the Court on. 22.10.2017 was pleased to pass a Judgment<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>and order allowing the application under section 43 the Companies Act,1994 along with a direction to appoint Arbitrator, being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment, allowing the application under section 43 the Companies Act,1994, the respondents preferred Civil Miscellaneous Petition being No. 1454 of 2017 before the Hon’ble Appellate Division for stay operation of the impugned Judgment and order dated 22.10.2017 passed by the High Court Division in Company Matter No.194 of 2017 so far as it relates to the order of rectification the register of shares showing the petitioner-respondents as share holder of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>85,00,000 shares in the company since 10.08.2015 in place of respondents- petitioners by allowing the application under section 43 of Companies Act, 1994 and after hearing the same on 25.10.2017 the Hon’ble Judge-in-Chamber was pleased to pass an order as follows,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>“Stay, as prayed for, is granted for 6 (six) weeks. In the meantime, the petitioners are directed to file regular leave petition”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Hence, the ground taken on transfer of 85,00,000 shares of the respondent Nos. 2-5 is not sustainable and that minimum statutory number of directors have not fallen below the statutory requirement.

Though they have filed a supplementary affidavit on 30.10.2017 annexing photo copies of some cheques and a resolution dated 21.10.2015, however, none of these documents prove making payment of any share money or making any investment by the respondents against their 85,00,000 shares or as per clause 8,11 or 16 of the MOA.

Rather, I find that the cheques (Annexure-6 series), enclosed with the supplementary affidavit dated 30.10.2017, are evidence of transaction done between PBL and BMTF and Polli Bidut Somity. These are not evidence of payment of any money to the account of PBL as against the 85,00,000 shares given to these respondents or of any investment made by them in the PBL. On the other hand, minutes dated 05.11.2015 (Annexure- 7) is the minutes of a board meeting of PBL and in paragraph No. 2(e) of the minutes, it has been recorded that the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">PBL has invested 22 crore taka</em> to start production on the factory.

Therefore, payment of Tk. 22 crore by PBL ( even if it were true) is not the money paid by or on account of the respondent Nos. 2-5 against their shares or as paid up capital to PBL. However, there is no record in the Audit Report that the PBL has paid Tk. 22 crore to start production as noted in the said minutes, rather paragraph-4(b) of the Audit Report shows that BMTF is the sole investor in the PBL. This Audit Report has been filed by and relied upon by both sides. Thus, these respondents have deliberately tried to mislead the Court on the issue of paying share money and making investment as required of them under clause 8, 11 and 16 of the MOA. Indeed, nothing has been placed before this Court, either with the supplementary affidavit or with the affidavit in opposition, to show that the respondent Nos. 2-5 have invested a single taka as paid up capital<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>or have made any investment as agreed to in the MOA dated 13.11.2013.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">        </span></span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Besides, the contention of the respondents that, all documents of the company remained in the custody of the petitioner (BMTF) is totally false, inasmuch as the corporate office was, admittedly, situated at House No. 104 (1<sup>st</sup> Floor), Mosque Road, Old DOHS, Banani, Dhaka. Moreover, the documents, if there was any, to prove payment of share money, in cash or through banking channel, must lie with the respondents as well as with their bank and should have been reflected in the audit report. But, neither the audit report, nor any other document on record proves this contention of the respondent Nos. 2-5. The respondent Nos.2-5, being in the Board, were the custodian of all documents as per law and they are responsible to safely keep, maintain and produce them.

These respondent Nos. 2-4, who are shown to be a director in article 24 of the AOA, in fact, does not hold any paid up shares, in their name, in the company. As such, without investing any money or acquiring any paid up share in their names they have become directors of the PBL, quite against the purport and intent of the provisions of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 92 and section 97 of the Act, that require that the directors should have paid up share in their own name to be qualified for holding the position of and to continue as the director of a company.<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> The underlying reason in requiring paid up shares in the name of directors is that, a company cannot be left in the hands of the persons who do not have any paid up share or investment, in kind or in cash, in the company and such persons cannot be expected to act in the interest of the company.
