Under the Nitimala, 2009, the authority concerned called more or less 41 Senior Principal Officers including the petitioners for an interview on 11.06.2011 for promotion to the post of Assistant General Manager (AGM).

As per amended provision of section 4 of the said Act, 1980 the Administrative Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine applications made by any person in the service of the Republic or of any statutory public authority in respect of the terms and conditions of his service. Indisputably, promotion falls within the terms and conditions of service as such the grievance of the petitioners absolutely falls within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Tribunal. Since the impugned Nitimalas have no force of law the same can be challenged before the Administrative Tribunal but the petitioners raised the question of violation of fundamental right just to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under article 102 of the Constitution.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In the decision in the case of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Md.</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Junnur</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Rahman</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Vs.</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Bangladesh</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Shilpa</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Rin</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Sangstha</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">and</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">others</em> reported in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">17</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">BLD</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">(HCD)</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">488</em> in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">paragraph</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Nos.16,</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">17</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">and</em> <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">18</em> it was observed:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt 0.5in; text-indent: 9pt; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">“Since the learned Advocate for the petitioner contended that inspite of the decision of the Appellate Division in the case of Mujibur Rahman reported in 44 DLR writ petition for enforcement of fundamental right is maintainable and he addressed us on this question at great length the same requires to be considered. There is no doubt that right to move this Court for enforcement of fundamental right under Article 102(1) of the Constitution is itself a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 44 of the Constitution. But the question is whether an employee or officer of B.S.R.S. can move this Court for enforcement of any fundamental right in respect of matters falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Administrative Tribunal. Administrative Tribunal has jurisdiction in respect of service matters of the employees and officers of B.S.R.S. in view of the amendment of the Administrative Tribunal Act by the Administrative Tribunal (Amendment) Ordinance, 1984. Section 4 of the Administrative Tribunal Act after such amendment provides that the Administrative Tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine applications made by any person in the service of the Republic or of any statutory public authority (which includes B.S.R.S.) in respect of the terms and conditions of his service including pension rights or in respect of any action taken in relation to him as a person in the service of the Republic or of any statutory public authority. Promotion being part of the terms and conditions of the service of any such person a grievance in respect of the same undoubtedly falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Administrative Tribunal. To overcome the difficulty petitioner alleged violation of fundamental right of equality before the law and equal opportunity in respect of his employment under Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution by the impugned Administrative Circular making guideline for promotion and by the impugned order promoting the respondent Nos.4-8 excluding him. We have already seen that the aforesaid guideline has been made by the Board of Directors in exercise of its power under Article 7(1) of the B.S.R.S. Order for administration of the affairs of the Sangstha subject to the rules made under the order. Regulation 11(4) of the B.S.R.S. Employees Service Regulations 1988 though provided that promotion to the post in the scale of pay of Tk.3700-4825/-and above shall be on merit-cum-seniority basis there is nothing in the said Regulations for assessing the merit of the candidates for promotion. So, in exercise of power under Article 7(1) of the Order Board of Director of B.S.R.S. by the aforesaid impugned Administrative Circular made guideline for the promotion committee to assess merit of the candidates for promotion. In view of the same we find that the impugned Administration Circular is not any rule or by-law or regulation which requires publication in the official gazette. Moreover, the impugned Administrative Circular not being rule or regulation but merely an Administrative Circular for internal guidance of the promotion committee to assess the merit of the candidates for promotion the same is an ordinary document validity of which can be challenged before the Administrative Tribunal. Had the same been any rule or regulation of B.S.R.S. then Administrative Tribunal could not declare the same as void for violation of any fundamental right as could be done by this Court in an application under Article 102(1) of the Constitution. Only in such circumstances writ petition by the petitioner could be maintainable. The impugned guideline not being any service regulation and violated any fundamental right of the petitioner there is no question of enforcement of any fundamental right of the petitioner by filing a writ petition by avoiding the Administrative Tribunal which is competent to decide the grievance of the petitioner.(Para-16)</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt 0.5in; text-indent: 9pt; text-align: justify;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">We have already found that petitioners merit was assessed by the promotion committee and all other candidates fared better than him in the A.C.R as well as in the interview. There is no allegation of malafide or bias against any member of the promotion committee. As he failed to obtain qualifying marks in the interview he has challenged the provision for interview earmarking 25 marks out of 100 marks in the interview and keeping 18 marks as the qualifying marks therein. Though he was promoted from the post of P.O. to the post of S.P.O facing interview in 1988 he raised the question of violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 27 and 29 of the Constitution only to come to this Court with a writ petition. On consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case we found no violation of fundamental right as alleged. It appears to us that out of desperation as observed by the Appellate Division in Mujibur Rahman’s case petitioner has alleged violation of fundamental rights to come before this Court for speedy relief avoiding lengthy adjudication by the Administrative Tribunal.(Para-17)</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.5in; text-indent: 9pt; line-height: 110%; text-align: justify;"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Learned Advocate for the petitioner could not show any authority in support of his contention that the administrative circular is also law and is liable to be struck down if found violative of any fundamental right. In the case of Administrative Tribunal Vs. Muklesur Rahman reported in 36 DLR-71 it has been held that circulars issued by the Government are for the guidance of the executives and the same have no legal force. Since there is no question of violation of any fundamental right in formulating the guideline by the B.S.R.S. providing for interview etc. and the impugned Administrative Circular is not law within the meaning of Article 152 of the Constitution we are of the view that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable.
