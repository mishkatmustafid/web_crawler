When a party who has caused the reference to be made and who is in the position of a plaintiff fails to appear, consequently no hearing can take place, in such a case obligation of deciding the question of law and delivering judgment does not arise. The High Court Division shall upon hearing any case" which directs that there shall be a hearing of the application.

Prior to his inquiry PW-32 conducted an inquiry and on 11.06.2008 PW-32 submitted a report. He was appointed as the inquiry officer after submission of the said report and he submitted his report on 25.06.2008. He had no knowledge whether report submitted by PW-32 was accepted or rejected. During inquiry he recorded the statements of PW-19 and PW-21. At the time of lodging the first information report on 03.07.2006 Begum Zia was in jail hazat in connection with another case. Previous inquiry officer, PW-32 recorded the statement of Begum Zia during his inquiry. The previous inquiry officer also recorded the statement of Tareque Rahman and Arafat Rahman. During investigation he recorded the statements of Begum Zia and Tareque Rahman but he did not submit the same before the court. He submitted the charge sheet on 05.08.2009 i.e. after the Government led by Bangladesh Awami League came into power. He did not record any statement of the Ambassador of Kuwait in Bangladesh or the Ambassador of Bangladesh in Kuwait at the relevant time. US $12,55,000 came from United Saudi Commercial Bank in Riyadh vide DD no.153369970 dated 09.06.2011. He did not seize the said DD from Sonali Bank Limited, Ramna Branch but he verified the same. In order to know the identity of the ‘drawer’ of the said DD Bangladesh Embassy in Riyadh was contacted by the Commission through Ministry of Foreign Affairs but they could not ascertain the identity of the ‘drawer’. In the said DD the name of the payee was mentioned as Prime Minister’s Orphanage Fund, Current A/C no.5416, Sonali Bank, Ramna Branch, Dhaka and the amount was mentioned as One Million Two Hundred Fifty-Five Thousands. In the account opening form of A/C no.5416 Begum Zia had no signature but as per her instructions the concerned officer Kamal Siddique signed on the same. The said account was opened on 02.06.1991 and at the relevant time there was no rule (Nitimala) to operate the said orphanage fund. The Prime Minister’s office runs as per the organogram. At the relevant time additional secretary Kamal Siddique was in-charge of the secretary of Prime Minister’s office and he has been implicated in the case as <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">prima facie</em> materials have been found against him in commission of the offence. He could not seize any file or cheque having signature of Begum Zia with regard to the disbursement from the PM’s Orphanage Fund. When the money was brought through DD at that time the Trust was not established. He had no knowledge whether the then Foreign Minister Mustafizur Rahman collected and brought the said money and he established Zia Memorial Trust at Bagerhat spending Tk.2,33,33,500/- from the said fund. He also conducted inquiry about the fund of the said Trust. During his inquiry he did not interrogate the cabinet secretary, secretary, additional secretary, joint secretary, director general of the Prime Minister’s Office but he interrogated the additional secretary Kamal Siddique as he was working as the secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office and found his involvement in commission of the offence. According to the Trust deed Begum Zia was not the settlor or the trustee or the member of Trustee board. He examined the orphanage fund and relief fund’s record of the Prime Minister’s Office. He did not ask any officer of the Sonali Bank, Ramna Corporate Branch regarding the source or sender of the DD US $12,55,000 which was deposited in the said bank. In his inquiry report he did not mention about the letter which was sent to the Bangladesh Ambassador in Saudi Arab through Foreign Ministry for knowing the source of the DD. Tareque Rahman and Mominur Rahman informed him during their respective interrogation that the said US dollar was sent by the Amir of Kuwait for raising fund for the Trust in the name of former President late Ziaur Rahman. He did not make any contact with the Kuwait Embassy in Bangladesh for verifying the statement of Tareque Rahman. He did not contact with the Bangladesh Embassy in Saudi Arab for knowing the source of the said DD because he had no opportunity to contact with them. Mominur Rahman also informed him that half of the said amount was allotted for the Trust and the half of the said amount was allotted for Bagherhat Zia Memorial Orphanage Trust for establishing an orphanage in Bagherhat. During interrogation Begum Zia informed him that she could not able to remember about the foreign donation which allotted for the Zia Orphanage Trust and Zia Memorial Orphanage Trust and the then Foreign Minister Mustafizur Rahman knew regarding formation of the Trust and foreign donation. PW-1 denied the defence suggestions that Begum Zia did not open the orphanage fund account no.5416 with the Sonali Bank. Ramna Corporate Branch and his statement regarding the DD for the amount of US $12,55,000 sent from the United Saudi Commercial Bank was false, and that Begum Zia did not formulate any regulation regarding the uses of orphanage fund or without following the rules and regulation formed the Trust with a dishonest intention in order to misappropriate the fund, and that money was not used for the welfare and benefit of the orphans, and that Begum Zia was not involved with the fund allotment, account opening and withdrawal of money from the PM’s Orphanage Fund and that amount of the Trust fund was never misappropriated and the said amount was kept in the bank, and that the Trust fund was formed legally and properly with the donation of the Amir of Kuwait, and that the alleged US dollar was came from Riyadh, Suadi Arab was false. PW-1 did not make any inquiry in Bangladesh Bank regarding transfer of the said US $12,55,000 to the Sonali Bank, Ramna Corporate Branch. Tareque Rahman was interrogated by previous inquiry officer at the jail gate with the permission of the court. During inquiry he did not interrogate Tareque Rahman and perused the records of previous inquiry officer. The Trust was a private Trust and according to Article-14 of the Trust deed, a Board of Trustee was formed and Tareque Rahman, Arafat Rahman and Mominur Rahman were the member of Trustee Board and according to Arcitle-3(III) of deed of Trust, FDR was included with the investment fund. The Trust deed provided the power for opening FDR in the name of the Trust. During investigation, he saw the deed of Trust, Balam books, thumb impressions and various documents relating to the Trust. At the time of formation of the Trust and registration of the Trust deed Begum Zia and her two sons Tareque Rahman and Arafat Rahman were living together at 6, Shaheed Moinul Road, Dhaka Cantonment, Dhaka and at the relevant time that house was being used as the official residence of Prime Minister Begum Zia. PW-1 denied the defence suggestions that the Trust office was not at 6, Shaheed Moinul Road though he knew the said information, and no illegality was done in transfering the money from the Sonali Bank to the Prime Bank by the trustees, and that no bank officer did raised any question as to the said transfer, and that the Trustee board member Tarek Rahman, Mominur Rahman transferred in total Tk. 3,30,00,000/- on 12.04.2006, 15,06.2006 and 04.07.2006 to the Prime Bank, Gulshan Branch for opening FDR with bonafide intention, and that according to Trust deed, the amount of the Trust was transferred legally from one bank to another bank, and that opening of FDRs in the name of Salimul Haque, Sayed Ahmed @ Sayed Ahmed, Giasuddin Ahmed and Sharfuddin and encashment of the FDRs were legal, and that according to the Trust law and trust deed their activities were legal, and that in order to get maximum benefit the said Trust funds had transferred to the different accounts, and that no misappropriation of money was occurred, and that the activities of the Trust were done by following the decisions of Trust deed, and that after the death of former President Ziaur Rahman the Amir of Kuwait sent funds for the Trust, and that the Trust being a private Trust the Government has no power to control the Trust, and that the case was filed against the accused persons with malafide motive.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l13 level1 lfo16; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">PW-2 S.M.

In the first inquiry report it was mentioned that the Trust was registered as a private Trust so the members of said Trust would not be treated as public servant, and that the Prime Minister’s Office could not avail to provide the documents of record no.02.39.19.1.13.94.93 and thus, he (PW-32) could not ascertain whether the rules and regulations were followed for allotment of the funds, and that in 1993 the amount of Tk.2,33,33,500/- was donated for the said Trust from the PM’s Orphanage Fund, and that the Amir of Kuwait sent the said amount in the name of former President late Ziaur Rahman for establishment of the said welfare Trust. PW-32 in his inquiry report did not recommend for prosecution of Begum Zia. The amount of Tk.2,33,33,500/- was given to Zia Memorial Trust in Bagerhat which was established by Mustafizur Rahman and on the same day Tk.2,33,33,500/- was given to the Trust.

He interrogated Mustafizur Rahman’s wife and son but did not record their statements. He interrogated Begum Zia and Tareque Rahman during his investigation and recorded their statements but he did not submit the same before the court. On 16.06.2008 he sent a letter to the secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs for knowing the source of the alleged fund and they came to know that United Saudi Commercial Bank was not in operation. He did not mention in the letter, exhibit-21 that he required information wheather the Amir of Kuwait donated the said fund. He sent a letter to the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affiars, East Asia, as an emergency basis for knowing the information, exhibit-23. Sonali Bank Ltd. had its own foreign exchange department and gave information to the Bangladesh Bank regarding the remittance or foreign exchange. There was no statement from Mustafizur Rahman’s family regarding the source of the said funds and he did not interrogate them. On 14.08.2008 he interrogated Touhidur Rahman Khan, director of Chief Advisor’s Office, but the original record of the PM’s Orphanage fund could not trace out though he found cash register, counter foil of cheques etc. On 21.07.2008 he sent a letter, exhibit-42 to the manager of the Sonali Bank Ltd., Ramna Corporate branch, but he did not give any reply and on 22.07.2008 he went to the said bank and seized some documents. He denied the defence suggestion that the documents or Photostat copies of PM’s Orphanage Fund which he collected were created and fabricated. He received sanction for submitting the charge sheet on 10.09.2008. In the seized record, material exhibit-III series, there was overwriting and nobody could not able to give him the information who did the said overwriting. The informations and documents regarding US $12,55,000 for the PM’s Orphanage Fund and the current account no.5416 of Sonali Bank, Ramna Corporate Branch were available to the material exhibit-III and exhibit-III(A) series records. Informations regarding the Prime Minister’s relief and welfare fund were also available to material exhibit-XIII(A) series and according to the said record applications were presented properly in every year and the record shows that the Prime Minister approved those applications. Prime Minister’s relief funds, welfare funds and optional funds were not the issue of this case.

In the plaint address of Enamul Haque was mentioned as 6, Moinul Road and his present and permanent address were not mentioned. In the plaint it was not written that the Board of Trustee authorized Enamul Haque to file the suit. He refused to say anything with regard to the PM’s Orphanage Fund and money transferred from the said fund to Trust fund on 13.11.1993. He had no knowledge about the purchase of land at Bogra in the name of the Trust and encashment of two FDRs in the name of Giasuddin and thereafter the money was transferred to Sharfuddin’s account by 6 payment orders. In the plaint it was not mentioned from whom Enamul Haque received the money to pay the same to Sharfuddin. In the ‘memorandum of agreement’ no trustee was signed as a witness and none of the trustee authenticated the said agreement. Advocate Sanaullah Mia signed on the agreement as a witness but he did not use his professional designation.

First; who was the money given to, the PM’s Orphanage Fund or the individual who was the Prime Minister at the relevant time? If the answer is that the money was given to the individual, then it leads to a second question:- why was the individual paid into an account titled the “PM’s Orphanage Fund”? A question would then arise as to why the individual was soliciting funds for their personal use by using the office they were holding. However, if the answer to the first question is that the money was given to the PM’s Orphanage Fund; then the second question would be who empowered the individual with the authority to use the money from the PM’s Orphanage Fund for their personal use? It is considered that any money paid into a public office is deemed to be held in trust by the office for the use of the public. This would mean that the fund available under the PM’s Orphanage Fund is to be used by the Prime Minister’s Office for public use, which in this particular case would be for well being of the orphans. However, under no circumstances the money paid into the PM’s Orphanage Fund could ever be used for anyone’s personal use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l13 level1 lfo16; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">139.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">     </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">It is pertinent to be mentioned here that Kamal Siddique was a high ranking government official at the relevant time and under no stretch of imagination it can be presumed that Kamal Siddique opened the account in the name of PM’s Orphanage Fund and eventually dealt with the fund without any approval and instruction from the Prime Minister Begum Zia. No prudent man can believe such an absurd proposition that Kamal Siddique himself opened the above bank account in his personal initiative and capacity.

Some portion of the fund was transferred to a socalled paper trust namely Zia Orphanage Trust in the year 1993. After 13 years the money along with interest was later moved from the Trust account unlawfully, in 2006 without doing any charity in particular for the orphans. The money was later moved in 2006 to the FDR account of Salimul Haque and two others, who then transferred the money again to Sharfuddin’s account. Considering all of these separate transactions relates to the same money, arising out of the same origin point PM’s orphanage fund, it can well be argued and indeed considered for these transactions to be rooted in the same origin.

He submitted that the Court of Settlement arrived at the aforesaid finding that the petitioner/respondent is not the heir of Md. Nazir, merely on suspicion, caused by some of her oral testimony which she made, because of her illness and fright, in utter disregard to the documentary evidence, viz. Annexure-B and D, i.e. Affidavit dated 09.04.1964 sworn before the Magistrate, First Class as well as Succession Certificate obtained from Third Court of the then Subordinate Judge, Dhaka.

He submitted that the Court of Settlement was satisfied that the deposition of the petitioner/respondent was not correctly recorded and as such passed the order dated 03.05.1994 allowing re-examination of the petitioner, but ultimately passed the impugned decision on the basis of the said incorrect initial deposition.

In other words, a witness may be recalled to supplement his or her evidence, but not to correct what he or she stated earlier. The fact that the petitioner, while deposing before the Court of Settlement contradicted her own statement made in her petition, could not be corrected on her re-examination.

That is one of the basic conditions for applicability of section 4 of the Partition Act which has been expressly mentioned in the section is that the stranger transferee must sue for partition and separate possession of the undivided share transferred to him by the co-sharer. If the stranger moves execution application for separating his share by metes and bounds it would be treated to be application for suing for partition and it is not necessary that separate suit should be filed by such stranger transferee. “Such transferee sues for partition” includes idea of some action by transferee to secure partition even praying saham in suit for partition paying necessary court fees which is totally absent in this case. In this case the defendant No.5 appellant Shamsul Alam is the transferee of the land under partition and the suit has been filed by Dr. Ashim Sarker who is not the transferee and appellant did not pray for any saham as yet in the said suit for partition, so the prayer for buying up by the plaintiff was not at all maintainable at the stage of the suit when the same was prayed for.

Ishan Chandra Dey died leaving his full brother Pran Krishna as his heir. Pran Krishna Dey died leaving two sons Umesh Chandra Sarker and Surendra Lal Sarker and another son Jugesh Chandra Sarker, predeceased Pran Krishna, leaving his widow Niroda Bala. Niroda sold her share to plaintiff’s father, the defendant No.3 by kabala deed dated 16.04.1959. Surendra Lal Sarker died leaving only son Babul Chandra Sarker, the defendant No.1. Babul Chandra Sarker transferred his share to Anima Sarker by a kabala deed dated 04.05.1978. Sunil Kanti (defendant No.3), father of the plaintiff, instituted Miscellaneous Case No.16 of 1986 in the Court of Assistant Judge, Hathazari against Anima Sarker to get the said land by way of pre-emption which was allowed. Anima Sarker preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No.37 of 1988 which ended on compromise and Sunil Kanti got the said land. Sunil Kanti and Umesh Chandra Sarker gifted their share to Charu Bala by deed of gift dated 11.03.1970. Charu Bala gifted the said land to Sunil Kanti Sarker, the defendant No.3, father of the plaintiff and Dilip Chandra Sarker, the defendant No.4 uncle of the plaintiff. Umesh Chandra Sarker executed a will on 26.03.1970 in favour of Sunil Kanti Sarker, Dilip Chandra Sarker and Amalendu Sarker who filed Probate Case No.70 of 1988 which was subsequently registered as civil suit No.04 of 1990. The said suit ended on compromise and Sunil Kanti Sarker, Dilip Chandra Sarker obtained order of probate. Sunil Kanti Sarker and Dilip Chandra Sarker purchased the share of Amalendu Sarker by kabala deed dated 28.12.1969. All the co-sharers effected an amicable partition of those land on 28.10.1995. Thereafter, the defendant No.3 Sunil Kanti Sarker, father of the plaintiff and defendant No.4 Dilip Chandra Sarker, uncle of the plaintiff, sold .66 acre of land to this defendant No.5 by kabala deed No.787 dated 20.07.1996. They also sold .23 acre of land to this defendant by another kabala deed No.804 dated 27.07.1996 and delivered possession. They also transferred some other lands by a deed of exchange.

Dwelling house belonging to an undivided family means family not decided qua dwelling house. The essence is that the house itself should be undivided although the cosharers having defined shares. As long as there is a dwelling house which has not been divided qua the family it might be said to be a dwelling house belonging to an undivided family for the purpose of section 4(1) of the Act.

Section 44 is to maintain the integrity of the family dwelling-house which provides that the transferee of a dwelling house, if he/she is not a member of that family, gets no right to joint possession or common enjoyment of the house. The said provision adequately protects the family members against intrusion by an outsider into the dwelling house. The purchaser, though stranger, has certainly his title to the undivided share of the joint property by reason of his purchase but in enforcing his rights he is fettered to this extent that he cannot claim any joint possession in the undivided family dwelling house. That does not mean that the purchaser is without remedy. The purchaser has his remedy and he can sue for partition by metes and bounds and after such partition possess his own share, unless he is pre-empted under section 4 of the Partition Act. The only manner in which an outsider can get possession is to sue for possession and claim separation of his share. In that case section 4 of the Partition Act comes into play. In the case of Dorab Cowasji Warder V. Loomi Sorab Warder reported in (1990) 2 SCC 117 it was observed that even if the family is divided in status in the sense that they were holding the property as tenants in common but undivided qua the property, that is, the property had not been divided by metes and bounds, it would be within the provisions of section 44 of the Transfer of Property Act.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: 'Times-Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: Times-Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times-Roman;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">20.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">               </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In such view of the discussion made above, it is observed that to get an order of preemption under section 4 of the Partition Act three condition are to be fulfilled, i.e. (1) the property must be dwelling house,<span style="color: #000000;"> (2) it must be t</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">he undivided family and then (3) the purchasers must file the partition suit. That is one of the basic conditions for applicability of section 4 of the Partition Act which has been expressly mentioned in the section is that the stranger transferee must sue for partition and separate possession of the undivided share transferred to him by the co-sharer. If the stranger moves execution application for separating his share by metes and bounds it would be treated to be application for suing for partition and it is not necessary that separate suit should be filed by such stranger transferee. “Such transferee sues for partition” includes idea of some action by transferee to secure partition even praying saham in suit for partition paying necessary court fees which is totally absent in this case. In this case the defendant No.5 appellant Shamsul Alam is the transferee of the land under partition and the suit has been filed by Dr. Ashim Sarker who is not the transferee and appellant did not pray for any saham as yet in the said suit for partition, so the prayer for buying up by the plaintiff was not at all maintainable at the stage of the suit when the same was prayed for.

The learned Advocate further submits that no new fact was inserted in the application for amendment by which the nature and character of the suit can be changed, rather; under the ambit of Order VI, rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure for effective and proper adjudication of the original suit for partition to arrive at a concrete decision as to the matter of controversy between the parties the proposed amendment of the written statement was prayed for and the learned trial court rightly allowed the same for determining the real question in controversy between the parties to avoid multiplicity of the proceedings by his order dated 10.06.2012. The learned Advocate after referring some decisions of this court and our Apex court reported in 21 BLT(AD) 175, 3 ALR(AD)5, 41 DLR 389, 42 DLR 227 and 246, 48 DLR 372 and 45 DLR 154 argued that the amendment of pleadings can be allowed at any stage of the proceedings and for determining the real question in controversy between the parties if it is found in any stage of the proceedings that the amendment is necessary, the court is quite empowered to allow such application for amendment and in this case delay is immaterial to arrive at a decision as to the amendment of the pleadings.

The learned Advocate further submits that the proposed amendment is vexatious and only to drag time in disposal of the original suit it was sought for from the side of the defendants to the original partition suit. The leaned Advocate also submits that the application for amendment filed under Order VI, rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure was not brought properly and the amendment was not necessary for determining the real question in controversy between the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The learned Advocate argued that the proposed amendment will change the nature and character of the suit, inasmuch as; in the earlier written statement the defendants claimed their right, title, interest on the basis of separate facts and therefrom by the proposed amendment they were willing to bring a third case which is new and not necessary to arrive at a correct decision as to the matter of adjudication among the parties. The learned Advocate also submits that the ‘<em>Nadabinama’</em> as alleged from the side of the defendants does not create any title or extinguish any right, title, interest of anybody and it would mere wastage of time and earlier for five times the defendants amended their written statement and as a result of that, the learned District Judge, Rajshahi rightly after considering the facts and circumstances of the case allowed the civil revision and set aside the order of the learned trial court by which the learned Senior Assistant Judge, Puthia, Rajshahi allowed the application for amendment of written statement.

I also find from the application for amendment of the written statement filed under Order VI, rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure that the defendants to the original suit in their proposed amendment clarified the matter of amicable settlement among the co-sharers of the suit holding and a case of ‘<em>nadabinama’</em> deed was brought by the defendants in the application which was allegedly executed in favour of one Mithon Sha, the predecessor-in interest of the defendants.

Therefore, the plaintiff cannot challenged the right and title of the defendant praying for cancellation of deed under section 39 of the Specific Relief Act and side by side cannot seek redress in a such title suit for recovery of Khash possession under section 9 of the Specific Relief Act. However, the learned Judge of the Court below has patently misunderstood the provision of law as enacted in section 39 of the Specific Relief Act as well as section 9 of the same Act. Therefore, misconstrued himself the provision of law as well as the contents of the application under order 7 Rule 11 of the Code filed by the defendant petitioner and, as such, the impugned judgment and order is liable to be set aside. Mr. Ahmed further submitted that, even if, all the facts and circumstances and the averments of the plaint are accepted as true those do not prove that the plaintiff has any right and interest over the suit property. Therefore, how the Court of justice specifically can grant any relief to the plaintiff as sought in the instant suit.

Mr. Ahmed has produced both the judgment i.e. judgment of Civil Revision No. 2353 of 2007 and Leave to Appeal No. 2484 of 2009 and took us through the aforementioned judgments of both the Division. He has pointed that the vendor of the defendant No. 1 of the instant suit was the party in the earlier suit as the defendant No.1and litigating with same land. The plaintiff of the earlier suit had claimed the suit property by dint of same unregistered sale deed of agreement. However, the Apex Court has affirmed the judgment of the High Court Division wherein it has been held that by dint of unregistered sale agreement the plaintiff does not acquire any right, title and interest over the suit property. While earlier litigation has been continuing the same plaintiff instituted the instant Title Suit being No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>455 of 2009 and that was brought to the notices to the High Court Division at the time of hearing of Civil Revision No. 2353 of 2007.

The plaintiff has failed to establish any right and title over the suit property in earlier suit up to Hon’ble Appellate Division. Since the plaintiff has no right, title and interest over the suit property as found earlier by the apex Court, so, the present suit cannot continue seeking redress to recovery of khash possession as well as cancellation of the deed and, as such, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">We have gone through the impugned order dated 08.8.2012 along with plaint of Title Suit No. 255 of 2009 and the application for rejection of plaint.

However, on perusal of the averment regarding the right, title and possession over the suit property of the plaintiff was not found by dint of any legal instrument in accordance with law or by dint of alleged unregister deed of sale agreement. The plaintiff has claimed the possession of the suit property without any reference in the averment of the plaint through unregistered sale deed of agreement or without mentioning any date for handing over the possession by the counter part of agreement. In this connection we may referred the earlier litigation between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 2 who is none but vendor of the defendant No. 1 and in the earlier litigation a Division Bench of this Court has already decided the fate of the same unregistered sale deed for agreement. To settle the facts of the such unregistered sale of agreement once for all we would like to say that after amendment of Registration Act 2005 which has been effected from 1<sup>st</sup> July 2005 as well as Specific Relief Act on the same year and effected on the same day it cannot be said that an unregistered deed of sale for agreement is enforceable unless from 1<sup>st</sup> July 2005 the bearer of unregistered sale agreement file a suit for registration of the instrument within six months. It is obvious that after expiry of the six months by dint of operation of the law such deed for sale agreement is nothing nor legal instrument which is not binding upon the executants. In the present Case in hand from the averments as narrated in the plaint we do not find anywhere of the plaint that the plaintiff has claimed the right and title of the suit property by dint of any legal instrument rather his claim for cancelation of the deed of the defendant by dint of an unregistered void deed of sale agreement against which dictum of apex Court has already given in earlier occasion. Moreover, the plaintiff of the instant suit is not the party of the said instrument as prayed for cancellation. It is settled by the apex Court regarding the cancellation of the deed who is not the party in the instrument he has no status to seek the cancellation of the instrument rather, if by such instrument he apprehend any injury in that case he can filed a suit for declaration to the effect that such instrument is not binding upon him. In this regard we may place reliance to the case of Sultana Begum and another Vs. Abul Kalam reported 43 D.L.R (HCD) 177 and to the case of Momtaz Begum and others Vs. Md. Masud Khan reported 52 D.L.R (AD) 46.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">24.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">In the present case however, we find from the prayer and cause title of Title Suit No. 255 the plaintiff did not seek any such relief.

We are, therefore, of the considered view that allegation made by the plaintiff in the prayer ‘Ka’ of the plaint is nothing but a superfluous and colorable prayer against the defendant No. 1 only to continue the litigation on the second phase unsuccessfully in the earlier litigation up to the apex Court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">25.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In view of the provision of the section 9 we must consider whether plaintiff can file a suit invoking the provision of section 9 of the Specific Relief Act to recover Khash possession of the suit property. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">26.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">         </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">On a bare reading and careful scrutiny of the averments of the plaint we find in paragraph 26 the plaintiff has narrated that he has been dispossessed from the suit property on 21.3.2009 by the defendant No. 1 and 2 but on perusal of the averments of the plaint we do not find any averments on what date the plaintiff was put in on possession by the vendor by dint of sale agreement, in other words, how the plaintiff got the possession of the property.
