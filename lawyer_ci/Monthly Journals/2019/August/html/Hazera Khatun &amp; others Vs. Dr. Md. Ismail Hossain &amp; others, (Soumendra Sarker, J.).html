The learned Advocate further submits that after pronouncement of the impugned judgment and decree dated 05.03.2012, the learned Advocate who was engaged on behalf of the petitioners in the Appellate Court wrongly informed the Defendant No. 20(Ka)- 20(Jha) that their application for saham has been allowed by the Appellate Court and for the said reason the Defendant-Petitioners did not feel any necessity to proceed against the judgment and decree of the Appellate Court dated 05.03.2012. The learned Advocate also submits that in the month of October, 2017 the present petitioners came to know that some of the defendants of the Partition Suit No. 229 of 1991 preferred Civil Revision No. 1207 of 2012 and 1208 of 2012 and Rule has been issued in both the civil revisions and the operation of the impugned judgment and decree dated 05.03.2017 has been stayed. The petitioners in those civil revisions not impleaded the present petitioners in their revisional applications. Thereafter the petitioners knowing about those civil revisions filed an application for addition of party in Civil Revision No. 1207 of 2012 and pursuant to that, they have been added as opposite parties No. 85-91 in that Civil Revision No. 1207 of 2012. At this stage, the learned Advocate for the petitioners going through the judgment of the Appellate Court on 28.12.2017 disclosed before the petitioners that the petitioners have been allowed a separate saham for .01625 acres of land, although the petitioners prayed for getting a separate saham to the extent of .0462 acres of land. Knowing about that, the petitioners felt aggrieved and decided to prefer a civil revision against the judgment and decree of the Appellate Court and accordingly, requested their engaged Advocate to file civil revision against the judgment and decree dated 05.03.2012. The learned Advocate lastly submits that, receiving the papers for filing of the civil revision, after drafting the revisional<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>application he has filed the revisional application, but meanwhile a delay of 2037 days occurred, which is unintentional<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>and not for the negligence of the petitioner-applicants. The learned Advocate also submits that the petitioners were wrongly informed initially by their engaged Lawyer of the appellate court that they have obtained their prayed saham and due to that wrong<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>information of the then Advocate of the petitioners, the petitioners could not bring the revisional application within time and thereby the cause of delay is <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> and purely for the wrong information and misrepresentation of the learned Advocate for the petitioners, who was engaged in conducting<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the appeal before the appellate court and as such the learned Advocate prays for condonation of the delay. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">In order to appreciate the submission advanced from the side of the learned Counsel for the petitioners, having gone through the judgment and decree passed by the trial court dated 30.11.1997 in the original Partition Suit No. 229 of 1991 along with the impugned judgment and decree passed by the Appellate Court on 05.03.2012 in other Appeal No. 44 of 1998 and the relevant papers, it transpires that, it was the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>specific case of the present petitioner-applicants in their application for getting a separate saham that they are entitled a separate saham for a land measuring .0462 acres and in this context, obviously it is noticed from the impugned judgment and decree that the petitioner-applicants were allowed a separate saham for .01625 acres of land in the suit holding and these applicants were the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>defendants No. 20(Ka)-20 (Jha) to the original suit. It is also the specific contention of the Petitioner-Applicants that inasmuch as, their the then engaged Lawyer wrongly informed them that the appellate court by its judgment and decree dated 05.03.2012 allowed a separate saham in favour of the present Defendant-Respondent-Petitioners according to their prayer and for that reason, the Defendants No. 20(Kha)-20(Jha) that their application for saham have been allowed by the Appellate Court, the Defendant-Respondent-Petitioners did not feel any necessity to proceed against the judgment and decree dated 05.03.2012. It was further contended from the side of the applicants in their application for condonation of delay that for the 1<sup>st</sup> time on 28.12.2017 they came to know from their engaged Lawyer that they have been allowed a less quantum of land than that of their prayed quantum of land and instead of .0462 acres of land, they were given .01625 acres of land and at that time the petitioners felt aggrieved and being dissatisfied with the judgment and decree passed by the Appellate Court, they have decided to prefer Civil Revision. It is the specific case of the petitioner-applicants that for the wrong information and misrepresentation of their earlier engaged Advocate of the Appellate Court, the petitioners could not prefer the civil revision within time and the petitioners as such were prevented by sufficient cause in not bringing the civil revision within the statutory<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>period of limitation. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Section 05 of the law of limitation (Act IX of 1908) contemplates that, delay due to wrong but <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bona fide</em> advice of the Lawyer can be treated sufficient explanation of delay.
