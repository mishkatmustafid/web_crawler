Subsequently, Broja Bashi died leaving behind two sons namely Jotish Jaladash and Piary Mohon Jaladash. Gokul Bashi died leaving behind one son Piary Mohon Jaladash. The P.S. record of right was correctly prepared in the names of Jotish, Piary Mohon and Hori Mohon Jaladash. Jotish Jaladash died leaving behind one son the defendant No.1. The suit land has been recorded in the recent khatian in the names of Jotish, Hori Mohon, Piary Mohon and one Nirmol Jaladash and it is the case of the plaintiff that the record in the name of Nirmal Jaladash was wrong. Jotish Jaladash sold out his share in favour of the plaintiff and his brother the defendant No.7 by a registered sub-kabala dated 27.09.1978 and the plaintiff has been possessing the suit land from the time of his father. The municipal holding was in the name of the plaintiff’s father and after the death of their father the plaintiff mutated his name, but the share of the plaintiff was written as 02 annas in place of 04 annas in the mutation khatian. The B.S. recorded tenant Nirmol Jaladash has no right, title, interest and possession in the suit holding. The actual share of the plaintiff’s vendor was not recorded in the relevant B.S. khatian and the further case of the plaintiff is such that his house was burnt in the year 1997. Due to the obstruction of the defendant No.1, the plaintiff failed to re-construct his house in the suit land, which constrained the plaintiff to institute the original suit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The contrary case of the contesting defendant No.1 in short is thus, that Gokul Bashi and Broja Bashi were the original owners of the suit land. Gokul Bash died leaving behind one son Horimon Jaladash. Subsequently, Horimon died leaving behind one daughter. Broja Bashi died leaving behind two sons namely Piary Mohon and Jotish. At the death of Jotish his only son the defendant No.1 inherited the property and had been owning and residing in the suit premises with his family members. It is the case of the defendant-opposite party that Jotish Jaladash never sold out the suit land in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant No.7 and the kabala deed dated 27.09.1978 in fact was not executed and registered by Jotish Jaladash and the said kabala deed is a forged, created and spurious document. The further case of the defendant-opposite party is such that Jotish Jaladash was a literate person and he was able to put his signature and used to perform his regular works by putting his signature. Due to his illness from the year 1971 till his death he could not move and the plaintiff out of ill-motive to grab the property on the basis of a forged kabala deed having no manner of right, title, interest and possession in the suit premises on false allegation filed the suit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">The learned trial court during trial of the original suit after framing 04 different issues examined witnesses from the sides of the respective parties and thereafter dismissed the suit on contest by his judgment and decree dated 29.06.2000.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Being aggrieved, the plaintiff preferred an Other Appeal being No.320 of 2000 in the Court of learned District Judge, Chittagong, which was transmitted to the 7<sup>th</sup> Court of learned Additional District Judge, Chittagong for hearing and disposal and the learned appellate court on hearing the appeal by the impugned judgment and decree dated 29.11.2007 disallowed the appeal and affirmed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">6.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and decree, the plaintiff-appellant-petitioners have preferred this revisional application under section 115(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure and obtained the Rule with an interim order of status quo.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">7.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">During hearing of the Rule Mr. M.A. Azim Khair, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the petitioners while Mr. Wadud Bhuiyan, the learned Advocate appeared on behalf of the opposite parties.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">8.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">The learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that both the courts below during disposal of the original suit and its subsequent appeal committed illegality and irregularity. The learned Advocate further submits that it is not the pleading’s case of the contesting defendant No.1 that his father Jotish Jaladash did not put his left Thumb Impression (hereinafter L.T.I.) in the sub-kabala deed dated 27.09.1978 in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant No.7 in respect of the suit property, but the learned courts below failed to appreciate the actual pleading of the plaintiff and arrived at an erroneous findings that the father of the defendant No.1 Jotish Jaladash did not execute and register the sale deed which is the title document of the plaintiff in respect of the suit property. The learned Advocate also submits that the title document of the plaintiff i.e. the sub-kabala dated 27.09.1978 has been duly proved by the plaintiff and has been marked as Exhibit-2 and as such under section 60 of the Registration Act it has got a presumptive value of correctness. The learned Advocate also submits that both the courts below committed an error of law in not taking specific notice of the defence case as made out in their written statement and as such committed an error in law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice. The learned Advocate in respect of the deposition of the defendant’s witness No.1 argued that the witness No.1 in his testimony testified that, Jotish Jaladash was paralyzed and he could not move since 1971, but the learned trial court as well as the appellate court without apprising the evidence on record came to an erroneous findings that the father of the defendant No.1 going to the concerned sub-registry office executed and registered the deed. That there is no positive evidence from the side of the contesting defendant that Exhibit-2 was created by false personification, rather; it is apparent from the face of the document that Jotish Jaladash after putting his L.T.I. executed the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant No.7. The learned Advocate lastly submits that under section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act the registered instrument marked as Exhibit-2 has a legal value of transfer and until and unless this document is cancelled by a competent court of law, it cannot be said that no property was transferred by this instrument in favour of the purchasers and realizing the legal position after filing of the suit in the year 1997 the defendant filed an Other Suit being No.23 of 1999 for cancellation of the kabala deed, but that suit was dismissed for non-prosecution on 03.06.2008 vide Annexure-‘A-1’ filed from the side of the petitioners through their supplementary affidavit. The learned Advocate also submits in his concluding submission that the trial court as well as the appellate court without going into the merit of the suit and proper assessment of the evidence in its true perspective committed an error of law resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice and as such the impugned judgment and decree is liable to be interfered with. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 27.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">             </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">As against the aforesaid submission of the learned Advocate for the petitioners, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the opposite parties, opposing the Rule controverted the argument advanced from the side of the learned counsel for the petitioners and submits that, neither the trial court nor the appellate court during disposal of the original suit and its subsequent appeal committed any illegality or irregularity. The learned Advocate further submits that both the courts below concurrently in their observation and finding held after proper assessment of evidence and appreciation of law that the basic document of the plaintiff i.e. the sub-kabala deed dated 27.09.1978 allegedly executed and registered by the father of the defendant No.1 Jotish Jaladash is a forged instrument and it was not executed and registered by the alleged vendor Jotish Jaladash in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant No.7. The learned Advocate also submits that in the pleading of the defendant No.1 there is a clear recital that his father did not transfer the suit property in favour of the plaintiff and he was a literate person and used to perform his day to day work by putting his signature in case of necessity. The defendant also denied the execution of the kabala deed by his father and it is the case of the defendant No.1 that his father being a literate person used to put his signature not L.T.I. and the plaintiff’s witness No.1 not at all denied the fact that, Jotish Jaladash was a literate person, rather; he expressed his ignorance about that fact. The learned Advocate after referring some decisions of our Apex Court reported in 43 DLR (AD)82, 2 BLC (AD)92 and 5 MLR (AD) 316 submits that the concurrent findings of the courts below with regard to the facts of the case cannot be interfered with in absence of misreading or non-reading of evidence or non-consideration of material facts resulting in an error in the decision failure of justice inasmuch as the findings of facts are immune from interference in the revsional jurisdiction of this Court save and except the above mentioned illegalities and the instant case nowhere it is found that the appellate court during disposal of the appeal committed any such illegality or infirmity or misreading and non-reading of evidence or non-consideration of material facts resulting in an error in the decision occasioning failure of justice, and as such the impugned judgment and decree cannot be interfered with.
