He argues that in view of the above position of law, their action as arbitrators and passing the interim Order is outside their jurisdiction and as such it should be declared without lawful authority.

In elaborating her above count of submissions, she submits that the provisions of clause 20 of the Deed of Partnership and the e-Mail correspondences between the petitioner and his partner related to the nomination and formation of arbitration team were all written in English where the term ‘<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">arbitrator</span>’ has been used at all the times and the term “mediator” was never used for a single time whatsoever in any form. Then Ms. Huq places the provisions of Section 6 of the Arbitration Act in tandem with referring the case of Joinal Abedin Jamal Vs Noor Afzal 63 DLR 432, and submits that, without prejudice to the other submissions, if it is presumed that the arbitration clause has not been invoked by the respondent no. 4, the petitioner, vide Section 6 of the Arbitration Act, has waived his right to object as he has proceeded with the arbitration without stating his objection to such noncompliance of invoking the arbitration clause without undue delay. Ms. Huq next places before this Court the arbitration agreement dated 12.03.2018 executed by the petitioner and his partner, and submits that it was prepared in consultation with all the parties with mutually agreed terms and conditions and was properly executed on a non-judicial stamp and, by its clause 9, the arbitrators were authorized to award decisions binding upon both the parties. By taking this Court through Section 17(a) &amp; (b) of the Arbitration Act, she submits that since the arbitral tribunal comprising the respondent nos. 1, 2 and 3 is legally empowered to rule on its own jurisdiction on whether there is existence of a valid arbitration agreement or not and, also, whether the arbitral tribunal was properly constituted or not, the petitioner ought to have approached the arbitral tribunal, at first. She argues that the petitioner has come to the wrong forum to challenge the validity of the agreement dated 12.03.2018 as it falls under the purview of the decision of the arbitral tribunal. By placing the provisions of Section 22 of the Arbitration Act, Ms. Huq submits that the petitioner is deliberately trying to confuse this Court with regard to the terms ‘mediators’ and ‘arbitrators’ inasmuch as the law mandates the arbitrators to play the role of mediators for an amicable settlement and, accordingly, the arbitrators initially approached as the mediators to settle the dispute amicably. She continues to submit that there is no fundamental distinction between the terminologies ‘mediator’ and ‘arbitrator’ if the same are translated into Bengali, because as per the Dictionary published by the Bangla Academy, the meaning of both the words ‘mediation’ and ‘arbitration’ is “</span><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyMJ; mso-ansi-language: EN;">ga¨¯’Zv</span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">”.

Also, the members of the arbitral tribunal are their close relatives (the Chairman of the arbitral tribunal is a cousin, one member, namely, Mrs. Ayesha Huq is a full sister, and another member, namely, Mrs. Rokeya Din is a niece of the partners of the MSC). This Court eventually told all of them in the open-Court that since it has come to the knowledge of this Court that the partners of the MSC are the sons of such a late lamented<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>person to whom the judiciary of Bangladesh is indebted for his contribution in law reporting of this country, which he undertook immediately after establishment of the Dhaka High Court, by which the Judges and the lawyers of this country are being greatly benefited, this Court, therefore, instead of letting this matter to be dragged on for long, wishes to resolve the dispute between the parties amicably and, accordingly, asked them to sit together and put in their best efforts to find out a solution. It was opined by this Court that the criminal case filed by the petitioner in connection with this matter appears to this Court to be very unusual inasmuch as the petitioner and the respondent no. 4 being the partners of the MSC are the joint owners of the goods, which are alleged to have been stolen by a partner, namely, respondent no. 4, and there is no scope to record a criminal case against a person on the allegation of stealing of the goods which belonged to him. It was also commented by this Court that in the case MH Khondker Vs AW Qazilbash 20 DLR 945, this Court has laid down a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">ratio</em> that during pendency of any suit/case, if any party seeks to create pressure upon the other side, it amounts to interference with the course of justice. This Court made the observation that since the dispute among them is with regard to the business owned jointly by them and the District Judge’s Court of Dhaka and this Court were in seisin of this matter, filing of criminal case alleging removal/stealing goods of the said business amounts to committing contempt of Court. This Court has taken judicial notice of the fact that the criminal case was filed immediately after obtaining the Order of stay from this Court on the operation of the Order passed by the learned District Judge enforcing the arbitral tribunal’s interim Order dated 02.08.2018. When this Court asked the petitioner of the instant application, Mr. Ghulam Mohiuddin (Bhutto), about the filing of the criminal case, in reply thereto, he told that in fact he did not have any intention to file the criminal case; he only wanted to lodge a General Diary (GD). All the three arbitrators contended that as the senior family members, all that they want to see that these petitioners’ business is saved and, with this aim, they were trying their best to resolve the dispute without causing further damage not only to the business, but also to their personal and family relationship. In reply to a query made by this Court as to whether it would be possible for them to continue with their duties as the arbitrators, they informed this Court that they would be happy to resign for the sake of an acceptable resolution of the dispute. Finally, while the arbitrators opted to leave the matter upon this Court for finding a better solution even at the cost of reconstituting the tribunal either replacing them all or keeping anyone whom the Court considers to be useful, serviceable and acceptable, the learned Advocates of the petitioner and the respondent no. 4 insisted upon this Court that they expect a verdict from this Court as to the legality of the formation of the arbitral tribunal and the validity of the impugned interim Order. Under the circumstances, this Court decided to proceed with the hearing which culminated into delivering of the instant full-fledged Judgment. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Upon hearing the learned Advocates for both the sides, on perusal of the petitioner’s application as well as the affidavits filed by the respondents together with their annexures and having read the relevant statutory laws and case-laws cited from the various Law Journals, it appears to this Court that the following issues are to be adjudicated upon by this Court; (i) whether there is existence of any arbitration agreement between the partners of the MSC i.e. between the present petitioner and the respondent no. 4, (ii) whether the respondent nos. 1, 2 &amp; 3 were appointed as the arbitrators or as the mediators, and whether the arbitral tribunal was formed as per the provisions of law, (iii) whether the arbitral tribunal was competent to pass the impugned interim Order, whether the interim Order was a proper and legal one, and whether the interim Order passed by the arbitral tribunal can be challenged before the High Court Division, (iv) whether the law permits the petitioner to challenge the legality and propriety of formation of the arbitration tribunal comprising the respondent nos. 1, 2 &amp; 3 and, thereby, to question the performance of the respondent nos. 1, 2 &amp; 3 as the arbitrators, (v) whether the petitioner is competent to file the instant application during pendency of the Arbitration Miscellaneous Case before the Court of District Judge, (vi) whether this Court is competent to entertain and adjudicate upon the question relating to jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal, (vii) whether the petitioner has waived his right to challenge the appointment of the arbitrators and to object to the impugned interim Order, (viii) whether the present Members and the Chairman of arbitral tribunal should continue to perform their functions, (ix) whether this Court should constitute/create a new arbitral tribunal and (x) whether the Arbitration </span><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Miscellaneous Case No. 501/18 pending before the Court of District Judge, Dhaka should be kept in abeyance, so that the new arbitrators may review the impugned interim Order passed by the arbitration tribunal on 02.08.2018</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">Let me take up the first issue, namely, whether there is existence of any arbitration agreement between the partners of the MSC i.e. between the present petitioner and the respondent no. 4.

Beside the above-mentioned correspondences, </span></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">I have read all the e-Mail correspondences made by the petitioner with Mr. Afzal Husain Choudhury, wherefrom it transpires that the </span><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">respondent nos. 1, 2, &amp; 3 were nominated and appointed as the arbitrators as per the terms of clause no. 20 of the Partnership Deed dated 01.09.2012 and all the correspondences mentioned them as the arbitrators from the beginning of their assignment. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 109%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">Now, let me see on what basis the petitioner seeks to make out a case that the respondent nos. 1, 2 &amp; 3 have not been appointed as the arbitrators; they have been appointed as the mediators. Upon hearing the learned Advocate and examining the annexures appended to the instant petition, it transpires that the petitioner’s basis of such claim is the written agreement dated 12.03.2018 executed between the partners of the MSC (the petitioner &amp; the respondent no. 4) and all the three arbitrators, which was witnessed by two witnesses, namely, the wife of the petitioner and another person, who happens to be the common brother of the petitioner and the respondent no. 4. And, the reason for terming the arbitrators as the mediators is that the document (agreement dated 12.03.2018) incorporates the Bengali word ‘</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%; font-family: SutonnyMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: Mangal;">ga¨¯’ZvKvix</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 109%;">’. However, it is evident from the correspondences that the arbitration proceedings commenced in the first week of February, 2018 and, in course of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrators took a step to mediate the dispute in the month of March 2018 in an effort to resolve the dispute expeditiously and more effectively. Since the arbitrators are the close relatives of the petitioner as well as the respondent no. 4, the arbitrators’ above step appears to this Court to be bonafide and is also very much within the provisions of law, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Arbitration Act allows the arbitrators to opt for such a path. Section 22 of the Arbitration Act states that “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">it shall not be incompatible with an arbitration agreement for an arbitral tribunal to encourage settlement of the dispute otherwise than by arbitration and, with the agreement of all the parties, the arbitral tribunal may use mediation, conciliation or any other procedures at any time during the arbitral proceedings to encourage settlement</em>.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">More importantly, the agreement dated 12.03.2018 is written in Bengali and if the word ‘</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyBanglaMJ;">ga¨¯’ZvKvix</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">’ is translated from the Bengali to English, the Dictionary published by the Bangla Academy provides the meaning of the word ‘</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: SutonnyMJ; mso-bidi-font-family: Mangal;">ga¨¯’ZvKvix</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">’ as both ‘arbitrator’ or ‘mediator’. That is to say that if the entire document is translated into English, the word in question would have to be read as ‘arbitrator’. Moreover, the fundamental difference between the mediators and the arbitrators are on the question of authority with powers related to giving a binding decision or not. And, since in clause 9 of the aforesaid arbitration agreement dated 12.03.2018 the arbitrators were authorized to award decisions binding upon both the parties, the agreement has the binding force upon the parties and, therefore, the agreement dated 12.03.2018 should be seen as a piece of document related to arbitration. </span><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Thus, this Court finds that the respondent nos. 1, 2 and 3 were never appointed as the mediators and they, having been appointed as the arbitrators, have constituted a lawful arbitral tribunal. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">18.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Let me now take up the issue no. 3, namely, </span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">whether the arbitral tribunal was competent to pass the impugned interim Order,</span> <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">whether the interim Order was a proper and legal one and whether the impugned Order is appealable/challengeable in this Court. </span><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">In view of the findings of this Court that the arbitral tribunal was formed as per the terms of the Partnership Deed dated 01.09.2012 and, also, in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act, this Court has no option but to hold that the arbitral tribunal was well competent to pass any interim Order as mandated by the provisions of Section 21 of the Arbitration Act. Since the Proviso to sub-Section (3) of Section 21 of the Arbitration Act empowers the arbitral tribunal to pass an <em>ex-parte</em> interim Order in an appropriate case to meet the exigency, I find the impugned interim Order to be proper and legal. Although the interim Order in question has been signed by two arbitrators namely, Mrs Ayesha Huq and Mr. Afzal Husain Chowdhury, but it cannot be termed as an irregular Order, let alone to be an illegal Order. Because, after constitution of an arbitral tribunal, it may proceed to function with only two arbitrators, unless the third arbitrator raises any objection to any step taken or Order passed by the two arbitrators. Since, the third arbitrator, Mrs Rokeya Din, has not raised any objection to the interim Order in question, the same is to be taken as a valid and lawful Order of a properly constituted arbitral tribunal. And, in view of the clear stipulations made in Section 21(1) of the Arbitration Act that no appeal shall lie against any interim Order passed by the arbitral tribunal, an aggrieved party neither can approach this Court directly, nor the propriety and legality of an interim Order passed by the arbitral tribunal can be challenged in the form of seeking a declaration from a civil Court of first instance because of the prohibition imposed by the Legislature in Section 7 of the Arbitration Act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 110%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 6.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">19.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 110%;">I would now take up the fourth issue, namely, whether the law permits the petitioner to challenge the legality and propriety of formation of the arbitration tribunal comprising the respondent nos. 1, 2 &amp; 3 and, thereby, to question the performance of the respondent nos. 1, 2 &amp; 3 as the arbitrators.

The first aspect is that through its non-obstante provisions, it seeks to herald that irrespective of any statements, stipulations and provisions to the contrary made in the Arbitration Act, or any other law, the provisions of Section 53 of the Arbitration Act shall stand. The second aspect is - if any party to the arbitration agreement registers its name in a Court for any purpose, that Court shall assume jurisdiction over the arbitration agreement and arbitral agreement in whose connection a party have moved before the Court. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">28.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Now, the question comes up for consideration as to whether the jurisdiction conferred specifically upon, and the power vested exclusively in, the High Court Division vide Sections 7A, 10, 12, 14(4) &amp; 20 of the Arbitration Act can be discarded by a non-obstante provision, and that too for the purpose of endowing a sub-ordinate Court with the said jurisdiction and power of the High Court Division. While as a normal course of action, the Legislature does not go for enactment of a law by which the superior Court’s jurisdiction and power will be scrapped or curtailed in order to enrich and empower the sub-ordinate Courts with the said jurisdiction and power, yet if the Legislature in their wisdom considers it necessary, they are competent to enact such law. However, this sort of enactment is normally made by the Legislature in clearer and specific expressions and, furthermore, in passing such laws the Parliament usually tables some explanations before the House.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">29.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Given the fact that in Section 53 of the Arbitration Act, the Legislature has incorporated the word “</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; font-family: SutonnyBanglaMJ;">†Kv‡bv Av`vj‡Z</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">” (in a Court), and Section 2(b) of the Arbitration Act defines “Court” means “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">District Judge’s Court and includes Additional District Judge’s Court appointed by the Government for discharging the functions of District Judge’s Court under this Act through Gazette notification</em>”, it is difficult for anyone to comprehend the literal meaning. Because, though in ordinary sense the High Court Division is also a Court, but the Legislature consciously has not included the High Court Division as the ‘Court’ in Section 2(b), rather the Parliament has provided a separate definition of the ‘High Court Division’ in Section 2(q) in the following terms; “<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">High Court Division means High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh</em>”. Therefore, this Court is led to hold that ‘Court’ means District Judge Court and, thus, the literal meaning should be that whenever any party to an arbitration agreement will take recourse to the Court of District Judge of any particular District, the said District Judge Court shall have the exclusive jurisdiction over the said arbitration matter up to the period of final termination of the arbitral proceedings, and not any other District Judge Court. The specific jurisdictions conferred upon the High Court Division, thus, are not meant to have been taken away by the provisions of Section 53 of <span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt;">the Arbitration Act.

line-height: 105%;">From a minute reading of the entire provisions of Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, my understanding is that sub-Section (1) of Section 20 of the Arbitration Act is the provision which enables and empowers the High Court Division to entertain an application from any party to the arbitration agreement regarding jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, subject to fulfilling the conditions set out in sub-Section (2) of Section 20 of the Arbitration Act. Thus, a petitioner, who has invoked Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, is under a mandatory obligation to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>satisfy the High Court Division that all the conditions stipulated in clauses (a) to (c) of Section 20(2) of the Arbitration Act are satisfied before entertaining or registering an application. In other words, the power invested in the High Court Division for entertaining an application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act is not an independent power, for, it can be exercised by the High Court Division only upon being satisfied that (a) the determination of the question is likely to produce substantial savings in costs, (b) the application was submitted without any delay and (c) there is good reason why the matter should be decided by the Court. Therefore, the High Court Division’s power having been circumscribed by Section 20(2) of the Arbitration Act, an application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act should be taken into account by the Court only after being satisfied as to fulfilling the conditions set out in clauses (a) to (c) of Section 20(2) of the Arbitration Act. Additionally, the petitioner is also required to state the reasons/arguments/ grounds, based on which the High Court Division would dispose of the application.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">34.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">From a meticulous scrutiny of the averments made in this application and careful examination of the annexed papers, I did not find that filing of the instant application before the High Court Division helped the petitioner or the respondents to save costs, nor did I find that the application was filed without squandering time inasmuch as the interim Order was passed by the arbitral tribunal on 02.08.2018, whereas the present application has been filed on 30.08.2018, save and except finding that the petitioner has placed before this Court some reasons as to why the question of jurisdiction should be adjudicated upon by this Court. However, Section 20(2) of the Arbitration Act requires that the petitioner must simultaneously satisfy all the three conditions laid down in clauses (a) to (c) thereof, for, none of the clauses (a) to (c) ends up with the word ‘or’. Since the petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court about how he is saving costs by invoking the provisions of Section 20 of the Arbitration Act and, also, since the petitioner approached this Court after nearly one month of passing the interim Order of the arbitral tribunal, I find that the petitioner ought to have challenged the jurisdiction of the tribunal before the arbitration tribunal. Therefore, this Court is led to hold that the instant application cannot be entertained for adjudication upon the question of jurisdiction of the tribunal and the interim Order passed by this Court at the time of admission of this matter on 03.09.2018, is liable to be vacated.

Since in this case, the petitioner is raising question about appointment of arbitrators towards the formation of the arbitral tribunal in question, the respondents are taking a plea that the petitioner, by not raising the objection immediately after knowing about the appointment of the arbitrators or soon after passing the impugned interim order dated 02.08.2018, has waived his right.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt list .5in; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">38.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">Upon skimming through the provisions (a) relating to appointment of arbitrators, (b) regarding raising challenge as to holding the position of the arbitrator and (c) about raising question as to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, it appears to this Court that no time-frame is prescribed in the law for raising an objection as to appointment of the members of the arbitral tribunal, nor is there any such stipulation in the arbitration agreement executed by the partners of the MSC (the petitioner and the respondent no. 4) and, therefore, the only tool to assess the time limit is whether the petitioner has made undue delay in raising objection as to the appointment of arbitrators and formation of the arbitral tribunal. This Court’s view is that since the parties to the ongoing arbitration proceedings are yet to file their respective written pleadings before the arbitral tribunal, there has not been any such delay in raising the objection as to appointment of the arbitrators or as to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal which can be termed as undue or unreasonable. In the cited case of Joinal Abedin Jamal Vs Noor Afza 63 DLR 432, the aggrieved party raised objection as to appointment of the arbitrator after passing the award by the arbitral tribunal, and that too before the Execution Court, which led this Court to hold that by not raising the objection as to the appointment of the arbitrator before the arbitral tribunal within a reasonable time, the Court deems that the party has waived his right to raise such objection as to the appointment of arbitrators or jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 105%; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: 30.0pt list .5in; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">39.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">           </span></span></span></strong><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 105%;">I would finally take up the last three issues, being issue nos. viii, ix &amp; x, together for the sake of their better resolution.

The findings of this Court on the 7 (seven) issues so far dealt with by this Court are: (a) there is existence of an arbitration agreement between the partners of the MSC (i.e. between the petitioner and the respondent no. 4) and they are bound to resolve their dispute through the arbitration, (b) the arbitral tribunal is a valid one and the tribunal lawfully passed the impugned interim Order, (c) for resolution of the petitioner’s grievance, the apparent fora are either the arbitral tribunal for invocation of the provisions of Section 14(2) of the Arbitration Act and Section 17 of the Arbitration Act or the High Court Division for seeking a ruling on the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, (d) the petitioner’s instant application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act cannot be entertained by this Court, (e) the petitioner has not waived his right to object to the appointment of arbitrator nor has he waived his right to raise objection as to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and (f) the Court of District Judge is not competent to hear and adjudicate upon the issues of appointment of arbitrators or jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.

(i) to (vii), this Court expressed its opinion in the open-Court addressing the parties of this case that although this Court has held hereinbefore that the tribunal has been formed lawfully and the interim Order passed by the said tribunal is also valid, however, this Court is going to afford this petitioner Mr. Ghulam Mohiuddin (Bhutto) an opportunity to approach the tribunal with an application for reviewing the tribunal’s Order dated 02.08.2018. At this juncture, this Court reminded both the parties that as per the prayers of both the parties this Court has adjudicated upon the core issues. Now, it is up to the parties to resolve the dispute either through the arbitral tribunal constituted by the present arbitrators or through reconstituting the arbitral tribunal as per the suggestions put forward by the arbitrators when they appeared before this Court. This Court opined that it would be fair for all the parties if the tribunal is reconstituted with one nominated person from each of the side and the Chairman is appointed by this Court. If they wish to resolve the dispute through a reconstituted arbitral tribunal by appointing any one from the concerned arbitrators, they must first take consent from the present arbitrator/s and, in the event that s/he would be comfortable to work with the newly appointed members and Chairman, only then his/her name may be proposed by the parties as the member of the reconstituted tribunal. In reply thereto, after consulting with the present arbitrators and also receiving the instructions from their respective clients, Mr. Tanvir Parvez, the learned Advocate for the petitioner proposes the name of Mr. Debborata Laha, son of Promod Chandra Laha &amp; Maya Rani Banik, RM Center (4<sup>th</sup> Floor), 101 Gulshan Avenue, Dhaka-1212 (Contact: 01978-004545) as the arbitrator of the petitioner, Mr. Ghulam Mohiuddin (Bhutto) and Ms. Faria Huq, the learned Advocate for the respondent no. 4, proposes the name of Mr. Afzal Husain Choudhury, son of late Abdul Hossain Chowdhury, House No. 55, Road No. 4A, Dhanmondi, Dhaka-1209 (Contact: 01714-004587) as the arbitrator of the respondent no. 4, Mr. Zahed Obaidul Huq Chowdhury. Pursuant to obtaining two names from the two sides, this Court asked both the sides as to whether they wish to appoint the Chairman of the tribunal from the retired Hon’ble Chief Justices or from the former Hon’ble Judges of either Division of the Supreme Court or from the learned Advocates of this Bar. It was notified to them that an Hon’ble Chief Justice (retired) should be remunerated more or less Tk. 25,00,000/- (twenty five lacs) and an Hon’ble Judge (retired) of either Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh should not be paid less than Tk. 10,00,000/- (ten lacs). They opted to appoint a former Hon’ble Chief Justice. This Court then announced Mr. Md.
