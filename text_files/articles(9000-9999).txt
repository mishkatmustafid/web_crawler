Even the legal personalities like the body corporate or corporations and companies are under the range of the law of the land. The corporations though, not being natural personalities, are also under the scope of the law of the land. They are also detained responsible for the offences and civil wrongs. But several times question arises as to the choice of law of the land under which the corporations are to be governed.</p><p>For that purpose, it has to be understood whether the law of the nation which is going to be applied, has the jurisdiction over the corporation and related matters. In other words, it has to be understood whether the corporation has domicile of the nation whose law is to be applied.</p><p>In general a corporation is a legal entity with the nature of the individualism. A corporation may accurately be called a company: maybe however, a company ought to not necessarily be called a corporation, which has distinct characteristics. According to Black’s Law Dictionary a company means a corporation- or, less commonly, an association, partnership or union-that carries on industrial enterprise.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The defining feature of a corporation is its legal independence from the people who create it. If a corporation fails, its shareholder will lose the money and employee will lose the jobs. Shareholders, however owing a part piece of the company, are not liable for debt that remains owing to the corporation’s creditors. This rule is called limited liability and this why corporation end with “Ltd”.</p><p>“….only a juristic figment of the imagination, lacking both a body to be kicked and a soul to be dammed”<sup>2</sup></p><p>But despite this, corporations are recognized by the law to have rights and responsibility like actual people.</p><p><sup> </sup></p><p>1.       8 th edition (2004), ISBN 0-314-15199-0</p><p>2.       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Northern_Counties_Securities_Ltd._v._Jackson_%26_Steeple_Ltd.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Northern Counties Securities Ltd. v.

A partnership has no existence apart from its members. It is nothing but a collection of the Partners.<sup>6</sup> Corporation is a distinct legal persona existing independent of its member. By incorporation under the act, the company is vested with a corporate personality which is distinct from the members who compose it. One of the effect of incorporation is stated in section34 (2) of the act. Thus the company becomes a body corporate which is capable immediately of functioning as an incorporate individual. The enterprise acquires its own entity.<sup>7</sup> It becomes impersonalized. No one can say that he is the owner of the company. The business now belongs to an institute.</p><p>“The benefits following from incorporation can hardly be exaggerated. It is because of incorporation that the owner of the business ceases to trade in his own person. The company carries on the business, the liabilities are the company’s liabilities and the former owner is under no liability for anything the company does, although, as principal shareholder, he is able to take full advantage of profits which the company makes.<sup>8</sup></p><p>3.       For example, South African Constitution Art 8,especially Art(4)</p><p>4.       The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law.

However this latter feature is not the case in most European jurisdiction, where employees participate in their companies.</p><p>6.       This basic difference between a company and a partnership has been explained by GHULAM HASAN J in Bacha F. Guzdar v CIT (1955),See also partnership act 1932 which says that collectively the partners are known as a partnership firm.</p><p>7.       Company Law.Avtar Singh, 14<sup>th</sup> edn, pg:4, Para no:1</p><p>8.       Palmer’s PRIVATE COMPANIES , PG:13 (42<sup>nd</sup> Edn,1961)</p><p>The following further passage from Palmer<sup>9</sup> was cited by WADHWA J.<sup>10</sup></p><p><sup> </sup></p><p>The principal that, apart from exceptional cases, the company is a body corporate, distinct from members, lies at the root of many of the most perplexing questions that beset company law. It is a fundamental or cardinal distinction-a distinction which must be firmly grasped. This principle is thrown into clear relief by contrasting an incorporated company with a partnership, for under English law a firm or partnership is not a separate entity from its members.”</p><p><em>In English and Indian law, just like the law of other Common Law countries, it is permissible in a limited class of cases to ‘pierce the corporate veil’; when this is done, the person or entity who is found to be the alter ego of the corporation can be held liable for the liability of the corporate entity.</em><em> </em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limited liability of the shareholders</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span></strong></p><p>“The privilege of limiting liability for business debts is one of the principal advantages of doing business under the corporate form of the organization”<sup>11</sup>The company being a separate person .is the owner of its own assets and bound by its liability. Members even as a whole are neither the owner of the company’s undertaking, nor liable for its debts. Where the subscribers exercise the choice of registering the company with limited liability, the members’ liability becomes limited or restricted to the nominal value of the shares taken by them or the amount guaranteed by them. No member is bound to contribute anything more than the nominal value of the shares held by him.<sup>12</sup>In a partnership; on the other hand, the liability of the partners for the debts of the business is unlimited. They are bound to meet, without any limit, all the business obligations of the firm. The whole fortune of partner is at stake, as the creditors can levy execution even on his private property. Speaking of the advantage of trading with limited liability, BUCKLEY J observed: <sup>13</sup></p><p>“The statutes relating to limited liability have probably done more than any legislation of the last fifty years to further the commercial prosperity of the country.

One of the primary and accepted motivations behind incorporating a company is to limit personal risks by obtaining the benefit of limited liability”</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shares:</span></strong></p><p>Stockholder’s equity in corporation is generally made up of large units of shares; within a given case of stock each share is exactly equal to every other share. Each owner’s interest is determined by the number of shares he or she possesses.<sup>14</sup>Each share of stock has certain rights and privileges that can be restricted only by special contract at the time the shares are issued. One must examine the articles of incorporation, stock certificates and the provision of the state law to ascertain such restriction on or variation from the standards rights and privileges. In the absence of restrictive provisions, each share carries the following rights: <sup>15</sup></p><p>1.      To share proportionately in profits and looses.</p><p>2.      To share proportionately in management</p><p>3.      To share proportionately in corporate assets upon liquidation</p><p>4.      To share proportionately in any new issues of stock of the same class- called the preemptive right.</p><p>The first three rights are to be expected in the ownership of any business. The last may be used in a corporation to protect each shareholder’s proportional interest in the enterprise. Without this there is another from named <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transferable share</span></strong>. When joint stock companies were established the great object was that their shares could be capable of being easily transferred.<sup>16 </sup>According the Companies Act in Section 82 declares: “The shares or debentures or other interest of any number in a company shall be movable property, transferable in the manner provided by the article of the company”.</p><p>14.    “If a company has but one class of stock dividend into 1000 shares, a person owing 500 shares controls one half of the ownership interest of the corporation; one holding 10 share has a one-hundredth interest”.-Intermediate Accounting system (11 Edn); 2007-2008; Donald E.

This provides liquidity to the investor and stability to the company.<sup>17</sup> In a partnership, on the other hand, a partner cannot transfer his share in the capital of the firm except with the unanimous consent of all the partners. If a transfer is made against the will of the partner, the transferee does not become a partner, although he has some rights in the dissolution of the firm.<sup>18</sup></p><p><sup> </sup></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delegated Management:</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p>The corporate sector is capable of attracting the growing cadre of professional manager. The position that the director occupy in a corporate enterprise is not easy to explain.<sup>19</sup>They are professional men hired by the company to direct its affairs. Yet they are not the servants of the company. They are rather the officers of the company. “A director is not a servant of any master. He cannot be described as a servant of the company or of anyone.<sup>20</sup> “A director is in fact a director or controller of the company’s affairs. He is not a servant.<sup>21</sup>A director may, however, work as an employee in a different capacity. For example, in Lee v Lee’s Air Framing Ltd.<sup>22</sup></p><p>The companies act makes no effort to define their position. Sub-Section (13) of Section 2 only provides that” director includes any person occupying the position of a director, by whatever name called”. The Nigerian Act carries a better definition:”Directors of a company registered under this act<sup>23</sup> are persons duly appointed by the company to direct and manage the business of the company”.<sup>24 </sup>Section 291 declare that “subject to the provisions of the act, the board of directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such powers and to do all such acts and things as the company is authorized to exercise and do”. <sup>25</sup></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>17.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>I. Thesis Statement: Adoption is the best choice you can make for all the advantages it comes with and abortion can cause infections and possible complications later and parenting is too expensive for any teenager and it also prevents you from enjoying your young life.</p><p>II. Parenting comes with many hassles and requires at least twenty years out of your own life to cater for your child’s needs. (Topic Sentence).</p><p>Some teen mothers are forced to live on their own because their parents don’t want the added financial and emotional strain of a grandchild in the house. (Beyer 3).</p><p>Months after the baby is born, many of the people who are now lavishing attention on Jade will return to the normal rhythm of their lives. But Jade will remain the center of attention for at least one person – her baby. (Beyer 3).</p><p>She must be committed and informed enough to be able to guide and care for her child for many years after his or her birth. (Beyer 4).</p><p>Every mother, no matter how able or strong, needs a lot of help for the first few weeks after her baby is born. (Beyer 4).</p><p>III. Some abortions occur in a natural way whereas the rest of the times, it’s based on a decision. (Topic Sentence).</p><p>More than one-half of the women who decide to have an abortion are in their twenties. Approximately 20 percent are under age 19. Therefore, teens make up about one in five of all abortions. (Kittleson 15).</p><p>Although abortion remains legal, it is not an acceptable form of contraception. (Kittleson 21).</p><p>Risks involved with suction curettage and D and E include uterine infection, bleeding, or incomplete removal of the uterine contents. Most doctors require a follow-up visit to ensure there were no complications. (Kittleson 16).</p><p>Side effects associated with the abortion pill are heavy bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and severe uterine cramping. (Simpson 11).</p><p>IV. Adoption is the best option because the adoptive parents will pay for all the medical expenses and you can continue living your teenage life with no guilt or a baby. (Topic Sentence).</p><p>In some private adoption agencies, the adoptive couple covers the expenses of your pregnancy and delivery. (Simpson 21).</p><p>A primary purpose of adoption was to protect the reputation of the mother and her family from the shame of a birth out of wedlock. (Dudley 18).</p><p>Sharon tried not to think about the baby growing inside her because it only made her decision to give him up that much harder. She pretended she was at the home because she was ill, an illness that would go away in a few more months. (Simpson 22).</p><p>Believe it or not, the baby’s father must sign the adoption papers too, waiving his parental rights. (Simpson 27).</p><p>VI. Conclusion</p><p>Teenage Pregnancy Options</p><p>Teenagers make many decisions in their life and choosing to be sexually active is something that is definitely going to affect them both mentally and physically. Once pregnant, the girl has to be considering her options and what would be the best for her and the baby now inside her. Adoption is the best choice to make for all the advantages it comes with where as abortion can cause infections and possible complications later and parenting is too expensive for any teenager and it also prevents one from enjoying an individual’s young life.</p><p>Now that there are many types of contraceptive methods available to this generation, more than ever, more teens are getting reckless and do not realize that no one is one hundred percent protected and that there still is a slight chance of getting pregnant. Most run into a dangerous risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease and are not ready to deal with the consequences. It is not that these teens are not aware of diseases or getting pregnant; instead are just ignorant, plain and simple. Teenage pregnancy is something that will stick with any girl for the rest of her life and no matter what option one will choose, it will never be forgotten.</p><p>Parenting comes with many hassles and requires at least twenty years out of your own life to cater for your child’s needs. Some teen mothers are forced to live on their own because his or her parents do not want the added financial and emotional strain of a grandchild in the house (Beyer 3). There are cultures where a girl is looked down upon if pregnant at a young age and chooses to raise the child herself and no one dares to talk to her. The whole process is indeed stressful not just for the mother, but the whole family; however, the family should be there for the young girl in her desperate time of need. It is also during this period of time that the daughter sees her parents’ true colors and hopes that they choose to support her every step of the way because without it, she might not be able to do it. Every mother, no matter how able or strong, needs a lot of help for the first few weeks after her baby is born (Beyer 4). Confusion is one of the many emotions first time parents feel, no matter how young or old and making choices does not only affect the individual now, but the child too. Months after the baby is born, many of the people who are now lavishing attention on the mother will return to the normal rhythm of their lives (Beyer 3). The actual parenting will now be a nightmare and the mother will need a lot of guidance on what to do from there and she will need to learn to make the baby part of her life if she had not already. Having a new member of the family might be exciting for a while until the baby’s demands are no longer tolerable, so it is necessary to think about how one will feel in the long run. She must be committed and informed enough to be able to guide and care for her child for many years after his or her birth (Brian 136). Sometimes the child’s mother might get frustrated for she will feel like she is being told what to do and now takes responsibility for the child’s actions as well as hers. She might not know what to do in the situation and instead let that anger out on her child and he/she will grow up physically abused and will also struggle to live a normal life.</p><p>Some abortions occur in a natural way whereas the rest of the times, it is based on a decision. More than one-half of the women who decide to have an abortion are in their twenties. Approximately twenty percent are under age nineteen. Therefore, teens make up about one in five of all abortions (Kittleson 15). The statistics show that abortion among teens really is a part of reality and is not a joke. Although abortion remains legal, it is not an acceptable form of contraception (Edelson 81). The thought that one will get an abortion if she were to fall pregnant is not something that should even cross a girl’s mind for first, it is illegal and second, it is inhumane to kill another living being for one’s own selfish reasons. Risks involved with suction curettage and D and E include uterine infection, bleeding, or incomplete removal of the uterine contents. Most doctors require a follow-up visit to ensure there were no complications (Kittleson 16). Dilation and evacuation, or curettage D and E, is usually done within the first twelve weeks of the pregnancy. To figure out the size of the uterus, an ultrasound is done before the procedure and the cervix is also dilated to prevent any injury during the surgery. It is not just a procedure that is done and will never have to worry about again. Regular visits to a doctor on a regular basis are a must to guarantee that there is not anything abnormal which will be hazardous to one’s health. Side effects associated with the abortion pill are heavy bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and severe uterine cramping (Simpson 11). There is never an easy way out of pregnancy and either way the girl will suffer, either mentally or physically and this proves it. It was certainly preventable and it gave the girl nothing but trouble, pain and disgrace.</p><p>The best choice is adoption because the adoptive parents will take care of everything, the individual will know that the baby is in good hands and can continue living their teenage life with no guilt and no baby. In some private adoption agencies, the adoptive couple covers the expenses of your pregnancy and delivery (Simpson 21). Being pregnant and then managing a job to pay for the expenses causes stress for both mother and baby. Certain adoptions, however, take a load off of the mother’s shoulders and there is no need to further worry about the thousands of dollars she would have had to pay the hospital for the baby’s delivery. A primary purpose of adoption was to protect the reputation of the mother and her family from the shame of a birth out of wedlock (Dudley 18). This covers the conflict with culture and though things might have changed nine months along the way, there is nothing stopping the young girl from having her life back. She tried not to think about the baby growing inside her because it only made her decision to give him up that much harder. She pretended she was at the home because she was ill, an illness that would go away in a few more months (Simpson 22). It can be a tough decision to give up someone that one was so close to and had nurtured, but when an individual knows that she cannot accommodate a young baby, but also do not want to hurt it, it is the better alternative. An advantage of picking adoption is that it is not like abortion where one feels guilty and keeps wondering “what if…” and is a lot less expensive than parenting. Believe it or not, the baby’s father must sign the adoption papers too, waiving his parental rights (Simpson 27). It is not only under the mother’s interest what is best for the baby. The point of having the father sign the adoption papers is for the state to know that he is aware that his son/daughter is being adopted and also has the right to object.</p><p>Young adults do not always know the difference between right and wrong and will learn from their mistakes eventually and teenage pregnancy is just one of them. It is one of the many obstacles that these unfortunate teenagers have to overcome and though it may seem impossible at times, they will make it alive for there are options that will help them deal with it.

(Simpson 22).</p><p>Believe it or not, the baby’s father must sign the adoption papers too, waiving his parental rights. (Simpson 27).</p><p>VI. Conclusion</p><p><strong>Teenage Pregnancy Options</strong></p><p>Teenagers make many decisions in their life and choosing to be sexually active is something that is definitely going to affect them both mentally and physically. Once pregnant, the girl has to be considering her options and what would be the best for her and the baby now inside her. Adoption is the best choice to make for all the advantages it comes with where as abortion can cause infections and possible complications later and parenting is too expensive for any teenager and it also prevents one from enjoying an individual’s young life.</p><p>Now that there are many types of contraceptive methods available to this generation, more than ever, more teens are getting reckless and do not realize that no one is one hundred percent protected and that there still is a slight chance of getting pregnant. Most run into a dangerous risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease and are not ready to deal with the consequences. It is not that these teens are not aware of diseases or getting pregnant; instead are just ignorant, plain and simple. Teenage pregnancy is something that will stick with any girl for the rest of her life and no matter what option one will choose, it will never be forgotten.</p><p>Parenting comes with many hassles and requires at least twenty years out of your own life to cater for your child’s needs. Some teen mothers are forced to live on their own because his or her parents do not want the added financial and emotional strain of a grandchild in the house (Beyer 3). There are cultures where a girl is looked down upon if pregnant at a young age and chooses to raise the child herself and no one dares to talk to her. The whole process is indeed stressful not just for the mother, but the whole family; however, the family should be there for the young girl in her desperate time of need. It is also during this period of time that the daughter sees her parents’ true colors and hopes that they choose to support her every step of the way because without it, she might not be able to do it. Every mother, no matter how able or strong, needs a lot of help for the first few weeks after her baby is born (Beyer 4). Confusion is one of the many emotions first time parents feel, no matter how young or old and making choices does not only affect the individual now, but the child too. Months after the baby is born, many of the people who are now lavishing attention on the mother will return to the normal rhythm of their lives (Beyer 3). The actual parenting will now be a nightmare and the mother will need a lot of guidance on what to do from there and she will need to learn to make the baby part of her life if she had not already. Having a new member of the family might be exciting for a while until the baby’s demands are no longer tolerable, so it is necessary to think about how one will feel in the long run.

It has neither a mind nor a body of its own”-explain and illustrate</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span></p><p>In the eye of law, everyone is under the province and scope of the statutory provisions.</p><p>Any one cannot get away the control of law of the territory. Even the legal personalities like the body corporate or corporations and companies are under the range of the law of the land. The corporations though, not being natural personalities, are also under the scope of the law of the land. They are also detained responsible for the offences and civil wrongs. But several times question arises as to the choice of law of the land under which the corporations are to be governed.</p><p>For that purpose, it has to be understood whether the law of the nation which is going to be applied, has the jurisdiction over the corporation and related matters. In other words, it has to be understood whether the corporation has domicile of the nation whose law is to be applied.</p><p>In general a corporation is a legal entity with the nature of the individualism. A corporation may accurately be called a company: maybe however, a company ought to not necessarily be called a corporation, which has distinct characteristics. According to Black’s Law Dictionary a company means a corporation- or, less commonly, an association, partnership or union-that carries on industrial enterprise.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The defining feature of a corporation is its legal independence from the people who create it. If a corporation fails, its shareholder will lose the money and employee will lose the jobs. Shareholders, however owing a part piece of the company, are not liable for debt that remains owing to the corporation’s creditors. This rule is called limited liability and this why corporation end with “Ltd”.</p><p>“….only a juristic figment of the imagination, lacking both a body to be kicked and a soul to be dammed”<sup>2</sup></p><p>But despite this, corporations are recognized by the law to have rights and responsibility like actual people.</p><p><sup> </sup></p><p>1.       8 th edition (2004), ISBN 0-314-15199-0</p><p>2.       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Northern_Counties_Securities_Ltd._v._Jackson_%26_Steeple_Ltd.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Northern Counties Securities Ltd. v.

They may trace back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Thurlow,_1st_Baron_Thurlow" title="Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow">Lord Chancellor Thurlow</a> (1731–1806), who is said to have asked rhetorically, “did you ever expect a corporation to have a conscience, when it has no soul to be damned and no body to be kicked?” Though it seems his exact phrase was, “Corporations have neither bodies to be punished, nor souls to be condemned; they therefore do as they like.” John Poynder Literary Extracts (1844) vol. 1, p. 2 or 268</p><p>Corporation can exercise human rights against real individuals and state,<sup> 3 </sup>and they may be responsible for human rights violation.<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup> </sup></p><p>The four defining characteristics of the modern corporation are: <sup>5</sup></p><p><strong><em>Separate Legal Personality of the corporation</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Limited liability of the shareholders</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Shares</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Delegated Management, in other words, control of the company placed in the hands of a board of directors</em></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Separate Legal Personality of the corporation:</span></strong></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p><p>The outstanding feature of a company is its independent corporate existence. A partnership has no existence apart from its members. It is nothing but a collection of the Partners.<sup>6</sup> Corporation is a distinct legal persona existing independent of its member. By incorporation under the act, the company is vested with a corporate personality which is distinct from the members who compose it. One of the effect of incorporation is stated in section34 (2) of the act. Thus the company becomes a body corporate which is capable immediately of functioning as an incorporate individual. The enterprise acquires its own entity.<sup>7</sup> It becomes impersonalized. No one can say that he is the owner of the company. The business now belongs to an institute.</p><p>“The benefits following from incorporation can hardly be exaggerated. It is because of incorporation that the owner of the business ceases to trade in his own person. The company carries on the business, the liabilities are the company’s liabilities and the former owner is under no liability for anything the company does, although, as principal shareholder, he is able to take full advantage of profits which the company makes.<sup>8</sup></p><p>3.       For example, South African Constitution Art 8,especially Art(4)</p><p>4.       The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law.

However this latter feature is not the case in most European jurisdiction, where employees participate in their companies.</p><p>6.       This basic difference between a company and a partnership has been explained by GHULAM HASAN J in Bacha F.

This principle is thrown into clear relief by contrasting an incorporated company with a partnership, for under English law a firm or partnership is not a separate entity from its members.”</p><p><em>In English and Indian law, just like the law of other Common Law countries, it is permissible in a limited class of cases to ‘pierce the corporate veil’; when this is done, the person or entity who is found to be the alter ego of the corporation can be held liable for the liability of the corporate entity.</em><em> </em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limited liability of the shareholders</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span></strong></p><p>“The privilege of limiting liability for business debts is one of the principal advantages of doing business under the corporate form of the organization”<sup>11</sup>The company being a separate person .is the owner of its own assets and bound by its liability. Members even as a whole are neither the owner of the company’s undertaking, nor liable for its debts. Where the subscribers exercise the choice of registering the company with limited liability, the members’ liability becomes limited or restricted to the nominal value of the shares taken by them or the amount guaranteed by them. No member is bound to contribute anything more than the nominal value of the shares held by him.<sup>12</sup>In a partnership; on the other hand, the liability of the partners for the debts of the business is unlimited. They are bound to meet, without any limit, all the business obligations of the firm. The whole fortune of partner is at stake, as the creditors can levy execution even on his private property.

Each owner’s interest is determined by the number of shares he or she possesses.<sup>14</sup>Each share of stock has certain rights and privileges that can be restricted only by special contract at the time the shares are issued. One must examine the articles of incorporation, stock certificates and the provision of the state law to ascertain such restriction on or variation from the standards rights and privileges. In the absence of restrictive provisions, each share carries the following rights: <sup>15</sup></p><p>1.      To share proportionately in profits and looses.</p><p>2.      To share proportionately in management</p><p>3.      To share proportionately in corporate assets upon liquidation</p><p>4.      To share proportionately in any new issues of stock of the same class- called the preemptive right.</p><p>The first three rights are to be expected in the ownership of any business.

This provides liquidity to the investor and stability to the company.<sup>17</sup> In a partnership, on the other hand, a partner cannot transfer his share in the capital of the firm except with the unanimous consent of all the partners. If a transfer is made against the will of the partner, the transferee does not become a partner, although he has some rights in the dissolution of the firm.<sup>18</sup></p><p><sup> </sup></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delegated Management:</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p>The corporate sector is capable of attracting the growing cadre of professional manager.

9005	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">TECHNIQUES OF NEUTRALIZATION</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Matza argued that instead of crime being a feature of deviant values shared in criminal subcultures, in fact we all had so-called “subterranean values” that, for the most part, we managed to control and inhibit.  He argued that criminals use techniques of neutralisation because they know that their actions are deviant, that they do share the value consensus of the rest of society and wish to “neutralise” their transgression as soon as possible. Thus they try to explain their deviant actions in such a way as to return quickly to being a normal, compliant member of society.  They will deny responsibility, deny injury, appeal to higher loyalties, etc.  However, critics suggest this is just people making excuses to try and get away with their crimes.  It is not that they share mainstream values but that they are aware that they have behaved in a deviant way and wish to avoid punishment by appealing for mitigation.</p><p>Techniques of neutralization are a theoretical series of methods by which those who commit illegitimate acts temporarily neutralize certain values within themselves which would normally prohibit them from carrying out such acts, such as morality, obligation to abide by the law, and so on. In simpler terms, it is a psychological method for people to turn off inner protests when they do, or are about to do something they themselves perceive as wrong.</p><p>The idea of such techniques was first postulated by David Matza (born May 1, 1930) and Gresham Sykes (born 1922) during their work on Edwin Sutherland’s Differential Association in the 1950s. While Matza and Sykes were at the time working on juvenile delinquency, they theorised that the same techniques could be found throughout society and published their ideas in Delinquency and Drift 1964.</p><p>Techniques of neutralization do just this by providing simple and powerful rationales for why we violate society’s norms, and we use them to explain to ourselves and others why it was “okay” that we do wrong. Matza and Sykes identified five separate techniques of neutralization:</p><blockquote><p>1) <em>Denial of responsibility</em>. We acknowledge doing the behavior considered wrong, but we claim that we had no choice—that we had to do or we were forced to do so.</p><p>2) <em>Denial of injury</em>. We acknowledge doing the wrong action, but we claim that no one was harmed by what we did, so it really shouldn’t be a problem.</p><p>3) <em>Blaming the victim</em>. We acknowledge that people were hurt by our actions, but we claim that though we did the action, it was really the victim’s fault—they brought about or otherwise deserved our behavior.</p><p>4) <em>Condemn the condemners</em>. We abdicate all responsibility for our behavior, and instead we point to the people condemning us. They are the problem, not us. What they have done wrong excuses our behavior.</p><p>5) <em>Appealing to a higher loyalty</em>. We claim that while we violated some social norms, we’re actually adhering to other norms and loyalties, and these higher principles justify our behavior.</p></blockquote><p>It’s pretty straightforward to illustrate these techniques using everyday wrongdoing. Suppose that you cheat on a test. You could deny responsibility. Rather than redefine yourself as a cheater, you might decide that you really had no choice—you just have to graduate this semester.</p><p>Matza and Sykes’ theory states that people are always aware of their moral obligation to abide by the law, and that they have the same moral obligation within themselves to avoid illegitimate acts. Thus, they reasoned, when a person did commit illegitimate acts, they must employ some sort of mechanism to silence the urge to follow these moral obligations.</p><p>This theory rejects other theories which suggested that groups containing delinquents have set up their own permanent moral code which completely replaces moral obligations. Thus, Matza and Sykes were able to explain how offenders ‘drift’ from illegitimate to legitimate lifestyles repeatedly, as they retain the moral code rather than wipe it clean to be replaced by a more illegitimate one as previous theories suggested.</p><p>Further research in the theory has produced inconclusive results. Offenders have been found both with a solid belief in their moral obligations, and without. Travis Hirschi, a social bond theorist, also raised the question as to whether the offender develops these techniques to neutralise their qualms regarding offending before or after they actually commit the offence.</p><p>Neutralization Theory was introduced by Sykes and Matza in 1957, facing the then prevailing criminological wisdom that offenders engage in crime because they adhere to an oppositional subcultural rule set that values law breaking and violence, they rejected this perspective. Subsequent research revealed that the original formulation of the Sykes and Matza’s theory explains only the behavior of “conventionally attached individuals” not those of “nonconventionally oriented individuals” such as “criminally embedded street offenders”. Professor Volkan Topalli, at Georgia State University, in his article The Seductive Nature of Autotelic Crime: How Neutralization Theory Serves as a Boundary Condition for Understanding Hardcore Street Offending, explains that for those groups “guilt is not an issue at all because their crimes are not only considered acceptable, but attractive and desirable”.</p></div></div>

9009	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">TEENAGE VIOLENT CRIME</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><div><p>What do teenagers do after school? Research states that “1 in 5 children in the United States are unsupervised after school”. This leads to teen violence. Teen violence are when children get out of school and join a group of gang and start committing crimes, go in the internet and bully other students. Lastly, teen violence are still going on because of the ways teens are acting, the way they are because of the videogames and the kinds of music teens are listening to. Teen violence are in every school and place that contains teen in it. Those teens that are doing the violence has been abused or bullied before. Teen violence has been passed through generations it gets pass on each year to young adult, the causes of teen violence in the city of Boston is that teen violence is caused because of the ways the parents treat them violence teens. This shows that we need more afterschool program in the United States to keep children engaged and productive. Children in quality afterschool programs are more likely to come to school, stay in school, hand in their work, and get better grades. After school programs are particularly well positioned to make a difference in a student’s life to help them be successful. Students who attends an after school program have a higher chance of going the college and have a career than students who does not attend an afterschool program.</p><p>The problem is that there is a lot of teen violence happening lately. Over the last <a id="_cmntref1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>couple [1]years teen violence has been a problem that is affecting everyone in the city of Boston[2]. Teen [3]violence also affect a lot of things like lowering the budget of the city, making streets unsafe, harassing and bullying other citizen, and sadly the increase in the number of teen who lose their life. According to recent studies about teen violence, 12% of students who attended high school reported having a weapon, and about 3% were carrying a gun. Also 20% of students reported participating in a physical fight, 7% of teens were reported to participate in gang activities. When it comes to bullying, 17% of students said that they had been a victim of bullying and 14% said that they been a victim of cyberbullying <sup>[1]</sup>. The city of Boston contains 25% of the violence in all of Massachusetts <sup>[2]</sup>. It is not easy for a teen to focus and be positive know that 64% of recovered guns are seized from people who own them illegally<sup>[3]</sup>. Teen Violence has a pervasive effect on all members of the society, from the teens themselves to adults that pay higher taxes to address the issue.</p><p>Students that do not go to an after school program are most likely to become involved in teen crime. These students that are unsupervised after school are 49% more likely to use drugs and 37% more likely to become a teen parent than kids that attend some after school programs for 1-4 hours each week. <strong>(add footnote)</strong> Another example of the impact of after school programs is that students that attend an after school program are less likely to be suspended from school for violence, and students already in the juvenile court system that attended after school programs were less likely to go back to court for any reason, especially for violence. Lastly, students in afterschool programs were less likely to become a first time offender of violence in the community than other students not in an afterschool program that had not already committed any crime.<strong>(Add Footnote)</strong></p><p>Twoafter school programs have had large success in preventing crime. When an after school program was created in 12 California neighborhoods, teen crime decreased significantly. Vandalism decreased by two-thirds, violent acts and carrying a concealed gun decreased by more than half, and the number of arrests made by the police decreased by half <strong>(add footnote #1). </strong>Baltimore also made an after school program through the police department. Once it was created, juvenile crime dropped by 10% and the risk of children and teens as victi,s of crime was cut in half <strong>(add footnote #1).</strong> Lastly, the crime rate decreased by 75% in a housing project when an after school program was created, but crime increased in a similar housing project when there was no after school program <strong>(add footnote #2).</strong></p><p>After school program have existed for many years. “After- school programs <a id="_cmntref4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>first [4]emerged in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, in the form of small, idiosyncratic ” boys’ clubs”, often no more than a storefront or room in a church or other local building”(The context for the emergence of the after school program by Robert Halpern).The clubs evolved to provide recreation and learning activities to children. In addition the supply of after school programs is not as high as the demand for them.”Twice as many elementary and middle school parents want afterschool programs as are currently available”(National Opinion Research Center).</p><p>What makes this problem severe is that the lack of afterschool programs allows students to drop out, commit crimes and become teen parents. “The hours between 3 and 6 p.m. are the peak hours for juvenile crime and experimentation with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and sex”(Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, 2003). This is the time when students are leaving school and feel like they are on their own.</p><p>In recent years, more children have been attending after school programs. Their families are in favor of their positive benefits. In 2004, 6.5 million children participated in after school programs, and this value increased to 8.4 million in 2009 and 10.2 million today <strong>(add footnote #3)</strong>. Parents who have kids who attend an after school program have been increasingly satisfied with the programs. Over time they have increased their satisfaction in quality of care, homework assistance, workforce skills development, variety of activities, and the knowledged staff <strong>(footnote #3).</strong></p><p>Juvenile crime rates have decreased since the 1980s, so the effectiveness of afterschool programs is seen in many ways. In recent years (2008-2012), the teen crime rate has decreased. Murder decreased by 42%, rape decreased 24%, robbery decreased by 39%, and aggravated assault decreased by 35% as well in the 4 year period <strong>(add footnote #4)</strong>. For the 6th consecutive year after 2006, the youth violent crime rate has decreased dramatically in the US (<strong>footnote #4)</strong>. The prevalence of crime in males and females ages 10-17 has decreased in the last 4 years. It has also decreased for all races- whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians. Between 2003-2012, violent crime for Asian youth has decreased by 44%, 41% for American Indians, 39% for whites, and 23% for blacks (<strong>add footnote #4)</strong>.The components of violent crime- murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault- have fallen to record lows over the period of 2008-2012.(<strong>add footnote #4)</strong></p><p>Youth property crime has decreased significantly coming up to 2012. In 2012, the property crime rates were at its lowest levels since 1980. In the same 4 year period described earlier, youth were arrested 36% less for burglary, 30% less for larceny-theft, 47% for motor vehicle theft, and 33% less for arson (<strong>footnote</strong>).The prevalence of property crime has decreased for both genders over the period of 2008-2012. The prevalence has also decreased for all<a id="_cmntref5" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a> races, [5]too- whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians.</p><p><strong>“Students who spend no time in extracurricular activities, such as those offered in after-school programs, are 49 percent more likely to have used drugs and 37 percent more likely to become teen parents than are those students who spend one to four hours per week in extracurricular activities”(National Youth Violence Prevention Resource Center).</strong></p><p><strong>Youths who went to a juvenile detention facility were significantly less likely to be suspended from school compared to kids who did not participate in the program. Teens who were a part of the juvenile justice system were significantly less likely to fall back into committing crimes. Teens that had no experience were less likely to commit a first offense. “A study of afterschool programs conducted by the California Juvenile Crime Prevention Demonstration Project in 12 high-risk California communities found that, the rate of crime and delinquency went down after they started the program. Vandalism and stealing dropped by two-thirds, violent acts and carrying a concealed weapon fell by more than half, and arrests and being picked up by the police were cut in half”.</strong></p><p>In the three years after Baltimore’s Police Department opened a Police Activities League (PAL) afterschool program in one high-crime neighborhood, juvenile crime in the neighborhood dropped nearly 10 percent, and the risk of children and teens becoming crime victims was cut nearly in half. While juvenile victimization rates were coming down for all Baltimore juveniles, the rate in the area served by the PAL program came down nearly three times as fast as it did for the city as a whole.x</p><p>Paulo Barros is the person who run the program. All the decisions in implementing the proposed program is made by the director Paulo Barros, catholic charities board, the president of the CEO and vice president of the CEO. It costs the company 1.3 millions of dollars to run yearly. Success are measured based on how many students go the college. It is also measured by the amount of gang involved in the environment and arrests, and how many students gets a job. Also that is where many of Cape Verdean students learn English. This program has been run since 2001. It use to be a middle school K1-8. The program use to run cafeteria in the basement that had nothing to do with school. Throughout the year the program became bigger and bigger and once the school shut down because of the archdiocese sex scandal. Then the teen center took over the building. Saint Peter encourage students to stay in school. Students who attends to Saint Peter are more likely to get good grades and perfect attendance. Saint Peter prevent teens from doing drugs or commit crimes. They don’t serve elementary students due to the lack of funding. Not only that but Saint Peter is not very diverse — majority of Cape Verdeans that goes there. The key groups who support this program are the mayor menino and his family. He backed up our mission statements and wanted a safe community for Bowdoin and Geneva area. The mission that he supported was to provide education, enrichment, leadership development and recreational activities to the adolescents of the Mid- Dorchester corridor.</p><p><strong>Second Alternative: Mattapan Teen Center</strong></p><p>The program is run by the director Ronald Carroll. In 2008 Bain &amp; Company donated to complete a 100 million dollars comprehensive campaign, which calls for investment in innovation and impact to double the number of youth served at the point. It costs 20,686,041 for all operating expensive. Boys and Girls club is successful by teaching young people the skills they need to succeed in life. This can be measured easily by comparing the ratio of students who attends to an after school program to who doesn’t and see who’s more likely to be successful in life. 97% are expected to graduate high school. It has been run since 1893. First club was found in Charlestown in 1893. The Boston foundation helped put the “girls” in the Boys and Girls clubs by providing a $300,000, for three years grant to reach out to “special categories of youth who lack opportunities for appealing programs. In 1981, the club formally changed its name to Boy and Girls clubs of Boston and national organization followed in 1990. Boys and Girls Club help kids stay in school and improve their academic success. It is open daily, after school and on weekends when kids have time and wants to be productive. It helps kids graduate from high school not only that but it also save lives. Boys and Girls club are located in disadvantaged community areas. Macs- generous support for BGCA’s mission and our local Clubs through funds raised during the annual “Thanks for Sharing” campaign helped to create great futures for America’s young people. Ross Stores- helped Clubs provide homework assistance to more than 12,000 youth at 90 Clubs through its support of Power Hour. ConocoPhillips- supported BGCA’s dropout prevention program,Best Buy Children’s Foundation. The mission statement is to help young people, specially those who need us most, build strong character and realize their full potential as responsible citizens and leaders. The organization does this by providing a safe haven filled with hope and opportunity, ongoing relationship with caring adults and life-enhancing programs.</p><p><strong>Alternative 3: Holland School</strong></p><p>The program is run by Hillary casson. That legislation that this program supports is the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care because the Programs are licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care and Turnaround plan. The Chester commissioner’s team and Scoot given, the chief executive officer are in charge of the day to day management of the school. And will work directly to implement the holland plan. The Mission of this program is that all students acquire the knowledge, skills, and strength of character necessary to succeed on the path to college and to achieve their full potential. Therefore it is measure of how many students are moving on to the next grade and their growth from the time they start and end. 2013, Up receives a new schools venture fund U.S education reform organization of the year award. UpHolland is a elementary school and there is an after school programs that include homework support and tutoring. Upholland after school supports all students with extra help including students with disabilities and English language learners. They only serve K1- 5th grader. The key groups who support this after school program is the College Bound Dorchester. The college Bound Dorchester provides students with a range of activities including homework assistance, writing, visual and performing arts, science exploration, physical education and field trips. During the last year, 98% of Out of School Time students were promoted to the next grade level on time. Out of School Time programs serve children ages 6 to 12 years between the hours of 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm during the academic year.</p></div><div id="_ftn1"><p><sup>[1]</sup> ” Youth Violence Prevention Through Positives Youth Development” <em>Mass. gov</em> ,2013.

Bachelor in Business Administration or BBA is a professional degree. BBA students have to do an internship program as a practical orientation to the workplace where he/she can merge the theoretical knowledge with practical work experience. I have been pursuing my internship program in the Customer Care Department under the Core Marketing Division of AKTEL Bangladesh (Telecom Malaysia International Bangladesh). Its corporate office is located in ‘Silver Tower’ Gulshan-1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. Rationale of the Report:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The main objective of this study is to prepare an Internship report on the specified topic working within an organization and implementing the knowledge that has been gathered during the Internship Program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. Objectives of the Report:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The specific objectives of this report are as follows:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>To analyze the current scenario of our Telecom Industry.</li><li>To understand the operation and current condition of AKTEL.</li><li>To find out the current arrangements of AKTEL regarding corporate services.</li><li>To perceive the entire activities they performed to furnish the corporate services providing complete satisfaction to the corporate clients</li><li>To determine the Consumer Preference s Level of AKTEL regarding corporate package</li><li>To determine the level of negotiation and customization demanded by the customer</li><li>To describe the Internship Activities and experiences gathered while working with the AKTEL corporate client project.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.2 Origin of the Report</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Each professional degree needs practical knowledge of the respective field of discipline to be fruitful. Our BBA program also has an Internship Program, relating to the exchange of theoretical knowledge into the real life. This report entitled <b>“Appraisal of Customer Services to the corporate client provided by AKTEL”.</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the Internship Program, I was under supervision and guidance of<b>,</b> Saadia Shabnam lecturer, department of Business administration, East West University.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And I had to submit my internship report to <b>Mr Tanvir Rahman </b>, Deputy Manager, Customer Service Division, Silver tower Branch , TM International Bangladesh Ltd (AKTEL). He was always careful about my performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, during the attachment in AKTEL, I was under the supervision and guidance of <b>Mr. Abdullah Al Mahbub , Senior</b> Executive, Customer Service Division, Silver Tower Branch, TM International Bangladesh Ltd (AKTEL).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.3 Methodology:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The report tried to evaluate Customer Services to the corporate client provided by AKTEL”Why the clients use this connection. Before going in to the deep study, conceptual structure visualized under which the whole study was conducted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In preparing this report about the Customer Services to the corporate client provided by <b>AKTEL</b>” is a difficult and complicated task and no single method is appropriate for conducting the exploratory research. For this reason, a number of procedures have been followed to prepare a meaningful report. The methodology of the task can be depicted as follows. Primary data, Secondary data collection, Expert surveys.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sources of Data</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This study covered two types of data, which are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a. Primary data b. Secondary data</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. Primary Data: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Primary data has been collected through a structured questionnaire, constructed specially for this report.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To collect the primary data, the following steps have been followed to obtain the research objective:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li># Data collected from web site.</li><li># Taking interviews of subscribers over Phone.</li><li># Taking face-to-face interviews of subscribers.</li><li># Interview of key informant that is the senior official of AKTEL in order to collect</li><li>Information about the services.</li><li># Interview of industry expert, regarding the corporate clientele issue.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. Secondary Data:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Going through different documents and papers, news letter (for internal purpose only), developed by the company personnel, different books, journals, newspapers, brochures, website also was used to collect the secondary data. Huge number of data was collected from the Corporate sales division of AKTEL ,</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>* Collection Procedure of Data:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Personal interview technique was the primary tool used in collecting information. Interview with the Customer have done. Managers and officers of AKTEL from different divisions were the main sources of secondary data. The corporate sales executive, account manager and assistant manager of corporate sales division provide me proper information and assistance about the issue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>* Analysis of Data:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, I performed qualitative research here. A profile of corporate client is made and some hypothesis were made to analyze the concerning issues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sampling Plan and Sample Size: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>** Study Population:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first step of the sampling design is to define the study population. Due to time restriction and other limitations, the survey will only focus on the officials of the corporate sales department of AKTEL, and some industry expert’s opinion. The sample area has been selected on the basis of organization’s interest and on the basis of availability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>** Sampling Frame:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As there is no concrete list or number Corporate Client, it is tough to perform a structured sampling frame. The sample frame is random selection. The researcher has to take personal depth interview to meet up own requirement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>** Sampling Method:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">To investigate the issue customer service towards the corporate client, Non-probability Sampling Procedure has been used. The sampling unit was selected through Convenience Sampling: where the selection of the sampling unit is left primarily on the interviewer. The reason behind choosing Convenience Sampling is many but here most importantly, there is no appropriate structure or framework that can aid to select the sample. Farther, these procedures are both time saving and inexpensive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>** Data Gathering Method:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Basically this research paper is based on qualitative research, which formulated through different Kinds interview on respective personnel</p><p style="text-align: justify;">.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>** Data Collection Method:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The data has been collected through questionnaire survey. When I got the uneducated respondent, then as the interviewer I fill up the questionnaire based on the respondent answer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>** Profile and Analysis Procedure:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A profile of typical corporate client of AKTEL has been made on the basis of collected information and some hypothesis are constructed for the purpose of analysis</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.4 Limitations of this Report:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The study is not free from some practical limitations. Following limitations I have to face during the study and the time of working and data collection:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Time is the main limitation for my study. Due to lack of sufficient time, I was not able to do survey properly among all of the potential sample size. That’s why the findings may not be fully but partially true. If I had more time I could go for more descriptive research and discover more accurate result. Workload during the Internship Program at the work place was also a barrier to prepare this report. The data collection was full of complexities because relevant data sources were hard to find out. There are so many obstacles because; the service provider company is not willing to disclose their offerings and flexibilities towards the general people. Due to lack of practical experience, some errors might be occurred during the study. In spite of the maximum efforts was taken to avoid the mistakes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>* Time Line for the Research: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Internship Program has been conducted in the following time 7<sup>th</sup> February 2008-30<sup>th</sup> April, 2008. Preparation of literature review, formulating research objective, conducting introductory chapter including detailed context of the study as well as development of research design was done in the period of internship.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter – 1</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.5 Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile phone means a device that transmits voice or data, using radio waves to communicate with radio antennas placed within adjacent geographic areas called cells. It is a very common source of communication in these days. Most of the people are using mobile phone in the city and the urban areas. Telecommunication linked with satellites. It brings about revolutionary changes in communication. New STD (Standard) and ISD (International System for Dialog) facilities have made communication an instantaneous process. The world appears to have contracted or been squeezed into a small room in which, given certain facilities, it is possible to communicate with anyone in any part of the world.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.6</b> <b>Background of the Telecommunication Industry in Bangladesh</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this era of globalization, communication has become the most significant factor. For this, telecom industry is playing the major role to change the lives of the people and their business. In a densely populated country like Bangladesh, telecommunication can play a vital role to boost the economy and social level of people. This sector is poised for rapid growth in the coming years. Moreover, the efficiency of other businesses has already increased because mobile phone has become easily available in these days due to the government’s decision of deregulating the telecommunications sector, which had been a state monopoly until the late 1980s. Privatization of the telecommunication sector began in 1989, when Sheba and BRTA were awarded 25-year licenses to install and operate fixed-wire lines and wireless services in rural areas. The same year, Pacific Telecom Bangladesh got the Government’s permission to launch the country’s fire cellular phone and paging service sold under brand name CityCell in collaboration with a Hong Kong based company. The company targeted only the higher class of the society. During that time price of mobile was above Tk 50,000/. Naturally, the growth of the industry was very slow. CityCell had a virtual monopoly until 1996, when the government gave licenses to three more companies to operate cell phones in Bangladesh. So the government decided to bring more companies in the market and break the monopoly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After a careful evaluation, Bangladesh government decided to provide three licenses to GrameenPhone, TMIB (AKTEL), and Sheba Telecom (today’s BanglaLink). CityCell is using the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) technology. GrameenPhone, AKTEL, and BanglaLink are using GSM technology. GSM is the most popular mobile telecommunication technology in the world. About 60% of the cell phone users of the world use GSM technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These three new companies entered the market, not only helped to cut back the over-dependence on BTTB’s fixed-line system, but also made mobile phones cheaper and easier to get. A definite development has been observed in the business market with comparatively high expectations. Customer maturity and anticipation regarding technology has increased over time. Rumors regarding new entrants have groomed expectations in the market. Consequently, people are expecting cheaper handsets with lowered airtime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the recent entrances of private fixed land phone companies have increased the concern of the cell phone companies. New companies like RanksTel, OneTel, Bay Phone and Bijoy Phone have kicked off their operations in different districts in Southeast, Northeast and Northwest regions of Bangladesh. In near future, this new segment might be a creeping threat for the existing players inside the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.6.1 Reforms in Telecommunication Sector of Bangladesh</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most countries have already undergone fundamental telecom sector reform. Bangladesh is absolutely one of the last that bring up the rear to learn from others’ lessons. However, it is not evident that Bangladesh’s reform model is based on a clearly articulated and supported strategy. Most countries have gradually transitioned from monopoly provision of services by state-owned incumbent to competitive market structure where several companies fight to capture and keep customers. The key is to time the introduction of competition in a way that aligns with the growth, maturity and advancement of the telecom infrastructure and service provision. By licensing six mobile and 19 PSTN operators, Bangladesh has rapidly leapt from closed monopoly to open market in all but a bold moves granted, there is a challenge. In advanced market there is usually room for plenty of competition due to market size and maturity. Bangladesh’s $2 billion revenue market still requires substantial amounts of infrastructure build-out especially for fixed and data services. In this context, the opportunity rapidly crumbles into much smaller prizes when split between half a dozen hungry mobile operators and then all of 19 fixed ones. In Germany, which is a country with an advanced telecom infrastructure and sophisticated market and a GDP of $2.5 trillion, the government issued six mobile operator licenses to offer next-generation “3G” services in 2001. After post-licensing consolidation only four of them survive today.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.6.2 Telecom Industry in SAARC countries</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh has one of the lowest tele density and the lowest telephone penetration rates in the world and even in the South Asia. According to the ITU (International Telecommunication) report, the telecommunication revenue as a percentage of the GDP is also low in Bangladesh compared to other regional countries. Among the SAARC countries’ per 100 inhabitants, Maldives has the highest tele density while Bangladesh has the lowest</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>Country</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>Bangladesh</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>India</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>Pakistan</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>Nepal</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>Bhutan</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>Maldives</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom"><b>Sri Lanka</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"><b>Number of Telephone per 100 Inhabitants</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap"><b>0.79</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap"><b>4.01</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap"><b>2.9</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap"><b>1.34</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap"><b>2.03</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap"><b>16.92</b></td><td nowrap="nowrap"><b>8.1</b></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Figure: Number of telephone per 100 inhabitants in SAARC countries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.6.3 Market Growth of Telecom Industry </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the initial stage of the mobile telecom industry because of high startup cost and high tariff there was only a few numbers of subscribers. In 1997, there were approximately 2000 mobile subscribers around the country with a low market penetration rate (0.02%). At present, the number of mobile subscribers in the country is approximately 10 million. Currently Bangladesh has five operators as Teletalk a sister concern of BTTB has entered in the market recently. Though Teletalk targeted to cover 0.25 million subscribers by first six months of launch and 1 million by 2006, in reality only 80,000 customers base has been created in first 5 months. In addition, Teletalk has offered lower rate with PSTN connection all over the country. The total number of districts covered in mobile industry has been increased to 61 in 2005 from 1 in 1997. The total telecom growth has increased to 55% in 2004 from 19% in 1998. Initially, mobile growth rate was too high which was 178% in 1998 and it came to 51% in the year 2005. So we can say that the industry is not going to its maturity stage. From the comparison of different operators’ subscriber base, it can be said that still GrameenPhone is leading the way with a sharp distance. Though Citycell is the first mobile operator in Bangladesh, it is not doing its business s good. BanglaLink has done an excellent breakthrough as it has increased its subscriber base from 3000 (ex-Sheba) in 1998 to almost 2 million in this year 2006. On the other hand, AKTEL is growing its subscribers faster than CityCell, which is from 3000 in 1997 to about 3.8 million in this year 2006.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As the number of companies inside the telecom industry is increasing, the penetration level is getting high. Consequently, the penetration in the mobile industry in 2005 is 4.89%. The growth of mobile industry has drastically changed in 2005-2006 because of the Govt. tax imposed on each SIM card purchase. However, the telecom industry growth is almost same as in 2004 since new fixed land phone companies have started their operations.</p><table align="left" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td><td valign="top"><b>1997</b></td><td valign="top"><b>1998</b></td><td valign="top"><b>1999</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2000</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2001</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2002</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2003</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2004</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2005</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Market Penetration</b></td><td valign="top"><b>0.02%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>0.05%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>0.1%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>0.21%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>0.53%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>0.87%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>1.88%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>3.13%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>4.89%</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>District Coverage</b></td><td valign="top"><b>1</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2</b></td><td valign="top"><b>26</b></td><td valign="top"><b>36</b></td><td valign="top"><b>40</b></td><td valign="top"><b>49</b></td><td valign="top"><b>59</b></td><td valign="top"><b>61</b></td><td valign="top"><b>61</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Telecom Growth Rate</b></td><td valign="top"><b>–</b></td><td valign="top"><b>19%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>17%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>34%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>66%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>42%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>40%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>55%</b></td><td valign="top"><b>52%</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan="10"><strong>SUBSCRIBERS BASE</strong></td></tr><tr><td><b>GrameenPhone</b></td><td><b>18,000</b></td><td><b>30,000</b></td><td><b>60,000</b></td><td><b>191,690</b></td><td><b>471,371</b></td><td><b>775,310</b></td><td><b>1,878,000</b></td><td><b>2,424,177</b></td><td valign="top"><b>40,00,000</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>CityCell</b></td><td><b>2,000</b></td><td><b>19,000</b></td><td><b>26,200</b></td><td><b>33,500</b></td><td><b>100,000</b></td><td><b>160,000</b></td><td><b>2,250,000</b></td><td><b>370,000</b></td><td valign="top"><b>4,00,000</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>AKTel</b></td><td><b>3,000</b></td><td><b>12,000</b></td><td><b>28,500</b></td><td><b>34,200</b></td><td><b>96,000</b></td><td><b>150,000</b></td><td><b>300,000</b></td><td><b>1,000,000</b></td><td valign="top"><b>2,500,000</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>BanglaLink (ex-Sheba)</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>3,000</b></td><td><b>11,000</b></td><td><b>19,000</b></td><td><b>27,000</b></td><td><b>60,000</b></td><td><b>70,000</b></td><td><b>100,000</b></td><td valign="top"><b>5,00,000</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>TeleTalk</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td><b>–</b></td><td valign="top"><b>80,000</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Figure: Growth of Telecom Industry 1997-2006</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.7 Subscriber Base of Mobile Operators of our Country</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this competitive market, all the companies are adopting different policies to draw the customers towards then offering so many varieties of products &amp; services. Currently, GrameenPhone is the market leader with almost 9 million subscriber’s base till August 2006. AKTEL is holding their position in the second place and trying hard to become the market leader within the year 2008. BanglaLink with their aggressive marketing strategy is creating chaos in the market through price war. TeleTalk &amp; CityCell are struggling in the market to hold their positions, as both the companies need to concentrate on their product development and marketing research activities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Figure: Subscriber Base of All the Mobile Companies Currently Operating in the Market</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i> Figure: Market Share of the Companies Currently Operating in the Market</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.8 Product Life Cycle</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If we point the tentative picture of the mobile phone and land phone, then we will get the product life cycle where we can clearly find out that land phone has already passed its growth stage, as it is not growing rapidly. But in case of mobile phone we can find out that it is in the growth stage as the revenue generated from this product is increasing and still has the potentiality to be boosted up and contribute to the telecommunication sector.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the market strategies segment the product strategy is on the offer product extensions and on service orientation. More and more offers of value added service and added features are included in the package. The pricing strategy is to penetrate the market. So they are all more or less following the penetration pricing strategy. In distribution strategy the industry is the building on intensive distribution. More and more emphasis is given on gaining the market. So distributing the product to the far corners of the country has become a priority. In case advertising &amp; promotional strategy the companies are all in aggressive advertising policy. Using all the possible media uses to increase the market share &amp; reaching potential customers in mass market. Lastly in sales promotion the companies are on a rampage. They are offering enormous amount of services with the same package &amp; low cost rate with different events all round the year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.9 Situational Analysis</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Situation analysis is the broader activity of understanding the changing external environment that may impact the organization. It is one of the most important parts of the environmental scanning to alert the decision makers to potentially significant external changes before they crystallize. Consequently, decision makers have sufficient lead-time to react to the change.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Political Factors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladesh, there are a few companies that are not affected by political situation as well as by the government policies. That’s why marketing strategy is deeply affected by political perspectives. The government of Bangladesh has given mobile sector ample amount of freedom to do business. There were some stiff regulations that hindered the possible entry in the mid 90’s but as technology entered the new millennia, government freed the way for companies to enter the market. Government’s stability affects the operators and new companies in taking investing activities whether government will be liberal or strict in transferring profit from the country. Moreover, Monitory policy affects the mobile operators in terms of currency valuation that is devaluation leads them to increase in dollar value cost of operating activities. This also affects their increase in cost of importing instruments and technical devices. Political support for a particular company can threaten other companies in various ways. Government’s support can increase the growth of this industry. During the last fiscal year, when government imposed Tk 900 tax on the SIM card, it severely hampered the growth of the industry. Market research revealed that the new connection selling has decreased 55% from May’06 to July’06.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Economic Factors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Economic trends can also affect the growth of the mobile phone user. Usually economic environment is analyzed with reference to the following key economic factors: employment, CPI, personal income, real GNP etc. The stable GDP from the year 1992 to 2006 has increased mobile phone user from 0 to 8 million. Increase in the employment, saving rate and purchasing power as well as the spending capacity acted as a catalyst for this amazing increase in the number of mobile phone users. Heavy growth of small families is increasing so there is bright prospect that this user segment will continue to rise like the past. However, the increasing inflation rate is badly hampering the amount of discretionary income as the price of different consumer products is increasing in an alarming rate. People are becoming more conscious about their living standard. This squeezing of the income amount may affect the growth of the industry. Still the growth has been tremendous over the last few years particularly in the year 2006 when BanglaLink entered the market. Meanwhile, GrameenPhone reached an astonishing 85 lakhs customer base this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Social Factors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ultimate test of a business is its social relevance. An important aspect of the social environment concerns the values consumers’ hold. Values mainly revolve around a number of fundamental concerns regarding time, environment, personal finance, diversity etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Orientation towards time</i>: Convenience is a critical source of differential advantage, particularly in the service sector. Youth are making or influencing more household decisions. Moreover as the population ages time pressures become more widespread and acute. The interest to acquire and use new technology has been a big factor. Everybody wants to be connected with each other &amp; having a mobile connection has become a social status for some part of the population.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Diversity of Lifestyle</i>: People from various age and segment have a positive response to have a mobile phone if he has the ability to have it. People’s perception toward mobile phone has changed from the past. Today mobile phones have given a diversified lifestyle to the society. The diversification &amp; integration and doing multi tasking has become more easy day-by-day. The connections in the rural areas have given a touch of focusing the rural business with the business of that of the capital.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Technological Factors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Technological factors include the use of technology in doing business. Up to date use of technology helps to acquire the economies of scale for the company and cost savings. It also gives them the opportunity to expand in the future. In recent times, Bangladesh has connected to the fiber optic. This information super high way can dramatically change the entire nation in creating new business opportunity. If there is an increase in the business activity, there will be more employment. Therefore, more people who will have the ability to have a mobile phone. Again large business activity will also need more communication to run business transaction. This will also increase the need of mobile phone. Considering other technological sectors, people are being more attached with the technology. This attitude of tying up with technology is showing increase the selling of computer, increase in the Internet user, and increase in the number of cyber café, increase in the land phone user and many more. Changes and positive response will lead to further increase in the need and growth of mobile phone users. Currently the mobile phone companies of our country are not exactly using the state of the art of technology. Although different multinational companies like Siemens, Nokia &amp; Sony Ericsson are helping these companies but they need to be updated more.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.10. Intensity of Competition</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is a matter of fact that to survive in an industry, grow, sustain in competition and to differentiate with others operating in the same industry, a company must understand the dynamics of the industry competition among firms. Michael Porter has developed a framework, named as <i>“PORTER’S FIVE FORCES MODEL”</i> with which we can analyze the industry environment to identify the threats &amp; opportunities of the firm. The model is based on five forces that shape competition within an industry, i.e. –</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Risk of Entry by Potential Competitors:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Potential Entrants are companies that are not currently competing an industry but have the capability to do so if they choose. It is a distinct fact that the risk of entry by potential competitors is a function of height of Barriers to Entry. A new entrant in telecommunication industry will have to face situations with the disadvantage because it is impossible to have economies of scale and the entrant will not have any cost advantage. For a new entrant the brand identity depends on whether the company is a multinational or a local company. If it is a multinational company, then and only then it will have some sort of brand identity. For a new entrant, access to distribution is limited. Switching costs for a new entrant is high. On top of that, capital requirement for a new company is high because system formulation and network establishment.Also there are some Government policieslike the introduction of new tax on every purchase of a new connection. In the following we will discuss these matters in details:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Barriers to Entry have three main sources, i.e. – brand loyalty, absolute cost advantages &amp; economies of scale.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>i. Brand Loyalty:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Large companies enjoy a brand loyalty in the market through its huge customer base, customer retention ratio, reputation, high product quality, and after sales service. There are large established companies in telecommunication sector, like GrameenPhone, BanglaLink, CityCell, and TeleTalk who have brand loyal customers &amp; enjoy a competitive position in the market. So whatever product/service they come up in the future they can easily capture market share. This makes it difficult for new entrants to fight with these established brands for gaining market share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>ii. Absolute Cost Advantage:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Absolute Cost Advantage arise from following sources; i.e. – product diversification, pricing strategy etc, they represent lower risk than entrants. In mobile telecommunication industry companies have long experience in this sector. Some of them have experience in doing business in different parts of the world. Using that experience here &amp; following those successful strategies gives the companies some cost advantages as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>iii. Economies of Scale</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sources of economies of scale are i.e. – discounts on bulk purchases cards, advantages gained by spreading fixed production cost over a large production volume and cost savings associated with spreading marketing/advertising expense over a large output.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In telecommunication industry the companies get 2% – 5% discounts from card making companies because of bulk purchase, can spread fixed cost over huge number of conversions &amp; save advertising costs over their large output.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>iv. Customer Switching Costs</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Switching costs arise when it costs a customer time, energy &amp; money to switch from products offered by established firms to products offered by new entrants. Because of intense competition in the market the switching cost is very low right now. The companies are offering very low connection fee. So there is a tendency of customers using multiple company service at the same time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>v. Government Regulation</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Government regulation summarizes government’s policy towards setting up new industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· The newly imposed tax of Tk 1,200 on every mobile SIM (subscriber identification module) card and connection</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· The government had reduced the mobile handset tariff in fiscal 2004-05 to Tk 1,500 from the previous Tk 4,000</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bargaining Power of Suppliers:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It refers to the ability of suppliers to raise input prices, threat to stop selling products &amp; delay in delivering products. The suppliers are the mobile SIM card providers. They don’t have that much of bargaining power with the company. The reason is, Supplier concentration for telecommunications industry is low in Bangladesh. Moreover, there are very few buyers (only five operators) in Bangladesh as well. Switching costs of buyers are high because the supplier concentration is low. Also the threat of forward integration is moderate. So in other words, we can say that supplier power can dominate the industry operations only to some extent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So the bargaining power of Suppliers depends on the following factors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Supplier Concentration: Low</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Number of Buyers: 5</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Switching Costs: High</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Substitute Raw Materials: Low</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Threat of Forward Integration: Moderate</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bargaining Power of Buyers:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An industry’s buyers are individual customers who consume products, as end users &amp; retailer’s are who buy it for selling to customers. The customers and the dealers are the main buyers in the mobile industry. It gives them more bargaining power over the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So it can be said that buyer concentration in Bangladesh for telecommunication industry is very high because there are 145 million people living in a very small country. On the other hand, the numbers of suppliers are five. Switching cost for the buyers is moderate to high. There are very few Substitute Services available. Also, threat of backward integration is very low. All of these forces make the bargaining power of buyers very low.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So the bargaining power of buyers depends on the following factors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Buyer Concentration: High</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Number of Suppliers: 5</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Switching Costs: Moderate to high</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Substitute Products: Very few in numbers</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <i>Threat of Backward Integration: Low</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Threat of Substitute:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Substitutes are products that of different business that can satisfy similar customer needs. In the telecommunication industry, the close substitute is the BTTB land phones &amp; some other new wireless fixed phones. BTTB land phone connections have been there for the last 30 years and so but the mobile phone connection out numbered them in a couple of years. So they are not a big threat now. The new wireless FIXED phones are relatively new in the market so they are not opposing any direct threat to the mobile sector as well. Moreover these phones are targeting some specific segments of the market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Rivalry Among Competitors:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rivalry refers to the competitive struggle between companies in an industry to gain market share from each other using price, product design, superior product offering, advertising spending, after sales service &amp; support. The intensity of rivalry among companies in an industry is a function of industry competitive structure, demand condition &amp; height of exit barriers in the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>i. Industry Competitive Structure:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It refers to the number &amp; size distribution of companies within that industry. In Bangladesh the mobile phone industry falls under consolidated industry representing a small number of large companies, i.e. –GrameenPhone, AKtel, BanglaLink, CityCell &amp; TeleTalk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>ii. Demand Conditions:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The current demand in the market for connection is very high. On an average every company is launching a new product or extensions every month. Price sensitive customers are really switching connections every time a new package comes out.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>iii. Exit Barriers:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exit Barriers represents investment in fixed asset, high fixed cost, equipment &amp; economic dependence on industry. All the companies entered the market with huge initial investment and strong market commitment strategy. So the exit barrier is very high.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.11 SWOT Analysis of AKTEL</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strengths and weaknesses are the microenvironment factors influencing a business, which are within the organization. Opportunities and threats are the microenvironment factors that influence all the firms in the industry. This is a very important tool for a company in order to determine the present standpoint of the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.11.1 Strengths</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Joint Venture </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTEL is a brand of TM International Bangladesh Ltd., which is a joint venture of A.K. Khan &amp; Co. Limited of Bangladesh and Telecom Malaysia Berhad of Malaysia. A. K. Khan &amp; Co. Ltd. and Telecom Malaysia Berhad comprise 30% and 70% equity capitals respectively in this joint venture. TMIB started its operation in 1997 after receiving the license in 1996 to operate GSM cellular phone services in Bangladesh. This venture has contributed both the companies the advantage of risk diversification. At the same time, Telekom Malaysia Berhad has gained strong local network through A. K. Khan &amp; Co. Ltd., which is a well-established company based in Chittagong.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Foreign Knowledge Resources</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The top-level management of TM International Bangladesh Ltd. by any large, consists of foreign personalities. Most of the departmental heads are from Malaysia, India, Australia, and Sri-Lanka. Because of this mix &amp; match of local and foreign expertise in the company, there is a blend of knowledge. Moreover, the generation of foreign knowledge in the company has enabled the company to compete internationally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Highly Competitive market</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, there are five major players operating in the telecom sector. All the companies have foreign alliance and they are highly competitive except TeleTalk. To keep pace in this extremely aggressive rivalry, AKTEL has adopted an offensive marketing strategy. Operating in such a market and adopting such strategies have given the company an internal competitiveness, which in turn has allowed TMIB to operate in foreign market with giant foreign competitors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Strong Brand Image</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TM International (Bangladesh) Ltd. commenced its journey with the brand “AKTEL” in 1997 as the 2<sup>nd</sup> GSM operator in Bangladesh. Since its inception, AKTEL has established itself into a popular name among the community. Being on of the pioneers, AKTEL has a strong brand image in Bangladesh and people recognize the name instantaneously. This recognition has given the company an added advantage, as TMIB is operating in a very competitive market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Skilled Human Resource</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Because of its attractive incentive packages and strong brand image in the job-market, skilled workforces have grown an interest towards TMIB. This has given the company an extra benefit, as the company can recruit the finest from the pool of employees. Furthermore, TMIB frequently recruits young, enthusiastic, and resourceful employees from reputed academic institutions. It also provides motivation among its employees by offering extra inducements such as: awarding gold medals to best employees of the year, organizing entertainment programs, providing transportation facility etc. These extra services have enhanced employees’ motivation level and loyalty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Non-Political Work Environment</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The work-environment of TMIB is very friendly and co-operative. The practice of internal politics is completely absent and there is an orderly co-ordination among the departments. As most of the employees belong to the same age group, there is a harmonization in the organization.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Collaboration with Diverse Companies</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB has alliance with diverse companies to support its service offerings. For an example, recently the company has launched a club-membership facility for its post-paid subscribers, named “Club Magnate”. To offer this club-membership, TMIB has collaborated with different companies such as Agora, Malaysia Airlines, Hotel Seagull etc. In a similar manner, TMIB has partnerships with Cineplex, BDJobs, Deshimobile, and Fantasy Kingdom etc. These collaborations have contributed the company in cost-efficiency and super service-offerings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Collaboration with Financial Institutions</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from having collaboration with diverse companies, TMIB also has collaboration with a number of financial institutions. For example, TMIB has affiliations with HSBC and Standard Chartered bank for billing and salary purposes. It also has collaboration with EBL and other banks. Because of maintaining an excellent relationship with these financial institutions, TMIB will get the privilege while taking loans or any type of financial services from these institutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Distinctive Service Offers</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB has a well-known reputation of being “The First Being Ever” in the country. It has always tried to bring something new and exceptional in the market. There are countless services, which are brought by TMIB under AKTEL brand. Some of the outstanding services are: E-fill, Pulse offer, GPRS (Mobile Internet), Greeting Messages (Fun Dose), buy-one-get-one offers etc. By providing distinct services, TMIB has achieved the status of “Fast Mover”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Customer Care Base</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB has established several Customer Care Centers in major points of Dhaka city, such as Gulshan-1, Gulshan-2, Dhanmondi, Motijheel, and uttara etc. Moreover, it has set up Customer Care Centers in major districts of the country such as Comilla, Chittagong, Sylhet and Khulna. There are 11 Customer Care Centers in total and these centers have allowed the subscribers to get free services even staying in remote places of the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Affable Corporate Culture</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The corporate culture of TMIB is famous for being friendly and positive. The company has a “Thursday Dress-Code” for the employees. It also assembles money from every employee to have tea-break snacks. There is a pleasing synchronization among the staffs, which has built a positive corporate culture.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[[[[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Societal Marketing</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB regularly takes part in charity functions and is renowned for donating money in different deprived institutions around the country. The company has already donated money, free-books, free-medicines, and free SIM cards in various schools, madrasas and hospitals. It is also involved in societal marketing advertising. Recently the slogan campaign of TMIB supporting the autistic children has attracted huge attention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.11.2 Weaknesses</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Poor Work Delegation Structure</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[[</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The departmental structure of TMIB is not precise and well thought-out. Each department contains several units. However, the units are not separated by well-defined boundaries and it is very difficult to distinguish among them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Employee Insufficiency </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The departments of TMIB do not have sufficient work force to carry on a thorough task. Most of the employees in each unit are loaded with several duties and sometimes it becomes a burden on their shoulders. Lack of employees in each department is an obvious problem of the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>High Fixed Cost</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Telecommunication industry has a high level of fixed costs. TMIB, operating in this industry, also faces such disadvantages. Office rent, network tower maintenance cost, operational cost etc are the fixed costs of the company. These fixed costs do not allow the company to gain the advantage of economies of scale, which is essential for the company to perform well financially. Because of high fixed cost and low economies of scale, the company also has a low reinvestment rate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>High Employee Turnover Rate</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As there are four major players operating in the market, it is apparent that each company will try to draw employees from other companies by offering better incentive-packages. This practice has created a high employee turn over rate in TMIB. Every year, lots of competent workers leave the company to join other companies. This has created a major crisis, as TMIB cannot implement any effective long-term strategy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[[[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Inadequate Network Coverage in Rural Areas</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[[[</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Presently, TMIB has network coverage in 61 districts. However, most of the upazilas of these districts do not have the coverage. Therefore, despite covering 61 main districts of the country, AKTEL users in rural areas do not get the frequency. This has created a disappointment among the subscriber and hence it is a drawback of TMIB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Feeble Recruitment Policy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though TMIB attracts skilled workers from renowned academic institutions all over the country, because of its poor recruitment policy, many undesired employees are hired over desired ones. Sometimes people with objectionable background are hired and sometimes, right people are not hired in right positions. Thus it creates a risk of wasting talents in the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dealer Insufficiency</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB has only 4-5 authorized dealers and one distributor, which is insufficient for a company, covering network in 61 districts. As a result of inadequate number of dealers and distributors, there is high possibility of Gray Marketing. If the SIM cards of TMIB pass on the hands of unauthorized dealers, it would be very difficult for the company to maintain a consistency in price and quality.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Network Limitation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Call drop, congestion, and poor network connectivity with BTTB result in bad image of the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Some Value-Added Services are not successful </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Voice mail service hasn’t been proved as lucrative due to language barrier, lack of promotions, lack of know-how about interactive services and also because people are reluctant to speak to a machine. Not only this, usage of short message service is still low due to lack of adequate promotion, lack of knowledge of English and unawareness of handset configuration and un-ergonomic nature of keypad.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Commercial Ads are not too creative</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The commercial ads of AKTEL are not that much appealing its prospective customers compare to its competitors. Valuable features are not focused in its Ad. AKTEL doesn’t show its competitive advantages through its ads whereas its competitors such as BanglaLink or CityCell have done it effectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.11.3 Opportunities</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Incompetent Public Sector</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Public sector in Bangladesh is not capable of meeting the market demand of prospective phone users. Moreover, the lengthy and bureaucratic process of public offices has discouraged people to use T&amp;T and public mobile phone (TeleTalk). For these inconvenience systems, people in our country have adopted private mobile phone services as an alternative. This is a great opportunity for TMIB to grab this huge market of prospective phone users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Upward Moving Population Income</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to World Bank source, the disposable income of people in Bangladesh is increasing every year. In addition, Bangladeshi market has high mobile phone acceptability. Both the factors are fostering the fact that Bangladesh is a potential market for mobile phone companies. Operating in such a market is a lucrative opportunity for TMIB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Business Diversification Opportunity</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">[</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Operating in telecommunication industry has given TMIB with the opportunity of business diversification in related sectors. Having the expertise in telecommunication field for a long time, TMIB can expand its business phone set business, mobile phone battery business etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Easy Entrance to Foreign Market</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB has joint venture with a prominent Malaysian telecom company, Telecom Malaysia Berhad. At the same time, operating in an aggressive market has enabled the company to become very competitive. These attributes have permitted the company to have an easy access to foreign market and compete with foreign rivals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Easy Loan Access</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As discussed before, TMIB has collaboration with a number of financial institutions regarding billing and wage-payment purposes. This has allowed the company to have a good relationship with the institutions. TMIB can take advantage of these collaborations and can have easy access to loans and other financial matters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[[</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Full-fledged GPRS Package</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB has already brought GPRS in Bangladesh. However, the service is in its initial stage. Since no other company has brought a complete GPRS package, TMIB can take this advantage and bring a full-fledged GPRS package. GPRS is a completely new technology in our country and it is obvious that the package will be a hot cake in the market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>New Strategic Alliances</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strategic alliance in telecommunication industry is not a new phenomenon. All the four operators in Bangladesh have strategic alliances with several foreign companies. TMIB can form new alliances with eminent companies of different countries to achieve higher competitiveness and bring more expertise inside the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>[[[</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Network Coverage Expansion</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMIB has already network coverage in 61 districts. However, most of the upazilas and rural areas of these districts are not under the coverage. In this circumstance, to increase the coverage in remote areas, TMIB can utilize its already established towers. Otherwise, they can set up new towers. Establishing new towers will not be a barrier for TMIB, as the company can form collaborations with GrameenPhone or other operators who already have towers in those areas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Huge Need for Telecom Service</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Current market growth of the telecommunication is significant which arises a great opportunity for the cellular phone companies to grow rapidly. The demand of the cell phone is still increasing. Variety services with most lucrative features made this sector more and more attractive day by day. Recent year’s growth reflects the enormous potential for the development to telecommunications and information technology in the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Declining Prices for Handsets</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The prices of the mobile sets are declining in Bangladesh that makes an easy gateway for the customers to use cell phones. It will create an opportunity for the telecommunication industry by getting large number of customers. There are some other opportunities, which can be important factors for AKTEL are: Economic growth of Bangladesh, new and better interconnection agreement and future privatization of the fixed network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.11.4 Threats </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Widest Coverage of GrameenPhone </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">GrameenPhone has network coverage in 61 districts as TMIB. Yet GP’s coverage is better than TMIB’s coverage, as GP covers all the upazilas and rural areas. Because of the availability of network in distant places and good frequency, GP has a superior brand image to people. This is of course a threat to TMIB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Political Instability and Natural Calamity</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh is called red-zone in terms of political risks. The instability of administrative system has resulted in unstable regulations. With the change of Governments, regulations also change from season to season. This volatility has hindered TMIB from making a long-term effective strategy. At the same time, the country also has a high natural calamity tendency. Natural catastrophes damage the network towers situated in different districts of the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Recession in the Economy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile phone is still considered as a ‘luxury’ in Bangladesh rather than a necessity. Being one of the developing nations in the world, the risk of recession in Bangladesh is very high and frequent. During the recessions, people are reluctant to invest behind luxury items such as mobile phones. This is a huge obstacle for TMIB to reach all population sectors in the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Non-cooperative Telecommunication Regulatory Body</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The regulatory bodies in the telecommunication ministry are unfair and biased. Plus, the system itself is bureaucratic and lengthy in Bangladesh. Because of their non-cooperative attitude and injustice, the usual work place of TMIB is slowing down. This is of course a risk to the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Customer Resistance against Tariff</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any new tariff or VAT is always a controversial issue to the people of our country. People in Bangladesh are reluctant to accept new tariffs and it takes a long time for them to approve it. In the budget of 2005-2006, the government imposed a tax of Tk 900 on every SIM card, which has created a huge debate and protest among customers. Many of the customers have stopped buying SIM cards. This tax also hindered the mobile operators to maintain a constant price level and to offer attractive packages.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Existing Competitors in the Market</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, there are four private and one public mobile phone operators operating in the Bangladeshi market. All of the private operators are aligned with foreign companies. These companies are following aggressive marketing strategy and the level of rivalry offers every week at a striking price level. This high intensity of competition in the industry is a major threat to TMIB, as TMIB has to survive this fast paced competition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Threats of potential New Entrants</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Besides the existing competitors, new and large competitors are also trying to enter the Bangladeshi market. Dhabi Group is on the verge of starting their operations soon. Also some other companies like Reliance, Tata etc. are trying to make an entry to our market. These new companies will increase the rivalry in the industry. Potential new entrants can get into the telecommunication market with cost effective approach and take off market shares. New domestic and foreign cellular phone companies can start telecommunication network business. As Bangladeshi people are very much price sensitive it may cause serious problem for AKTEL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Private T&amp;T Phone Companies</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the new and existing mobile phone operators, competition is also expected from private T&amp;T phone companies. Because of the inadequacy of the public T&amp;T Company, many private companies are coming in the market. These companies are also a threat to TMIB, as they offer similar services at a lower price to customers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Possible Health Risk from Mobile Phone</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, a scientific study has shown that there is high risk of health hazard including brain tumor and cancer from the usage of mobile phone. The study concluded that long time use of mobile phone might cause such diseases and so people should reduce of mobile phone. Though there is no solid evidence of this fact, it has created an argument and panic among mobile phone users. This is naturally a threat to TMIB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>T&amp;T Mobile</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">T&amp;T is now entering the mobile telecommunication industry. It is now becoming an immense threat to for all other mobile phone operators by providing unfair advantages and cause severe problems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Reduction of NWD and ISD Call Charge by BTTB</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Recently BTTB has reduced its NWD and ISD call charges to promote LAN phone usages. This has affected the mobile phone industry and significantly reflected in the revenue earning of BTTB</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Price War</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">All the five companies operating in our telecom industry are fighting to get the market share in favor of them by cutting price of the mobile phone connection. All competitors are lowering the unit price and also providing pulse facility like AKTEL provides 1-second pulse for post-paid connection and ten-second pulses for pre-paid connection. So all the players in the market have an aggressive attitude, in terms of the pricing strategy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.12 AKTEL – Served Market</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKtel is providing the service using GSM 900 technology. Although their transmission quality is not questionable to the consumers, they are behind in terms of network coverage in the countrywide. They have 160 characters SMS interconnectivity with GP and BanglaLink. They have introduced GPRS recently. The post-paid consumers of AKtel are now using GPRS since August 2005.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Besides having the business and family consumer functions, AKtel have information services for their subscribers. But it is not that much intensive like GP. To enhance the post-paid subscriber base, in June 2006 the company launched a new package named <i>‘Infinity’</i> with zero line rent and no SIM price and also redefined the regular post-paid package to attract more customers to subscribe to AKTEL post-paid connection.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Primarily AKtel focused on the business users in Dhaka and Chittagong. They did not have any pre-paid service, which is more appropriate for students and general individuals until 2002. Then after by different offers AKtel tried to spread their focus on other customer segments. In 2003 and 2004 AKtel became very popular by giving packages with BTTB connectivity at c</p></div></div>

Form analyzing the characteristics of the product life cycle the characteristic, marketing objective &amp; strategies the companies are setting up to. The sales in the mobile industry are rapidly increasing. The cost is average per customer. Profits are marginally increasing. Customers are more or less early adopters. They are aware of the services that have been offered to them more precisely. The competitors are growing in number. The common marketing objective of all the companies are to maximize there market share. On the market strategies segment the product strategy is on the offer product extensions and on service orientation. More and more offers of value added service and added features are included in the package. The pricing strategy is to penetrate the market. So they are all more or less following the penetration pricing strategy. In distribution strategy the industry is the building on intensive distribution. More and more emphasis is given on gaining the market. So distributing the product to the far corners of the country has become a priority. In case advertising &amp; promotional strategy the companies are all in aggressive advertising policy. Using all the possible media uses to increase the market share &amp; reaching potential customers in mass market. Lastly in sales promotion the companies are on a rampage. They are offering enormous amount of services with the same package &amp; low cost rate with different events all round the year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Situation Analysis</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b>PEST Analysis</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PEST analysis is concerned with the environmental influences on a business. The acronym stands for the Political, Economic, Social and Technological issues that could affect the strategic development of a business. Identifying PEST influences is a useful way of summarizing the external environment in which a business operates. However, it must be followed up by consideration of how a business should respond to these influences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Political Factors </b>Marketing strategy is deeply affected by political perspectives. The government of Bangladesh has given mobile sector ample amount of freedom to do business. There were some stiff regulations that hindered the possible entry in the mid 90’s but as technology entered the new millennia government freed the way for companies to enter the market. Government in a way is the regulatory entity as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Economic Factors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This factor is also an important factor. Usually economic environment is analyzed with reference to the following key economic factors: employment, CPI, personal income, real GNP etc. The economy has been a major roller coaster ride. Though the government claims that the economy is stable and the GDP is on the rise, the personal disposal income is still in question. But these factors are not influencing the consumers. The growth has been tremendous over the last few years. Especially this year after Banglalink entered the market. GrameenPhone reached an astonishing 50 lakh customers this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Social Factors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ultimate test of a business is its social relevance. An important aspect of the social environment concerns the values consumers hold. Values mainly revolve around a number of fundamental concerns regarding time, environment, personal finance, diversity etc Orientation towards time: Convenience is a critical source of differential advantage, particularly in the service sector. Youth are making or influencing more household decisions. Moreover as the population ages time pressures become more widespread and acute. The interest to acquire and use new technology has been a big factor. Everybody wants to be connected with each other &amp; having a mobile connection has become a social status for some part of the population. Diversity of Lifestyle: Mobile phones have given a diversified lifestyle to the society. The diversification &amp; integration and doing multi tasking has become more easy day by day. The connections in the rural areas have given a touch of focusing the rural business with the business of that of the capital.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Technological Factors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Technological factors include the use if technology in doing business. Up to date use technology helps to acquire the economies of scale for the company and cost savings. It also gives them the opportunity to expand in the future. Currently in Bangladesh the mobile phone companies are not exactly using the state of the art of technology. Although different multinational companies like Siemens, Nokia &amp; Ericsson helping but they need to be updated more.</p><h6 style="text-align: justify;">Porters 5 Forces Model</h6><p style="text-align: justify;">To survive in an industry, grow, sustain in competition &amp; differentiate a company must understand the dynamics of the industry competition among firms. Mr. Michael Porter has developed a framework known as 5 forces model. His model focuses on following 5 five forces that shape competition within an industry, i.e. –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ Potential Competitors</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ Bargaining power of buyers</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ Bargaining power of suppliers</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ Closeness of substitutes to an industry’s products</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ Rivalry among established firms</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After analyzing the above factors we can know the competition prevailing in the mobile phone industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. Potential Competitors</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Potential Entrants are companies that are not currently competing in the industry but have the capability to do so if they choose.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The risk of entry by potential competitors is a function of height of Barriers to Entry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>i. Brand Loyalty</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Large companies enjoy a brand loyalty in the market through its huge customer base, customer retention ratio, reputation, high product quality &amp; after sales service.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are large established companies in mobile telecommunication sector, i.e. –GrameenPhone, Banglalink, CityCell &amp; Teletalk who have brand loyal customers &amp; enjoy a competitive position in the market. So whatever product/service they come up in the future they can easily capture market share. This makes it difficult for new entrants to fight with these established brands for gaining market share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ii. Absolute Cost Advantage </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Absolute Cost Advantage arise from following sources; i.e. – product diversification, pricing strategy etc, they represent lower risk than entrants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In mobile telecommunication industry companies have long experience in this sector. Some of them have experience in doing business in different parts of the world. Using that experience here &amp; following those successful strategies gives the companies some cost advantages as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>iii. Economies of Scale</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sources of economies of scale are i.e. – discounts on bulk purchases cards, advantages gained by spreading fixed production cost over a large production volume and cost savings associated with spreading marketing/advertising expense over a large output.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In telecommunication industry the companies get 2% – 5% discounts from card making companies because of bulk purchase, can spread fixed cost over huge number of conversions &amp; save advertising costs over their large output.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>iv. Customer Switching Costs</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Switching costs arise when it costs a customer time, energy &amp; money to switch from products offered by established firms to products offered by new entrants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Because of intense competition in the market the switching cost is very low right now. The companies are offering very low connection fee. So there is a tendency of customers using multiple company service at the same time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>v. Government Regulation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Government regulation summarizes government’s policy towards setting up new industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü The newly imposed tax of Tk 1,200 on every mobile SIM (subscriber identification module) card and connection</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü The government had reduced the mobile handset tariff in fiscal 2004-05 to Tk 1,500 from the previous Tk 4,000</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. Bargaining Power of Buyers</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An industry’s buyers are individual customers who consume products, as end users &amp; retailer’s are who buy it for selling to customers. The customers and the dealers are the main buyers in the mobile industry. It gives them more bargaining power over the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>c. Bargaining Power of Suppliers</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It refers to the ability of suppliers to raise input prices, threat to stop selling products &amp; delay in delivering products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The suppliers are the mobile SIM card providers. They don’t have that much of bargaining power with the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>d. Closeness of substitutes to an industry’s products</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Substitutes are products that of different business that can satisfy similar customer needs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In mobile telecommunication the close substitute is the BTTB land phones &amp; some other new wireless fixed phones. BTTB land phone connections have been there for the last 30 years and so but the mobile phone connection out numbered them in a couple of years. So they are not a big threat now. The new wireless FIXED phones are relatively new in the market so they are not opposing any direct threat to the mobile sector as well. Moreover these phones are targeting some specific segments of the market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>e. Rivalry among established firms</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rivalry refers to the competitive struggle between companies in an industry to gain market share from each other using price, product design, superior product offering, advertising spending, after sales service &amp; support. The intensity of rivalry among companies in an industry is a function of industry competitive structure, demand condition &amp; height of exit barriers in the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>i. Industry Competitive Structure</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It refers to the number &amp; size distribution of companies within that industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladesh the mobile phone industry falls under consolidated industry representing a small number of large companies, i.e. –GrameenPhone, AKTel, Banglalink, CityCell &amp; Teletalk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ii. Demand Conditions</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The current demand in the market for connection is very high. On a average every company is launching a new product or extensions every month. Price sensitive customers are really switching connections every time a new package comes out.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>iii. Exit Barriers</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exit Barriers represents investment in fixed asset, high fixed cost, equipment &amp; economic dependence on industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">All the companies entered the market with huge initial investment and strong market commitment strategy. So the exit barrier is very high.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Competitors</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The term competition defies definition because the view of competition held by different groups varies. Most firms define competition in crude, simplistic and unrealistic terms. Some firms fail to identify the true source of competition; others underestimate the capabilities and reactions of their competitors. When the business climate is stable, a shallow outlook toward the competition might work, but in the current environment, a business strategy is really competitively oriented. In the telecom sector of Bangladesh the competition is really strategic oriented competition. Studied deployment of resources based on a high degree of insight into the systematic cause and effect in the business environment. Ever changing technological advances in the technological industry, customer demand and the scope of investment in this sector has made Bangladesh a profitable target for various multi national companies to setup mobile companies here. TELENOR, Telecom Malaysia, SingTel &amp; Orascom are the major MNCs to enter Bangladesh with GrameenPhone, AKTel, CityCell and Banglalink CityCell. Event the government regulated company BTTB has come forward to join the competition with TELETALK. AKTel’s major competition comes from all the four companies mentioned above. All the companies are aggressively marketing there product. Especially after Orascom entered Bangladesh earlier this year gave the competition a new edge. The customers are looking for the best buy with bundled features &amp; low price talk time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>GrameenPhone</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">GrameenPhone is the largest mobile company in Bangladesh. With a customer over 4 million GrameenPhone has been the ultimate example of success in Bangladesh. Strong network &amp; flexibility in the price &amp; service category quickly made the company a market leader.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Vision:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The vision of GrameenPhone Ltd. is “To be the leading provider of telecommunication services all over Bangladesh with satisfied customers, shareholders and enthusiastic employees”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Objective</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">GrameenPhone Ltd. has a duel objective to receive an economic return on its investments and to contribute to the economic development of Bangladesh through telecommunication. This is why Grameen Phone, in collaboration with Grameen Bank and Grameen Telecom, is aiming to place one phone in each village to contribute significantly to the economic benefit of the poor. It is on the way to bring a total revolution in the telecommunication field. By attaining the success factors, Grameen Phone would like to be recognized as a reliable, honest and committed company to its valued subscribers and stakeholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i> Strategy</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The basic strategy of GrameenPhone Ltd. is for the overall coverage of both urban and rural areas. It builds continues coverage, cell after cell, with an intention to bring the whole country under its network. Though the priority of the intensity of coverage varies from area to area, the basic strategy of cell-to-cell coverage is applied through the whole country. Presently it has network coverage in 57 districts around the country including all six divisional headquarters, with 749 base stations in operation. GrameenPhone’s strength comes in their strong network capability, extended product line and services attracted the customers very quickly. GrameenPhone offers a number of products and value-added services to its valued subscribers. These attractive products and services are designed to cater to the needs of the individual subscribers. There are six products currently being offered by GrameenPhone. The products are: GP Regular, GP National, Anytime 300, Anytime 500, EASY GOLD and EASY Pre-paid. In addition, GrameenPhone offers a number of Value-added Services (AS) to its subscribers. These include Text Messaging (SMS), Voice Mail, Fax/Data service and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). The SMS-based Push-Pull Service was also launched in January 2003. Also GrameenPhone’s subsidiary DJuice created a heavy buzz in the market when introduced in the middle of 2005. GrameenPhone targeted the younger generation of audiences with the brand and became an instant hit. The made heavy promotions for the brand &amp; value added services that they were providing with it. Concerts, fairs etc attracted people to buy DJuice. Product positioning &amp; repositioning is one of the major strength of the company. Their product line is one of the most comprehensive in the business. Services are launched keeping in mind each and every segment of the market. They also reposition their product on the basis of change in the environment. Price flexibility is another strategy that the company follows prominently. In case of product overlap (i.e. easy pre paid &amp; DJuice), occasions or simply for promotion the company exercises the price flexibility issue effectively. GrameenPhone’s creative cell is one of the best in the country. Their recent advertisements are a big hit in the country. They spend more than anyone in the ad campaign in this industry. GrameenPhone believes that good business leads to good development, since high level of productivity is development. The activities of GP contribute to the socio-economic development of Bangladesh in many different ways. In the sports arena, GP is currently sponsoring the Bangladesh National Cricket Team for a period of two years through 2003-2005.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;">CityCell</h4><p style="text-align: justify;">CityCell (Pacific Bangladesh Telecom Limited) is Bangladesh’s pioneering mobile communications company and the only CDMA network operator in the country. CityCell is a customer-driven organization whose mission is to deliver the latest in advanced telecommunication services to Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Vision</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">To continue to be the leader in telecom industries in the region and provide complete communication solution to customers with a smile. <b></b></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company offers a full array of fixed and mobile services for consumers and businesses that are focused on the unique needs of the Bangladeshi community. CityCell’s growth strategy is to integrate superior customer service, highest standard technology and choice of packages at affordable rates. The company operates a 24-hour call centre with over 86 well trained operators to respond to customer queries. CityCell’s customer services are open 7 days a week to ensure customers can access CityCell at any convenient time. CityCell is focused on innovation and creating new ways for customers to stay in touch and to do business. CityCell’s is offering a wide range of competitive prepaid and postpaid mobile packages as well as Value Added Services such as SMS and information based services. CityCell is looking forward in introducing CDMA 1x technology in 2004 to provide innovative multimedia features, including Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and many more data based mobile features currently not available in Bangladesh. CityCell was the first entrant in Bangladesh with mobile phone but it is sad to say that the company couldn’t capitalized on the first movers advantages that it got from entering the market. CityCell could have created a lead for itself that others would have found difficult to match. Following the concept of the experience curve, if the first entrant gains a respectable share of the market, across the board costs should go down by a fixed percentage. But in the case of CityCell this didn’t happen. It is mainly because of the poor strategy selection by the top management. They followed a “island” strategy building strong network here &amp; there where they see the customers are buying CityCell connection.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In case of marketing strategy CityCell made some mistakes too. The advertisement &amp; promotional campaign wasn’t adequate to match those of GrameenPhone’s. No heavy promotional campaign was undertaken in the last 5-6 yrs or so. Even in the early entry stage CityCell was not too aggressive in marketing their services. They thought that entering the market first gives them the adequate market share &amp; they were happy with it. They didn’t consider the environmental change &amp; competition from the other companies that may enter Bangladesh in the future. So when competitors like Grameen, AKTel entered the market it was clear that CityCell will lose their market share significantly. CityCell also lacked in the product market as well. They are the only company in Bangladesh in operating the CDMA technology. This gives them some obvious disadvantages in the market. First of all CDMA technology prohibits users to change their mobile sets. So when cell phone manufacturing companies are bringing out these new phones every month the users of CityCell cannot switch to those phones. While other companies with GSM technology doesn’t have this barrier. Secondly CityCell product positioning was very limited from the beginning. They concentrated on the high income bracket target market form the start of their business. Even after the competition picked up it failed to reposition its product in the market. Thirdly the company failed to attract new target market with their promotional campaign. Hardly any CityCell advertisements were visible during the last 4-5 yrs up until now.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hopefully CityCell will find it course back sometimes soon because Singapore telecom giant SingTel bought 45% of CityCell’s share in the middle of 2005. The management hopes to diversify their service &amp; reach out to a larger population by the end of next year.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Banglalink</h4><p style="text-align: justify;">With the vision of “Banglalink understands people’s needs best and will create and deliver appropriate communication services to improve people’s life and make it easier” Banglalink entered the market in late 2004. Banglalink aims to understand peoples’ needs best and develop appropriate communication services to improve peoples’ life and make it simple. All their work is aimed towards meeting their vision. The company behind Banglalink is Orascom Telecom. It is one of the most dynamic telecommunications powerhouses in the world. Orascom is based in Egypt and has operations in 11 countries worldwide. Established in 1998, it is today the largest capitalized company on the Cairo &amp; Alexandria Stock Exchanges with over 11 million subscribers worldwide. It has grown to be one of the largest and most diversified GSM network operators in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Vision</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Banglalink understands people’s needs best and will create and deliver appropriate communication services to improve people’s life and make it easier. The biggest barrier today for people is the cost of handsets. Banglalink strive to lower the total cost of owning a mobile. They are here to help make a difference in people’s lives by providing affordable and reliable connectivity solutions. The company strives to connect people and link their lives by listening to them and by understanding their needs. They are here to help you speak your language.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tele Talk</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Teletalk Bangladesh Limited (TBL) is formed as Public limited company under the Companies Act 1994 on 26th December 2004. Therefore it is a Govt. owned company. Although a new entrant, Teletalk is staffed by experienced Telecom Engineers. Committed to accessibility, quality, coverage and price Teletalk launched it’s much anticipated Mobile Telecom service on commercial basis on 31st March 2005.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Warid Telecom</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A new Middle East Based telecom company named Warid Telecom is on its verge to enter into Bangladesh in the next few month. Their strategies are yet to be known to public. However rumor and public opinion expects Warid to make the mobile phone service industry further competitive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Value Chain Analysis</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The value chain analysis describes the activities the organization performs and links them to the organizations competitive position. Value chain analysis describes the activities within and around an organization, and relates them to an analysis of the competitive strength of the organization. Therefore, it evaluates which value each particular activity adds to the organizations products or services. This idea was built upon the insight that an organization is more than a random compilation of machinery, equipment, people and money. Only if these things are arranged into systems and systematic activates it will become possible to produce something for which customers are willing to pay a price. Porter argues that the ability to perform particular activities and to manage the linkages between these activities is a source of competitive advantage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Porter distinguishes between primary activities and support activities. Primary activities are directly concerned with the creation or delivery of a product or service. They can be grouped into five main areas:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Inbound logistics,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Operations,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Outbound logistics,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Marketing and sales, and service.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Each of these primary activities is linked to support activities which help to improve their effectiveness or efficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are four main areas of support activities:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Procurement,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Technology development (including R&amp;D),</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Human resource management, and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü Infrastructure (systems for planning, finance, quality, information management etc.).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel’s Value Chain Analysis</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel’s value chain is centered on the idea of lowering the cost structure and increase the perceived value if the products and service through differentiation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Primary Activities</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Research &amp; Development:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">R&amp;D is not only concerned about the product design and production process but also the segmentation and the needs of the customers. The customers are at the core of the activities of the function of AKTel. So the needs of the customers are always a preference for the company. The R&amp;D department are continuously on the market research to find out about the demand of a product which may be about to launch or will be launched in the future. The R&amp;D function can help to lower costs or permit a company to charge higher prices.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Production</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Production is considered with the creation of a good or service. In the case of AKTel it is in the service sector. To the production really takes place when the service is delivered to the customers. By performing its activities efficiently the production function of a company helps to lower its cost structure.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Marketing &amp; Sales</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">There are several ways in which the marketing and sales functions of a company help to create value. Through brand positioning and advertising, the marketing functions can increase the value that customers perceive to be contained in companies product. This is the most important value creation activity of AKTel in a sense that this is the way to survive in the market in Bangladesh at the moment. The rivalry is so high right now those competitors are putting cent percent effort on big ad campaigns. A detailed marketing plan of AKTel has been included in the AUDIT.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Customer Service</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The roles of service function of an enterprise are to provide after sale service and support. This function can create a perception of superior value in the minds of the customers by solving customer problems and supporting customers after they have purchased the product. AKTel lacks behind in this value creation category comparing to their competitors. The customer care service isn’t up to the mark. The after sales service is also not up to the expectations.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Supporting Activities</h4><p style="text-align: justify;">The supporting activities of the value chain provide inputs that allow the primary activities to take place. These activities are broken down in the following fuctions:</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Company infrastructure is the companywide context within all the value creation activities takes place; the organizational structure, control system, company culture. Because the top management can exert considerable influence in shaping these aspects of a company top management should also be viewed as part of the infrastructure of a company. AKTel’s organizational structure is basically a flat one with the view to smooth the communication process with upward and downward communication. But there are times when this gets affected. There are sometimes interdepartmental conflicts. On the other hand the control system is fairly centralized. The company practices strong intergrated culture within the organization.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Human Resource Management</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">There are a number of ways in which the human resource functions can help a company to create more value. This function ensures that the company has the right mix of skilled people to perform its value creation activities effectively. AKTel has a sound HR practice and tries to motivate the employees to keep up the good works. From giving incentives to organizing cultural activities to inspire the employees and give them the feeling of being a part of the family is given importance in AKTel.</p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">Technology</h1><p style="text-align: justify;">This is for managing inventory, tracking sales, pricing products, selling products, customer service inquires etc. The technologies used in the company are state not state of the art. The customer service centre needs to be up to date.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Different Levels of Strategy</b></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc121335818"></a><a name="_Toc121335787"></a>Functional Level Strategies</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Functional level strategies are the strategies that the companies take to improve the effectiveness of the company’s operation and thus its ability to attain superior efficiency, quality, innovation, and customer responsiveness. In each functional area identified by the strategist as needing goals and action plans, the aspects of the domain of each and the degree of detail entered into are matters of choice. Management’s concern in setting functional strategy should be to provide the firm’s functional officers with sufficient guidelines to carry out the functional parts of implementing other levels of strategy AKTel focuses on achieving superior quality throughout the functional level of the organization. Even though the service provided by the company may be of higher standard that does not imply that the company has achieved superior quality. Any company that has achieved superior quality would be able to reduce rework and delay costs. It would be able to service provider in such a fashion that would require less rework and less delays. It would be able to better utilize the time and materials of production. Hence, cost would ultimately go down- making it more efficient in manufacturing. In order to achieve such a state, AKTel should consider implementing Total Quality Management. At its essence, the strategy is build around the notion that doing something correctly in the first time is more profitable for the company. Even though zero defect tolerance policy might be too extreme for such a company as AKTel, it must make sure its defect and rework rate is at the minimum. The easy way to ensure that is by making sure that it is able to produce the required quality service.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Incorporating TQM with corporate culture</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TQM initially might increase the cost of production due to the strategies devotion to superior quality. However, as the company rides down the experience curve, the cost of production will go down substantially. Thus, at first the TQM policy might not be well accepted among the employees of the service providing companies. They might view the policy as inefficient and redundant. Hence, care must be taken so that the benefits of the policy are well-communicated among the employees of the organization. Historically it has been seen that self-managed teams are more effective in implementing TQM. However, self managed teams require substantial amount of decentralization. The concept of decentralization might be met with significant resistance from the upper management of the company. Still, AKTel should consider the possibilities offered by self-managed teams.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc121335819"></a><a name="_Toc121335788"></a>Business Level Strategy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the business level, the company follows the strategy of Focused Differentiation. It enables to provide its targeted market with quality service that is clearly differentiated from its competitors’ offerings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, mobile phone service is the kind of products for which the rates of innovations are fast. Innovation in the aspect of mobile phone service is product based. The companies in the market are practically in a war situation. They are at each others throat to get the customer. AKTel in that sense have to come up with new better ideas than the competitors if they want to sustain the competition. So differentiation strategy is a must for the company. The company can also</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Incorporating Differentiation strategy with corporate culture</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adopting a differentiation strategy would require a number of changes within the organization. Management of AKTel must work hard to minimize the bureaucratic costs. Grouping tasks and functions and efficiently using integrating mechanism to better coordinate the tasks and functions is highly recommended. In addition, the company must clearly allocate authority and responsibility and properly define its goals to its employees. Flattening the organizational structure might prove fruitful.</p><h5 style="text-align: justify;">Corporate Level Strategy</h5><p style="text-align: justify;">The principal concerns of corporate level strategy are to identify in the business in which should participate, the value creation activities it should perform in those businesses and the best means for expanding or constructing in different businesses.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Strategic Outsourcing</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel’s corporate strategy revolves around strategic outsourcing. It involves spreading out some of a company’s value creation activity within a business and letting them be performed by a specialist in that activity. In other words strategic outsourcing is concerned with reducing the boundaries of the company and focusing on the fewer value creation functions. From the setup of the network to distribution of its card AKTel has outsourced many of its works. AKTel engaged in strategic outsourcing because they believe that they can better execute their business model by doing so and thus increase profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Reducing cost through outsourcing</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Out sourcing is an activity that will reduce cost when the price that must be paid to a specialist company to perform that activity is less than what it would cost the company to perform that activity internally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel’s distribution is strictly based on outsourcing. Refill cards are distributed through a third party. This way they reduce the distribution cost and overhead cost of running an vertically integrated distribution channel.</p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">Performance Oriented</h1><p style="text-align: justify;">For both service and marketing department performance will be one of the criterions to evaluate employee performance. Profit sharing will be part of the pay package of the employees that will ensure the higher employee performance</p><h5 style="text-align: justify;">AKTel’s Corporate Social Responsibility</h5><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTEL is a dynamic and leading end-to-end countrywide GSM mobile operator. As a committed corporate citizen of Bangladesh, AKTEL provides yearly scholarships to meritorious and financially needy Bangladeshi students for Bachelor degrees in Multimedia University, Malaysia. AKTEL will offer scholarships for the academic year 2006-2007.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Strategic Control </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">These are the formal target setting measurement and feedback system that allows managers to evaluate whether the company has achieving superior efficiency, quality, innovation and customer responsiveness. Personal Control is the desire to shape and influence the behavior of a person in face to face interaction in the pursuit of the company’s goal. For AKTel this is more applicable because managers can questions and probe subordinates about the problems or issues they are facing to get a better understanding. Output control is a system where managers’ estimates or forecasts appropriate performance goals for each division and employees and then measures actual performance on these goals. It motivates the employees. For AKTel it is going in to a broad focus business in the future can help to keep track of the business by implementing this control system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Implementing Differentiation Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In pursuing a differentiation strategy the company will start to produce a wider range of packages and serve more market segments, which means it has to customize its products to the needs if different groups of customers. So to implement this managers should develop a more sophisticated control system increasingly make use of technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Implementing a Broad Focus based Product Line Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Because the recommended strategy is to go for more broad focus based product line differentiation the company must first decide how to group overall product line into product groups or categories so that each product groups can be developed at lowest cost consistent with permitting the differentiation needed to create value for customers. Now to keep costs as low as possible the decision is made to centralize the support value chain functions like information system at the top management of the organization and the different product groups share their services. Strategic control system can now be developed to measure the performance of each product group separately from the others. Thus the performance of each product group is easy to monitor and evaluate. Strategic reward system can be more applicable here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Competitive Advantages</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In case of competitive advantages AKTel is seeking Differentiation focus, Cost focus and Cost leadership at the same time.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategy – Differentiation Focus</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY is one of creating a product or service that is perceived as being unique “throughout the industry”. AKTel was the first telecommunication company to introduce GPRS, entertainment packages like Fun Dose etc. Their step to setup “CLUB MAGNET” for their loyal customers with special offers from them &amp; affiliated companies are also an indication of the differentiation focus.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategy – Cost Leadership</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A COST LEADERSHIP STRATEGY is based on the concept that the company can produce and market a good quality product or service at a lower cost than its competitors. These low costs should translate to profit margins that are higher than the industry average. AKTel’s recent package “Exceed” gives the indication that the company is trying to attain this strategy and command over the competitors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Strategy – Cost Focus</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A FOCUS STRATEGY may be the most sophisticated of the generic strategies, in that it is a more ‘intense’ form of either the cost leadership or differentiation strategy. It is designed to address a “focused” segment of the marketplace, product form or cost management process and is usually employed when it isn’t appropriate to attempt an ‘across the board’ application of cost leadership or differentiation. AKTel’s new offerings, redefining the post packages indicates that they are trying to follow this strategy as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Existing Market Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel’s marketing strategy is diverged. They use different type of marketing strategy to get the desired market share and the target segment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Market Scope Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel is serving at different distinct segment of the market without focusing on a particular one. This gives them an opportunity to expand their coverage in the market. To implement this multi-market strategy the company is focused to those segments that it feels most comfortable and in which the company is able to avoid confronting the companies that serve the entire market. Their implementation is done through selling different products in the different segments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Market Geographic Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the start the company has taken a national marketing strategy to cover the whole Bangladesh market. Gradually they set upped the network and now they are covering almost 60 districts of the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Market Commitment Strategy </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel follows a strong market commitment strategy. With Telecom Malaysia &amp; AK Khan group in its backbone the company invested heavily in the market. The strong commitment strategy gives the company a chance to operate in a market optimally by realizing economies of scale in promotion, distribution and so on. Challenge from competitors like GrameenPhone, Banglalink for the position in the market is handled by AKTel by aggressively fighting back with different forms of product, price, promotion &amp; distribution strategies. In other words because the company has a high stake in the market it does all it can to defend its position.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Product Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The implementation of the product strategies requires cooperating among different groups: finance, research and development, the corporate staff, and marketing. This level of integration makes the product strategies difficult to develop and implement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Product Positioning Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The term positioning refers to placing a brand in that part of the market where it will receive a favorable reception compared to competing products. AKTel’s single brand positioning gives them benefits to play a dominate role in the core segment. This strategy gives them the flexibility to attract customers for the other segments outside its core segments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pricing Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Broadly speaking pricing objective can be either profit oriented or volume oriented. AKTel pursue both at the same time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pricing Strategy for New Products</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For their new products AKTel follows penetration-pricing strategy, so they can enter the market with a low initial price and capture a greater market share. Because of high price elasticity of demand they are adopting this strategy. It also gives them option to achieve economies of scale.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pricing Strategy For Established Products</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In case of their established prepaid &amp; postpaid product AKTel is following reduces price strategy. For all existing prepaid &amp; post paid services the company uses the reduced tariffs. It can identified as a defensive strategy responding to the competition, offensive in nature because suing the experience curve concept costs across the board go down by a fixed percentage every time experiences double or it can be because of the customer needs. Lowering the prices sometimes becomes prerequisite for inducing the market to grow, customers’ need may then become the pivot of marketing strategy, all other marketing aspects are developed accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Distribution Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel distribution strategy is not vertically integrated with the organization. They outsource the distribution to a third party. They have</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· NERO (non exclusive retail organization)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Dealers</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Exclusive distributors</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Promotional Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Promotional strategies are concerned with the planning, implementation and control of persuasive communication with the consumer. For AKTel these strategies are revolved around advertising, sales promotions and special offers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Promotional Mix Strategy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AKTel in promotional aspect follows the promotional mix strategy. It basically covers the following factors</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Product factor</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Market factor</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Customer factor</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Budget factor</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Marketing mix factor</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Environmental factor</p><p style="text-align: justify;">They follow this strategy to adequately blend the three types of promotion to complement each other for a balanced promotional perspective. To advertise their products and services to the market AKTel uses various types of media that are available. From television commercials to Newspaper and magazine they are now even sponsoring the evening news headlines. This of course falls under their advertising copy strategy. One important factor is that AKTel uses both PUSH &amp; PULL strategy at the same time. They have their in house advertising campaign department. But they outsource their other big ad plans to ad firms as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conclusion </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In concluding remarks it can be said that Aktel is a doing fairly ok in their strategic policy but because of extensive competition in the market it needs to shake things up. Because it won’t be long the company may lose their core customers to its competitors if it doesn’t take some counter measures. The customers are demanding and they are willing to switch to other brands, as there are other options available in the market</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Recommendation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aktel was doing fairly well up until this year. Because of the entrance of BanglaLink in the market the competition is heating up. The consumers are very price sensitive in our country. The offering of new packages at lower price by the competitors along with heavy promotion has been affecting the company. The growth of the company has not been up to the mark like that of Grameenphone or BanglaLink. Grameenphone extended their market size by 1 million only by a six months gap by introducing a subsidiary brand Djuice. BanglaLink on the other hand is going on a rampage with their sales promotion and advertising. They are offering at a lower cost all around the clock during day and night.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So keep up with market and grow as it plans Aktel must reinvent itself in the industry itself. They should not modify the only a single strategy rather reposition their existing marketing mix with modification.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>___________________________________List of Reference </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We used the following sources for secondary data:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.aktel.com/">www.aktel.com</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.gsmworld.com/">www.gsmworld.com</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.telecomasia.com/">www.telecomasia.com</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.isoc.org/inet2000/cdproceedings/8c/8c_2.htm">www.isoc.org/inet2000/cdproceedings/8c/8c_2.htm</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.asiatradehub.com/bangladesh/telecom.asp">www.asiatradehub.com/bangladesh/telecom.asp</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.telenor.no/om/ir/presentasjon/gp/gp_presentation_2005.pdf">www.telenor.no/om/ir/presentasjon/gp/gp_presentation_2005.pdf</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.btrc.org.bd/ngnworkshop.htm">www.btrc.org.bd/ngnworkshop.htm</a></p></div></div>

9016	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The term “alternative dispute resolution” or “ADR” is often used to The describe a wide variety of dispute resolution mechanisms that are short of, or alternative to full-scale court processes or judicial process-illustrate and explain.</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong><strong>1.      </strong><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The term “alternative dispute resolution” or “ADR” is often used to The describe a wide variety of dispute resolution mechanisms that are short of, or alternative to full-scale court processes or judicial process. In March 1998 the United States Agency for International Developments (USAID) Centre for Democracy and Governance published an extensive manual entitled Alternative Dispute Resolution Practitioners’ Guide (ADR Practitioners’ Guide).Various scopes of ADR have broadly been discussed in this guide. ADR is a process which may be freestanding (non-judicial), or court annexed (judicial), bindings or non-binding, formal or informal, mandatory or voluntary in nature. It is to be emphasized that the term ADR is misleading in a sense that it is not always alternative to formal litigation and very often it is a part of litigation particularly for those ADR processes which are court-connected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This essay will be discussed in two separate parts in the context of ADR. One is “the scope of applicability of ADR”. And another is “Appling ADR to resolve dispute which involves crime?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>2.</strong> <strong>The scope of applicability of ADR:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“The ADR Practitioners” Guide spells out how ADR can apply the different scopes. It explains that ADR systems may be designed to meet a wide variety of different scopes. Some of them are directly related to improving the administration of justice and rule of law. Some, however are related to other development objectives, such as economic restructuring, or the management of tensions and conflicts in communities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Kinds of Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are various kinds of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that could be employed as per the needs and requirements of the dispute in question. The standard mechanisms in usage can be broadly divided into two categories binding and non-binding procedures. These procedures may be also classified into primary procedures and hybrids/derivatives of these primary procedures:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>3.1</strong> <strong>Primary Procedures</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>3.1.1 Negotiation/ Private Judging </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Negotiation is always available to parties in a dispute, and is often an excellent process. The negotiating parties may even end up settling their disputes by constructing an agreement. This process provides an organized</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> yet informal method of identifying the issues of contention between the two parties, outlining their respective interests and persuading each other to resolve the dispute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.1.2 Mediation </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> It is difficult to present a single broad and comprehensive definition of mediation process because of the extensive variety of different ways in which the mediation process can take place. Mediation can be defined as the intervention into a conflict by an acceptable, impartial, and neutral third party. However, this third party, the mediator, does not have a qualitative decision-making power to assist the parties in voluntarily reaching their own mutually acceptable settlement of the issues in conflict.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mediation can be broadly classified as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>3.1.2.1 Facilitative Mediation </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this kind of mediation, the mediator abstains from offering ideas and encourages the parties to bring ideas in.a facilitative mediation, the mediator takes an active role only in controlling the “process”. The process means things like setting the ground rules for how the problem will be solved. The mediator asks questions to identify the interests of the parties and the real issues in the disagreement. The mediator abstains from suggesting solutions, offering opinions etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.1.2.2 Evaluative Mediation </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An evaluative mediation focuses on the legal rights of the parties rather than their interests. The mediators role in this kind of mediation is to hear the different points of view and speculate on what a judge and jury would decide if this case were brought to the court. The mediator evaluates the issues at hand and tries to come to a workable resolution of the dispute. Since this type of evaluation requires a mediator with legal expertise, evaluative mediators are often at all means of experts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>3.1.2.3 Transformative Mediation </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this type of mediation the mediator does not direct the parties to topics or issues rather encourages the parties to present their open and honest narratives in order to change or transform the nature of parties conflict interaction by enabling them to appreciate each others viewpoints and to enable them to handle the conflict in a productive manner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.1.3 Arbitration </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arbitration is an adjudicatory dispute resolution process in which or more arbitrators issues a judgment on the merits (which may be binding or non-binding) after an expedited , adversarial hearing, in which each party has the opportunity to present proofs and arguments. Usually, arbitration emanates from a contract between two parties. In such a case either of the parties can invoke the arbitration clause and make an endeavor to resolve the dispute in light of the terms and conditions of the said agreement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arbitration is different from mediation because the neutral arbitrator has the authority to make a decision about the dispute. Compared to traditional trials, arbitration can usually be completed more quickly and is less formal. For example, often the parties do not have to follow state or federal rules of evidence and in some cases, the arbitrator is not required to apply the governing law. The parties can either decide the procedure mutually and get their dispute resolved by an independent arbitrator or get their dispute resolved by any of the flexibility and autonomy to tailor make the procedure as per their needs and requirements, which eventually leads to a cost-effective resolution of the dispute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another valuable feature of the interference model is the high proportion of cases that are settled voluntarily. Therefore, in terms of how many cases reach a voluntary settlement and how few decisions are successfully appealed to the Courts, the performance of compulsory expert arbitration in the interference procedure is a very good example of how well a similar system could work for the settlement of disputes after grant of exclusive privilege.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.2 Hybrid and derivative procedures</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.2.1 Expedited Arbitration</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Expedited arbitration is an arbitration procedure that is carried out in a shorter time and at a reduced cost. It is a procedure employed by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) that condenses a regular procedure of arbitration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to achieve this objective, the expedited arbitration provides for certain stringent rules<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>that make it stand apart from regular arbitration. In this procedure the request for arbitration is accompanied by a statement of claim and involves a sole arbitrator rather than a three-member tribunal. A statement of defense including the counterclaim is to be accompanied along with the answer to the request for arbitration within 20 days. A reply to the counterclaim is to be submitted within 20 days after the receipt of the statement of defense and hearings are to take place within 30 days after the receipt of the answer to the request for arbitration. The proceeding shall close within three months of the said statement of defense or the establishment of the tribunal (whichever is later) and a final award shall be submitted within one month of the said closure of proceedings. The procedure also puts an upper limit on the costs to be borne by the parties for the procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.2.2 Expert Determination </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Expert determination is a procedure whereby the parties to a dispute submit to an expert all or certain matters which have arisen which may arise between them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Expert determinations are especially suitable where it is necessary to determine issues of technical or scientific nature. The expert involvement is based on a contract between the parties. The expert determination may be binding on all or have effect as a recommendation to the parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Disputed issues that may benefit from expert determination include the valuation of an intellectual property asset or the establishment of royalty rates, the interpretation of the claims of a patent, the extent of the rights that are covered by a license etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.2.3 Mini trial </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a voluntary process in which cases are heard by a panel of high level principals from the disputing sides with full settlement authority, a neutral may or may not oversee this stage. First, parties have a summary hearing, each side presenting the essence of their case. The process normally reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each partys case and motivates the party representatives to settle the dispute amicably. If an agreement is reached, it is set out in writing and signed by the representatives and shall be binding on the parties. However, if the parties cannot settle the dispute, the proceedings will terminate in the days after the date of the information exchange.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many trials are most effective and most frequently used in disputes involving large corporations with relatively equal bargaining power and are a good method for resolving disputes in which the underlying law is fairly settled. Like other modes of resolution, many trials are totally confidential and any offers or statements made in the process are inadmissible at a court trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Advantages of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to related disputes:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The alternative dispute resolution mechanisms shower a whole range of advantages on the parties as against the conventional mode of dispute resolution by courts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.1 Forum Certainty </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Intellectual property rights are territorial by nature i.e. any dispute pertaining to the intellectual property shall be dealt with by only that particular jurisdiction in which the said right is registered or protection is conferred. With the global exploitation of IP, various complexities with respect to Intellectual Property disputes have arisen like multiplicity in court proceedings in the various jurisdictions concerned. Problems further get multiplied when there are inconsistent outcomes from the court proceedings at the various jurisdictions where the dispute is being contested.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the very foundation of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism is an agreement between the two parties, the parties can therefore, mutually decide and make a choice as to the preferred forum. Therefore, this mechanism condenses a plethora of potential disputes across the globe into one single procedure and thereby simplifies the dispute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.2 Party Autonomy </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The parties can decide and agree upon any of the standard procedures for dispute resolution or even come up with the procedure of their own. The parties can take up any of the established modes for dispute resolution, can decide the tentative time, the number of hearings, the limit of disclosure, etc. The parties may also choose the applicable law, place as well as the language of the proceeding. The Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure awards the parties to the dispute the opportunity to exercise greater control over the way their dispute is to be resolved. This factor plays a major role in increasing the efficiency of the procedure and also cutting down the time and cost of the procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.3 Cost Saving Mechanism </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If properly handled, the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms offer speedier resolution of disputes than adjudication in a court of law. An average expenditure in a patent dispute in a US court, taking into consideration the appeals to the Supreme Court would roughly come down to $2 to $4 million to litigate. the expenditure multiplies manifold when the disputes are being contested in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.4 Confidentiality </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Patent disputes involve inventions, technical know-how and other information and it becomes necessary to disclose and described the invention or certain parts of the same to prove the novelty and innovation in the said invention. Adjudication in a court of law is carried out publicly and any of the documents submitted before the court become public documents and therefore can be examined by anyone. Though in certain jurisdictions, on request/application made by either party and in case of a multi-jurisdictional international dispute, suppression or gagging orders could be obtained to secure such confidential information, it is highly improbable to expect such orders to be granted to the party by the courts in all the jurisdictions. Disclosure of such sensitive information, even in a single jurisdiction, could prove fatal for such invention and the party concerned.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.5 Avoiding regional issues </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every region and its corresponding legal system have unique characteristics and problems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.5.1 Developing and Under-Developed Countries </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The problems due to corruption and red-tapism usually infest the landscape of most of the developing and the underdeveloped counties where these practices often jeopardize the system of dispute resolution. Another glaring problem is that of an underdeveloped legal system and an under-developed Intellectual Property regime. This makes it hard for the foreign party to convince the fairly young system in the applicability of well established doctrines and principles employed and practiced elsewhere. This gives one party an undue advantage over the other party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.5.2 Developed Countries </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Problems are not localized only to the young systems but are blatantly evident in the most developed systems as well. Extraordinary costs in patent litigation and problems due to parallel litigation on the same EPO application leading to inconsistent outcomes, for instance, are glaring examples of problems faced by the European patent litigation system. Due to inconsistency of judgments within the European Union itself, neither of the parties to the dispute stands satisfied after investing huge sums in litigation. European Union has been struggling with this problem of fragmentation for quite some time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By choosing an independent and autonomous dispute resolution mechanism, the parties can avoid these problems as the prerogative to make a choice of procedure, laws, language etc. lies solely with the parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.6 Lucid process ensuring consistency </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The simplicity of the procedure is another area where the alternative modes of dispute resolution edge over the often so complex litigation procedure. The very fact that the parties have autonomy to elect the preferred procedure rules out the possibility of delays due to technical hitches which are ever so blatant in a civil litigation. The alternative modes of dispute resolution give the parties enough flexibility to simplify the procedure as per their requirement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the alternative methods of dispute resolution ensure consistency especially in cases where two parties have ongoing parallel litigation which often leads to inconsistent and even contrary results leaving both the parties dissatisfied. A classic example of inconsistency in the outcomes of parallel litigation is the Epilady cases where parallel litigation went on in various jurisdictions resulting in different outcomes and correspondingly different interpretations. Both in Germany and Holland, the claimant succeeded at trial whereas in Britain he was held to be an infringer.<strong><br/></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Disadvantages or Limitations of ADR</strong>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although, these alternative methods of dispute resolution have several potential advantages over litigation as given hereinabove, there is a need to assess and examine the limitations suffered by the existing mechanisms. The alternative mechanisms of dispute resolution do not always prove to be a good alternative to litigation. Therefore, we now need to assess as to whether the use of a private consensual mechanism like arbitration or mediation poses any threat to the resolution of such disputes?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.1 ADR Programs cannot correct systemic injustice, discrimination or violations of human rights</strong>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ADR systems often reflect the accepted norms of society. These norms may include discrimination against certain groups and populations. When this is true, ADR systems may hinder standards of group or individual rights. In India, for example, the lok adalots were generally credited with resolving large number of cases efficiently and cheaply in the mid-1980s before the system was taken over by the government judiciary. Women, however did not like this system, especially for family disputes, because resolution of disputes was based on local norms, which often were discriminatory towards women.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 5.2 ADR programs do not work well in the context of extreme power imbalance between parties.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">These power imbalances are often the result of discriminatory norms in society. Even when the imbalance is not a reflection of discriminatory social norms, most ADR systems don’t include legal or procedural protections for weaker parties. A more powerful or wealthy party may press the weaker into accepting an unfair result, so that the settlement may appear consensual, but in fact result from coercion.<strong><br/></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.3 ADR settlement does not have any educational or different effect on the population.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the results of ADR programs are not public, ADR programs are not appropriate for cases which ought to result in some form of public sanction or punishment. This is particularly true for cases involving violent</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and repeat offenders, such as in many cases of domestic violence. Societal  and individual interests may be better served by court-sanctioned punishment, such as imprisonment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.4 Not necessarily an instrument to reduce corruption.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is not necessary the case that replacing or supplementing litigation with ADR could reduce corruption. To the extent that a culture of corruption exists, conciliators or arbitrators could fall prey to the same temptations as judges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.5 Not consistent with Rule of Law.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is argued by some critics that the essential attributes of rule of law and due process of law are often not followed in some forms of ADR. While the expansion of ADR has given some an opportunity to resolve their disputes in an inexpensive fashion, some uses of ADR that have proven to be a tool to disenfranchise vulnerable parties In the USA courts occasionally have refused to enforce the results of ADR proceedings that were unfair as to be unconscionable or inconsistent with fundamental due process.<strong><br/></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Conclusion</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After deliberating on the various aspects of arbitration, mediation and other mechanisms and studying the status and performance of the same in various jurisdictions, we have come to the conclusion that the alternative methods of dispute resolution offer a very good opportunity to the parties to get their dispute resolved agreeably but it can also be seen that these alternative methods cannot be employed at all the times. It has to be decided by analyzing the nature of the dispute, the relationship between the parties and the real intention of the parties. Therefore, there is a need to understand and identify the situations where the alternative methods of dispute resolution are more suitable as against the traditional method of litigation and vice versa.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The alternative methods of dispute resolution are not likely to be successful in cases where either of the parties wants the dispute to set a precedent; either of the parties seeks an injunctive relief over the other, the parties have been involved in litigation, where the dispute involves unsettled legal issues etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Alternative methods of dispute resolution are however, a more potent alternative as against traditional litigation where the parties have an ongoing business relationship, the parties have a similar market size, where the dispute is factual or deals with settled legal issues, there the dispute would be publicly embarrassing or could be misused, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, it would be appropriate to conclude that since it is an, alternative dispute resolution mechanism; it might be a good idea to keep it as an „alternative to litigation rather than generalizing one or the other.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BIBLIOGRAPHY<br/></span></strong></p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li>Ahmed,Tahmina and Md.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Termination of the relationship between a Principal and an Agent-<i>– explain and evaluate the statements in the parlance of the Law of Contract, 1872</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Introduction:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The topic statement is about the termination of relationship between a Principal and an Agent. It is discussed under Law of Contract, 1872 by section 208 stating, “<i>When termination of Agent’s authority takes effect as to Agent, and as to third persons – The termination of the authority of an Agent does not, so far as regards the Agent, take effect before it becomes known to him, or, so far as regards third persons, before it becomes known to them.”</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to this act, an Agent may not be held liable for entering into a contract on behalf of a Principal before knowing about revocation of authority, although his authority is revoked. Even if a third party related to the contract is unaware of the revocation, although the Agent is aware, the contract between the Principal and the third party is good.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, the termination of a Principal and an Agent relationship is valid when the Agent acknowledges about the revocation of authority. Furthermore, the Principal is in safer position when the third party is informed regarding termination of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Key concepts:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. </b><strong>Agency</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The relationship between a Principal and an Agent is called Agency. By section 182, <i>“An `Agent’ is a person employed to do any act for another or to represent another in dealings with third persons.”</i> Principal is <i>another</i> person of previous definition who employs the Agent. Agency is formed by mutual consent through an express agreement. This consent is indifferent of formality and documentation except the case of Power of Attorney. Here, the Agent has the power of making a contract in the form of a deed on behalf of his Principal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Agency is formed in three basic ways: (a) consent (express, implied, and retrospective / ratification); (b) operation of law; and (c) estoppel.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. </b><strong>Agent’s contracts</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">By section 226, <i>“Contracts entered into through an Agent, and obligations arising from acts done by an Agent, may be enforced in the same manner and will have the same legal consequences, as if the contracts had been entered into and the acts done by the Principal in person.”</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This section implies with a legal maxim <i>‘Quit facit per alium facit <em>per se’ meaning </em></i>– <i>“He who does through another does by himself.”</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>c. </b><strong>Enforcement and consequences</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An Agency is created with a view to appoint certain instructions and authorities to an Agent within the scope of his instruction to form contractual relationship with the Principal and a third party. If the Agent acts according to or within the scope of the instructions given by the Principal, then the Principal is responsible for every consequence. The Principal is free of this binding when the Agency relationship is formally dissolved which involves the acknowledgement of the Agent and third party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here, the Principal also have the authority over the Agent to bind by acts on his behalf. Without this power of the Principal an Agency does not exist.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Analysis:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. </b><strong>Termination of Agency</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Termination of Agency is possible at any time. If trust is breached or is in question, then it is completely illogical to keep the relationship intact. Here, the Agency is dissolved by giving notice. In some cases, the court orders the Agency to come to an end.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ways in which an Agency may come to an end are presented in section 201 to 210 under Law of Contract 1872.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 201. Termination of Agency –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under this section an Agency can be terminated in following ways:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) the Principal can revoke his authority, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) the Agent can renounce Agency business, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iii) completing the business of the Agency, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iv) Either the Principal or the Agent dies or becomes unsound mind person, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">v) The Principal is adjudicated an insolvent by the court under any act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 202. Termination of Agency, where Agent has an interest in subject-matter –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the Agency subject-matter is formed of a property where the Agent has an interest, then termination requires an express contract which does not involve the prejudice to his interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 203. When Principal may revoke Agent’s authority –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Principal has the power to revoke the Agent’s authority before the Agent exercises the authority given to him that binds the Principal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 204. Revocation where authority has been partly exercised –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Principal does not have the power to revoke the authority of the Agent after he has exercised his authority partly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 205. Compensation for revocation by Principal, or renunciation by Agent –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In an Agency having an express or implied contract with a continuing period of time, revocation or renunciation of the Agency not including sufficient cause, the Principal must compensate the Agent, or the Agent does to the Principal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 206. Notice of revocation or renunciation –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Such revocation or renunciation must include sufficient cause to the party. Else, the damage received from the termination must be made good by revocation or renunciation party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 207. Revocation and Renunciation may be expressed or implied –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Express revocation or renunciation is valid as well as the implied one, where the conduct of either the Principal or the Agent implies termination of Agency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 208. When termination of Agent’s authority takes effect as to Agent, and as to third persons –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revocation by the Principal does not take effect regarding the Agent until he knows about it. The same happens regarding the third party as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 209. Agent’s duty on termination of Agency by Principal’s death or insanity –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Termination of Agency through death or insanity of the Principal binds the Agent to take necessary steps to protect and preserve the interest entrusted to him on behalf of the late Principal’s representatives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 210. Termination of Sub-Agent’s authority –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If an Agent’s authority is terminated, then his sub-Agent’s authority is considered terminated as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These sections indicate two basic ways of termination of Agency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An Agency may be terminated by <em>ac: of parties or by operation of </em>law The different possible circumstances leading to the termination of Agency are enumerated below.-Sections 201-210.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. </b><strong>Termination by act of parties</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The following acts of the parties of an Agency terminate Agency relationship.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) if the Agency is formed for a particular transaction or a particular time period, the Agency is automatically terminated when the transaction or the time period expires.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Either party has the option to give a reasonable notice to the other party to terminate the Agency. When the Principal gives the notice the termination process is called revocation and in the Agent’s case it is called renunciation. If the Agency is terminated by revocation or renunciation without sufficient cause, then the harmed party from termination must be compensated by the other party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mutual agreement from both parties also terminates the Agency. But, in some cases, there are some other agencies which are irrevocable. These agencies are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) ‘authority coupled with an interest’ is employed to the Agent and purpose of the Agency is to protect the Agent’s interest. Here, the Agent does not possess the power of withdrawing authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(ii) the Agent’s authority has taken effect by partial performance and incurrence of liability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(iii) the Agency is declared irrevocable by statute. It happens when the Agent is a power of attorney for a limited period expressed to be irrevocable, or when it is formed under the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>c. </b><strong>Termination by operation of Law</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If any of the following incidents occurs, an Agency is terminated by court orders (except for irrevocable agencies).</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) death of Principal or Agent,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) insanity of Principal or Agent,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) bankruptcy of the Principal, as well as bankruptcy of the Agent when he becomes incapable to perform his duties, and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) frustration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Proper termination:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When an Agency is terminated, it affects the Principal and the Agent first. It brings an end to the authority of the Agent regarding entering into contracts and performance on behalf of the Principal. But, a third party entering in a contract with the Agent without knowing about the termination will hold liable the Principal. So, the Principal also have to send notice to related third parties to avoid unlawful activities from the Agent. The notice should carry the actual and constructive information regarding dissolving of the Agency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Still termination of Agency because of <b>Insanity</b> of Principal has produced two conflicting decisions and here the law stays obscure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><b>Case 1: Drew v Nunn 1879</b></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A husband represented his wife to have authority to purchase goods on credit as his Agent when he was sane. When he became insane, his wife continued to act as his Agent and purchased goods from the same supplier on his behalf. When he recovered sanity, he refused to pay for the goods purchased by his wife on his account. He proposed that his insanity (although unknown to the supplier) had terminated his wife’s authority as Agent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Held: </em>Insanity terminated the Agency relationship between husband and wife. but the court esropped the husband from denying that his representation (that the wife was his Agent) was true. So, he had to pay for the good</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><b>Case 2: Yonge v Toynbee 1910.</b></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A client instructed the solicitors to defend an action on behalf of him who later became insane, unknown to the solicitors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Held: the solicitors breached the warranty of authority and they were liable to the plaintiff (the client was not bound by what they had done – yet in Nunns <em>Case </em>he continued to be liable).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Still, a formal power of attorney in tire prescribed form may continue in force even though the Principal becomes insane according to the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985. But the law on informal Agency arrangements cannot be altered by this procedure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. Relevance:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An illustration from <a href="http://www.vakilno1.com">http://www.vakilno1.com</a> regarding the Law of Contract, 1872 section 208, will be helpful regarding our analysis, which states that:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A</em> directs his Agent <em>B</em> to sell goods on behalf of him, and consents to grant <em>B</em> five per cent commission on the price obtained from the sale of the goods. <em>A</em> afterwards by letter, revokes <em>B’s</em> authority. <em>B</em> after the letter is sent, but before he receives it, sells the goods for 100 rupees. The sale is binding on <em>A,</em> and <em>B</em> is entitled to five rupees as his commission.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 201 complies with A’s revocation. A can terminate the Agency by revocation. The Agent does not have an interest on A’s property as well. So, no problem arises here as well (section 202). A also revokes the authority of B before B exercises the authority given to him by A (Section 203). Still, the law says A is not responsible for B’s act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But, <b>Section 208</b> holds A liable for B’s action. Sending notice is not enough to terminate an Agency. The notice must be reached to the Agent. When the Agent receives the notice, the Agency is considered to be terminated. Here, B acted before he received the letter of revocation. So, his action is valid as A’s Agent. A also is liable to pay B the commission he promised.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, the whole scenario is that the Principal terminates Agency relationship with the Agent which was unknown to the Agent. Then, the Agent acts on behalf of the Principal. This act is not invalid because the termination procedure completes when the Agent acknowledges about the termination. Before the Agent receives the revocation, he still has the authority to work on behalf of the Principal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The situation becomes more difficult to handle for the Principal if the Agent partly uses the authority given to him. Here, the Principal cannot even revoke the Agency (Section 204). If an Agency is revoked then the Principal has to show sufficient cause (Section 206). When such act harms the Agent the Principal also has to compensate (Section 205).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. Conclusion:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This study focuses on termination of the relationship between a Principal and an Agent. Although the relationship is a contractual one, its termination sometimes becomes complex. Especially, when revocation or renunciation is involved, both parties have to know that he Agency has been terminated. Only then the authority ends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bibliography: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>1. </i>Law of Contract and Specific Relief(2010) <i>Dr. Avtar Singh,</i>Eastern Book Company Luknow.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>FLEMING’S</p><ol><li>Scope</li><li>These Terms and Conditions apply for hotel accommodation contracts as well as for all other supplies and services provided by the Hotel to the guest.</li><li>Unless expressly recognised in writing by the Hotel, alternative provisions, including those contained in the guest’s or customer’s general terms and conditions, shall not be applicable.</li><li>Conclusion of contract</li><li>A hotel accommodation contract (hereinafter: “contract”) is established when a guest booking inquiry is responded to with a booking confirmation from the Hotel.</li><li>The contractual partners are the Hotel and the guest. If a third party undertakes the booking for the guest, as the customer it, along with the guest, will be liable as joint debtors to the Hotel for all obligations arising from the contract, provided the Hotel has possession of a corresponding declaration from the customer. Irrespective of this, every customer is obliged to pass on to the guest all information relevant to the booking, particularly these Terms and Conditions.</li><li>Sub-contracting or sub-letting of rooms, together with their use for any purposes other than accommodation, require the prior written approval of the Hotel.</li></ol><ul><li>Services, prices, payment</li></ul><ol><li>The Hotel is obliged to avail the rooms that the guest has reserved in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and to provide the agreed services.</li><li>The guest is obliged to pay the current or agreed Hotel prices for the hire of the room and for any other services he has made use of. This also applies to services effected by the guest or customer and expenses incurred by the Hotel vis-a-vis third parties.</li><li>The agreed prices include the statutory rate of VAT. If the period between the conclusion of contract and the arrival of the guest exceeds four months and the statutory rate of VAT or local taxes and charges increase following the conclusion of contract, the Hotel reserves the right to increase the agreed price by an amount equal to that of the increase of the payable VAT or local taxes and charges.</li><li>The Hotel is likewise entitled to change prices if, following the conclusion of contract, the guest requests changes to the number of rooms reserved, the services required of the Hotel or the length of the stay of the guest and the Hotel agrees to these changes.</li><li>The Hotel’s invoices are payable in full immediately upon receipt. The guest will at the very latest be in default of the obligation of payment if he fails to render payment within 30 days following the due date and receipt of invoice; if the guest is a consumer this only applies if special reference is made to the legal consequences on the invoice. If the guest is in default of payment, the Hotel is entitled to charge consumers default interest at the rate of 5 percentage points over the base interest rate. For commercial transactions, the rate of default interest is 8 percentage points above the base interest rate. The Hotel reserves the right to seek a larger amount of damages.</li></ol><p>The Hotel shall charge a fee of € 5.00 for every reminder it sends in respect of outstanding payments.</p><ol start="6"><li>The Hotel is entitled upon conclusion of the contract or subsequently to request a reasonable advance payment or security deposit from the guest. The amount of the advance payment and the due date for its payment may be agreed in writing in the contract. During the stay of the guest in the Hotel, the Hotel is furthermore entitled at any time to request payment for the costs incurred to that time by the guest by issuing an interim invoice and to demand its immediate settlement.</li><li>The guest is only entitled to set off counterclaims against the claims of the Hotel, if these counterclaims are undisputed or have been confirmed by way of a final legal judgement.</li><li>Rescission (withdrawal) by guest from contract, cancellation</li><li>The Hotel grants the guest the right to withdraw from the contract at any time. This is regulated by the following provisions:</li><li>In the event that the guest withdraws the reservation, the Hotel shall have claim to reasonable compensation.</li><li>The Hotel has the choice of charging the guest a flat rate cancellation fee instead of the actual loss involved. The flat rate cancellation fee shall amount to 90% of the contractually agreed price for overnight stays, including or excluding breakfast, 70% of the contractually agreed price for overnight stays with half board, and 60% of the contractually agreed price for overnight stays with full board. The guest is entitled to show that the Hotel has suffered no loss or that its losses are less than those claimed by way of the flat rate compensation fee.</li><li>Insofar as the Hotel charges for its specific loss, the maximum amount of compensation may not exceed the contractually agreed price of the services to be supplied by the Hotel less the value of the costs saved by the Hotel together with the amount that the Hotel acquires through the alternative use of the Hotel’s services.</li><li>The compensation regulations referred to above shall apply if the guest does not show up to claim the room or services he has reserved without the written agreement of the Hotel.</li><li>The Hotel has no claim to compensation if it has granted the guest an option in his contract to withdraw from the contract within a specified time period without any requirement to pay compensation (cancellation without penalty). The date of receipt of the withdrawal notice by the Hotel shall be definitive. The guest must declare his intention to rescind (withdraw) in writing.</li><li>Rescission (withdrawal) by the Hotel</li><li>Provided that the guest has been granted the right to withdraw without penalty pursuant to IV. 3, the Hotel, for its part, is also entitled to withdraw without penalty within this time period if applications from other guests are available for contractually reserved rooms and the guest does not waive his right to withdraw without penalty when contacted by the Hotel.</li><li>The Hotel is also entitled to withdraw from the contract if an advance payment or security deposit as agreed in accordance with III. 6 is not made/provided within a reasonable period of grace granted by the Hotel.</li><li>Furthermore, the Hotel is entitled to withdraw from the contract if there are significant reasons, especially if</li></ol><ul><li>an act of God or other circumstances beyond the control of the Hotel make the fulfilment of the contract impossible;</li><li>rooms are booked under misleading or erroneous information concerning material matters, e.g. relating to the identity of the guest;</li><li>the Hotel has good reasons for supposing that the use of the Hotel’s services could significantly jeopardise the smooth running of the Hotel’s operations, or the safety of Hotel guests or Hotel employees or severely besmirch the public image of the Hotel in a manner beyond the control or scope of the Hotel’s organisation;</li><li>unpermitted sub-contracting or sub-letting of rooms pursuant to II. 3 is undertaken;</li><li>the circumstances described in VI. 3 have occurred;</li><li>the Hotel becomes aware that the financial circumstances of the guest have significantly deteriorated following the conclusion of the contract, particularly if the guest fails to settle outstanding debts to the Hotel or fails to provide an adequate security deposit and therefore the Hotel’s entitlements to payment appear to be in jeopardy;</li><li>the guest issues an application for the commencement of insolvency proceedings in relation to his assets, or ceases making payments;</li><li>insolvency proceedings are commenced in relation to the assets of the guest or said proceedings are denied due to lack of assets or other such reason.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li>The Hotel must promptly inform the guest that it is exercising the right of withdrawal.</li><li>In such cases of withdrawal by the Hotel, the guest will not be entitled to claim for damages.</li><li>Arrival and departure</li><li>The guest has no right to demand the provision of specific rooms, unless the Hotel has confirmed the provisions of particular rooms in writing.</li><li>The reserved rooms shall be available to the guest from 3 pm onwards on the agreed day of arrival. The guest has no right to demand that rooms should be provided earlier.</li><li>The guest should claim reserved rooms no later than by 4 pm on the agreed day of arrival. Unless a later time of arrival has been expressly agreed, after 4 pm the Hotel has the right to assign the room to a different guest; the guest has no right of compensation in this event. The Hotel has a right of rescission in this respect.</li><li>On the agreed day of departure, rooms must be vacated and be at the Hotel’s disposal by 12 noon at the latest. After this time the Hotel may charge the day-time room rate up until 4 pm to compensate it for the additional use of the room and the costs incurred by way of the delayed availability of the room; from 4 pm it may charge 100% of the current full lodging price. The guest is entitled to show that the Hotel sustained no loss or a lesser amount of loss.</li></ol><ul><li>Liability of the Hotel, limitation period</li></ul><ol><li>If any failures or shortcomings arise in relation to the services provided by the Hotel, the Hotel will make every effort to rectify this situation if the guest has made his objections promptly known. If the guest culpably fails to notify the Hotel of the shortcoming, there can be no entitlement to a reduction of the contractually agreed payment.</li><li>The Hotel is liable in accordance with the statutory provisions in relation to death or personal injury as well as for any deceitfully concealed faults and for any contractual guarantees assumed by it.</li><li>For all other damage not encompassed by VII. 2 and caused by the ordinary negligence of the Hotel, its legal representatives or vicarious agents, the Hotel will only be liable if this damage is due to a breach of a fundamental contractual obligation that jeopardises the actual purpose of the contract. In these cases the liability will be limited to foreseeable damage typical for this type of contract.</li><li>The aforementioned limitations of liability apply to all claims for damages irrespective of the legal basis, including claims relating to tortious liability. The aforementioned limitations of liability also apply in case of a guest’s claims for damages against the employees or vicarious agents of the Hotel.</li><li>For items brought into the Hotel, the Hotel is liable to the guest in accordance with the statutory provisions but for not more than € 3,500. With respect to valuables (money, jewellery etc.) this liability is limited to € 800.00. The Hotel recommends that guests store such articles in the Hotel safe. The guest’s entitlements to compensation shall be null and void if he fails to report to the Hotel any loss, destruction or damage immediately after he has become aware of it.</li></ol><ol start="6"><li>In the event that a guest is provided with a parking space in the Hotel garage or car park, this shall not constitute a contract of safekeeping, even if a parking fee is paid. The Hotel has no duty to keep watch. In the event of that a car (and/or its contents) is stolen or damaged while parked/being manoeuvred on the Hotel premises, the Hotel will not be liable unless it, its employees or vicarious agents acted deliberately or in a grossly negligent manner. In such a case, the claim for damages is to be asserted no later than upon leaving the Hotel premises.</li><li>Wake-up calls will be conducted with the greatest of care by the Hotel. Claims for damages are excluded except in connection with deliberate acts or gross negligence.</li><li>Messages, post and packages for guests will be handled with great care. The Hotel will assume responsibility for keeping such items and, upon request and in return for a charge, to forward post and packages for the guest; this also applies to items of lost property, upon inquiry by the guest. After having kept such articles for at least one month, the Hotel is entitled to pass these on to the local lost and found office in return for a reasonable fee.</li><li>The guest’s claims to compensation will become time-barred no later than two years from the time that the guest became aware of the damage event or, irrespective of such knowledge, no later than three years from the time of the said event. This does not apply with respect to liability for death or personal injury or for other damage resulting from any deliberate or grossly negligent breach of duty on the part of the Hotel, a statutory representative or vicarious agent of the Hotel.</li></ol><ul><li>Concluding provisions, Court, Applicable law</li></ul><ol><li>Amendments and additions to this contract must be made in writing.</li><li>The place of performance is the registered address of the Hotel.

9023	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF JUDICIAL TENURE</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Are judges appointed for life time or until retirement age? Are grounds for removal established by law? It is a fundamental principle of judicial independence that judges’ tenure, security, adequate remuneration, conditions of service, pensions and age of retirement should be adequately secured by law ( GA Resolution 40/32 and 40/146, para. 11-12). Those are the minimal requirements for security of tenure. In the majority of States, judges, whether appointed or elected, enjoy guaranteed tenure until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office, where such exists.</p><p><strong>Security of tenure</strong> is intended to protect judges against interference by any external or internal subject (and first of all the appointing authorities) in a discretionary or arbitrary manner. Premature and unjustified termination of a judge’s mandate is a form of improper pressure on the judge himself/herself. To this end, grounds for removal prior the retirement age or the term of office must be based on well-defined circumstances provided for by law, involving: reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders judges unfit to discharge their function; conviction of a serious crime; gross incompetence; or conduct that is manifestly contrary to the independence, impartiality and integrity of the judiciary. For example, proven acts of corruption on the part of a member of the judiciary should be considered as meeting the threshold for removal. The procedures upon which the discipline, suspension or removal of a judge are based should comply with due process of law (UNHRC, 2013, p. 3).</p><p>Accordingly, in many States, “removal of a judge can only be justified where the shortcomings of the judge are so serious as to destroy confidence in the judge’s ability to properly perform the judicial function” (UNODC, 2015, para. 75).</p><p><strong>Salaries and pensions</strong> of judges are important elements to be considered for the protection of judicial independence. It is generally accepted that salaries and pensions must be established by law, and be adequate and commensurate with the <em>status</em>, dignity and responsibilities of judicial office. Adequate remuneration, in fact, contributes to prevent judges from seeking extra profits or favours and better shield them from potential corruptive practices and pressures aimed at influencing their decisions or behaviour (European Charter on the Statute for Judges. Principle 6.1).</p><p>Salaries, conditions of service and pensions of judges should not be altered to their disadvantage after appointment. To this end, “legislative or executive powers that may affect judges in their office, their remuneration, conditions of service or their resources, shall not be used with the object or consequence of threatening or bringing pressure upon a particular judge or judges” (UNODC, 2015, para. 91).</p><div class="bordered-text"><p><strong>Example: Canada<br/></strong></p><p>In the 1990s general economic difficulties caused several Canadian provinces to reduce the salaries of provincial court judges. Some accused persons and one provincial judges’ association argued that these reductions violated the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence. The Canadian Supreme Court was called upon to establish a framework for decision-making on the remuneration of provincial court judges consistent with preserving their financial security.</p><p>The Court made three key findings. First, judicial salaries can be reduced, increased, or frozen, but only with recourse to an independent, effective and objective commission. Governments are prohibited from making decisions with respect to judicial salaries before receiving the commission’s report. Furthermore, governments must formally and promptly respond to the commission’s report, and justify any decision not to accept its recommendations. Second, there are to be no negotiations on judicial remuneration between the judiciary and the executive or legislature. This prohibition is based on the view that such negotiations are inherently political and that they would put the courts in a conflict of interest because the Crown is often a party before them. Moreover, negotiation may lead to a perception among the public that the judiciary is open to any compromise, if the situation requires it. Third, judicial salaries may not fall below a minimum level. While the court did not set a minimum, it explained that if salaries are too low, there is a risk, whether real or perceived, that judges will adjudicate in a certain way in order to secure higher salaries from the executive or legislature or be manipulated by offers of benefits from litigants (Binnie, 2011, p. 23).</p></div><p>Another important question related to tenure and removal is whether – and to what extent – judges enjoy <strong>immunity</strong> from criminal or civil liability. Whereas judges’ criminal liability is a key principle recognized in most States under the criminal laws of general application, civil liability is a more controversial issue. A balance has to be found between the principle of individual independence (a judge must be free to act upon his/her convictions, without fear of personal consequences) and the rights of individuals to compensation from the State for injury incurred by reason of negligence or fraudulent or malicious abuse of authority by a judge.</p><p>Many States, however, “consider it of fundamental importance for a judge to enjoy personal immunity from civil suits for monetary damages for improper acts or omissions made in the exercise of their judicial functions”. In other words, judges personally enjoy absolute freedom from liability with respect to claims made directly against them relating to their exercise of their functions in good faith. In application of this principle, “the remedy for judicial errors, whether with respect to jurisdiction or procedure, in ascertaining or applying the law or in evaluating evidence, lies in an appropriate system of appeals or judicial review. Conversely, civil liability may apply with regard to injury incurred by reason of negligence or misuse of authority by the judge, but the remedy usually lies only against the State without recourse (or with limited recourse) by the State against the judge” (UNODC, 2015, para. 78-80).</p><div class="bordered-text"><p><strong>Key debate</strong></p><p>General principles on civil liability have come under debate in Italy in recent years, following a set of rulings of the European Court of Justice in 2006 and 2011. The European Court specified that a national law cannot exclude, in a general manner, State liability for the infringement of EU law by the judge, by reason that such infringement results from an interpretation of law or an assessment of facts and evidence. The Court pointed out the responsibility of the Italian legislator and called for a reform in the field. The problem was that the Italian law (no. 117/1988) established State liability only in exceptional cases and only if committed with intention or gross negligence. But, more than that, the practice of Italian courts was so tolerant towards the judiciary that it resulted in a systematic dismissal of complaints brought against the Italian State. In other words, the Italian law proved to be completely inefficient in the protection of individual rights and resulted in a sort of absolute immunity of the State (and consequently of the judge) for damage caused by judicial decisions. The European Court did not challenge the traditional judge’s privilege as it considered only State liability and not the personal liability of the judge. The State (and not the judge) must be held responsible for the infringement of EU law by the judge. That was the main point. This has required reforms in some EU Member States, especially where State liability for judicial wrongs was limited to criminal breaches or private activity.</p></div><p><a id="module14-1.2.d" name="module14-1.2.d"></a>Finally, some national constitutions or laws also specify that judges may not hold any other office, whether public or private, except non-remunerated positions in teaching and scientific research in the legal field.</p><p><strong> Financial autonomy and court administration.</strong></p><p>The funding of courts is closely linked to the issue of judicial independence, in that it determines the conditions in which the courts perform their functions. Sufficient resources are essential to ensuring judicial independence from State institutions and private parties, so that the judiciary can perform its duties with independence, integrity and efficiency.</p><p>It is the duty of each State to provide <strong>adequate resources</strong> to enable the judiciary to properly perform its functions. This also includes appointing a sufficient number of judges in relation to caseloads, providing the courts with necessary support staff and equipment (including office automation and data processing facilities), and offering judges appropriate personal security, adequate training, remuneration and emoluments. It is evident that the ability of a State to fully meet the budgetary needs of the judiciary is dependent on its economic and financial position.</p><p>There is an obvious link between the funding of courts and the management of courts. According to some international and regional standards, matters of <strong>courts’ administration</strong> that relate directly to the exercise of judicial function, including for example assignment of judges and assignment of cases to judges, shall primarily vest in the judiciary or in a body subject to its direction and control. An external authority must not be in a position to interfere in matters that are directly and immediately relevant to the adjudicative functions. Nor shall the allocation of cases be influenced by the wishes of a party to the case or anyone otherwise interested in the outcome of the case. Some institutional relations with other authorities are possible, having regards to the limits required by judicial independence ( GA Resolution 40/32 and 40/146, para. 14; Council of Europe, Recommendation on Judges (2010), Chapter III, para. 24, 40 and 41).</p><p>However, the introduction into court systems, in recent decades, of a variety of management principles and practices oriented toward achieving increased productivity, improved case processing and reduced costs (following the so called <strong>new public management</strong> theory), has highlighted the need for a more professional approach to court administration. “Consequently, in many jurisdictions, a court administrator now has authority over all nonjudicial court management and administrative functions. These include long-range administrative planning, finance, budget, procurement, human resources, facilities management, court security, and employee discipline, in addition to judicial support functions. In any case, since the overall functioning of a court depends on the interplay between the judge and administrative staff, there should be a shared responsibility between the head of the court and the court administrator for the overall management of the court” (UNODC, 2015, para. 99).</p><p>To to improve courts’ efficiency, some States have established specific independent agencies called Courts services. They are composed of judges, representatives of the courts’ staff, members of the Bar, experts in the field of management and finance and, sometimes, the Minister of Justice. They are generally entrusted with far reaching powers in the area of court administration and court management; they are often involved in setting the budget of the justice system, monitoring expenditures, promoting automation, elaborating criteria for evaluating the overall performance of the courts; they also manage – to varying degrees – judicial personnel (training, role assignment, evaluation and promotions) to safeguard judicial independence. Court services have spread, for example, over Northern Europe and in particular in Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Estonia.</p><p>Court services usually act as intermediate bodies between the courts and the Government. Their purpose is to improve efficiency while safeguarding judicial independence. If managerial duties are exercised by the courts through their ‘own’ Court service, there is a fair chance to increase the courts’ responsibility for their own results and to improve efficiency. Court Services usually draft annual reports about their activities.</p><p>The main challenge many countries are now confronting is how to balance the new requirements of public management with the accurate exercise of judicial activity. An excessive focus on efficiency targets, productivity, cost control, statistics and quality control policies as main priorities to improve the functioning of courts can have negative consequences.</p><p>In some countries, for example, the appeal and reversal rate is used for the professional evaluation of first instance courts’ judges. This may create a pressure on judges, in the sense that their decision-making might be more oriented to please the courts of appeal rather than to impartially apply the law. Such mechanisms, encouraging potential conformism within the judiciary, can be detrimental to judicial independence. Quality policies too much oriented towards productivity and efficiency targets can have detrimental effects on other important values (such as independence) that are of paramount importance for the correct functioning of the courts.</p><p>Another important question that has gained greater importance in the last years is <strong>transparency</strong> of courts. Offering full and understandable information about court procedures can enhance legal culture, access to justice and public trust in the judiciary. Transparent procedures, in fact, can improve the citizens’ knowledge of the legal remedies offered by the court system, of the basic procedural rights of the parties (such as the right to appeal against a judgment), and of the role of the different actors in the judicial process (lawyers, judges, prosecutors, etc.).</p><p>Transparency also implies <strong>free access to judicial decision</strong>. A reasonable number of judgments should be made available to the general public. In most countries, judgments are regularly published in data bases open to the public or to professionals (but also in court bulletins, websites, collections of judgments, legal commentaries, etc.). Usually they are anonymized to safeguard the privacy of the parties and the other subjects involved in the case, as well as the protection of confidential information and data. “Privacy policies actually differ from one country to another: in some countries judgments are released only to the parties to a case and their lawyers; in others, expansive privacy laws and a traditional reluctance to provide open access to court information, limit access. A situation that is potentially worse is that some countries have no policy at all on the publication of judgments and the dissemination of court information” (UNODC, 2011, p. 99 and 100). In very general terms, public scrutiny can lead to a better quality of judicial decisions. Potential criticism of judicial decisions by the media, academia or even politicians does not infringe judicial independence but rather contributes to open justice and public debate.</p><p>Transparency may also imply: granting physical access to court sessions and/or court hearings (according to the requirements prescribed by law); offering assistance in starting proceedings (through standard forms and blanks, etc.); facilitating communication with lawyers and attorneys, granting the inspection of records, protocols of court sessions etc.; inviting journalists to press conferences and releases about judicial decisions and pending trials, especially those having public relevance; organizing conferences and seminars involving judges, representatives of society, of the business community, etc.; adopting other proactive measures and strategies to improve the interaction between judges and the community they serve (in some countries, for example, court user guides provide basic information on criminal and civil procedures. They help to actively engage a court in a relationship with the community, and to demystify many of the complexities surrounding the operation of a legal system) (UNODC, 2011, p. 99, 100; UNODC, 2015).</p><p><a id="module14-1.2.e" name="module14-1.2.e"></a>Finally, increased transparency also contributes to the integrity and efficiency of the justice system and reduces opportunities for corruption.</p><p><strong> Judicial conduct and discipline</strong></p><p>Judicial conduct and discipline have been subjects of particular attention in recent decades. In many judicial systems standards of judicial conduct have been introduced to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. The observance by the judiciary of rules of conduct, and disciplinary measures for those who transgress these rules, are conditions to guarantee an independent judiciary (Lord Justice Thomas, 2007). Judicial conduct also affects the level of confidence of the general public in the courts: since the exercise of judicial power “has dramatic effects upon lives and fortunes” of the people involved, citizens “will not wish such power to be reposed in anyone whose honesty, ability or personal standards are questionable” (Lord Justice Thomas, 2008). Accordingly, standards of judicial conduct serve to both safeguard the independence of judges and to guarantee their ‘quality’.</p><p>Judicial conduct and discipline are obviously connected with other aspects of judicial governance. The greater or lesser role of judicial discipline is, generally speaking, related to the system of judicial recruitment, the quality of initial and continuing education, and the thoroughness of periodic professional evaluations (where they exist). For example, the role of judicial discipline becomes more significant in countries that recruit magistrates from the ranks of young law graduates without previous professional experience (civil law countries), rather than in countries were judges are recruited from among lawyers well known for their professional experience (common law countries).</p><p>In some countries, judges are disciplined on the basis of rules formulated in rather vague terms, sometimes applicable to public servants in general. Such disciplinary systems have been the object of criticism, for several reasons, including the fact that they leave great room for discretion. The <strong>wide discretion</strong> of disciplinary authorities in applying norms formulated in vague terms could be a threat to judicial independence, insofar as the norms could be misused to sanction judges for their judicial orientations.</p><div class="bordered-text"><p><strong>Example: Italy</strong></p><p>In Italy, until 2006, judicial discipline had been based on a vague provision that allowed the Disciplinary Commission of the Superior Council of the Magistracy the discretion to decide when and how judicial misconduct should be punished. According to that provision, disciplinary penalties could be imposed on magistrates who “fail to accomplish their duties and conduct themselves, either in or outside the office, in a way that makes them unworthy of the trust and consideration they must enjoy, or when they compromise the prestige of the judiciary”. As this provision was so general, judicial misconduct had been <em>de facto</em> defined by the Disciplinary Commission case law. As it was not clear (to magistrates, or to the general public) what violations a magistrate might be called to account for, any behaviour could potentially be investigated.</p><p>In 2006, Italy enacted a new law comprising not only a detailed list of disciplinary violations, on and off the bench, but also indicating the kind of sanctions to be imposed for each of those violations.</p></div><p>In other countries judicial discipline is – in various way – based on established codes or guidelines for judicial conduct. <strong>Codes of conduct</strong> have been adopted by many countries throughout the world. Codes should be considered living documents and be reviewed periodically in light of emergent ethical challenges and the efficacy of the codes in addressing those challenges (UNODC, 2011, p. 134). A significant role in promoting the adoption of codes of judicial conduct has been played by model codes elaborated at the international level like the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct (2002) and the Latin American Code of Judicial Ethics. They identify the basic values of the judicial role such as: independence, impartiality, integrity, propriety, equality, competence and diligence.</p><p>There are significant differences among the various codes, including the specificity with which principles of ethics or judicial conduct are spelled out and whether or not they are enforced by means of disciplinary proceedings. Codes for judicial conduct have important effects on the protection of judicial independence, both if they have only exhortative nature and if they contain more detailed and binding prescriptions. They are usually self-regulatory provisions generated by the judiciary itself (or its representative organs) or with its contribution.</p><p>Codes for judicial conduct are important tools not only for judicial training but also to build up a professional culture, to improve the excellence of the judicial profession and the public confidence in the administration of justice, to offer assistance on issues concerning judicial conduct, and <em>to encourage judges to reflect on problems that may arise in their professional and extra-professional lives.</em></p><p>Some countries have adopted codes or guidelines which are not enforceable as such, since these are only exhortative in nature. Such codes indicate, in general terms, the behaviour expected of judges, and elaborate the best way of performing judicial functions. The common feature of these provisions is that they are not disciplinarily binding, but they consist of ethical rules, suggestions, advice, recommendations, principles, whose violation cannot <em>per se</em> give rise to a disciplinary action. As they are not prescriptive, the primary responsibility for deciding whether a particular activity or conduct is appropriate or not rests with the individual judge. The consultative process of developing such Codes is an important part of their acceptance by judges.</p><div class="bordered-text"><p><strong>Examples: England and Wales; the Philippines<br/></strong></p><p>In <strong>England and Wales</strong>, following extensive consultation with the judiciary, a Guide to judicial conduct was drafted in 2004 by a working group of judges set up by the Judges’ Council. It is intended “to offer assistance to judges on issues, rather than to prescribe a detailed code, and to set up principles from which judges can make their own decisions and so maintain their judicial independence” (High Council, 2008). One of the Guide’s most important features is flexibility, as the responsibility and the public perception of the standards to which judges should adhere are continuously evolving. For this reason, after the publication of the Guide the Judges’ Council set up a Standing Committee charged to keep the Guide under review, to deal with any points of principle that may not be considered in the Guide or may need revision, and to consider how the Guide is working in practice. A need for change may be perceived by judges whether or not a specific problem has actually arisen.</p><p>In <strong>the Philippines</strong>, the University of the Philippines Institute for Judicial Administration launched the publication of the New Code of Judicial Code of Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary (2004). Based on the Bangalore Principles, local experts wrote the annotations to the six canons providing local case law to support the implementation of the code, with the help of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals Judge in editing and final remarks. The 2007 annotation offers a practical guide for judges that uses case law to explain the various provisions of the Code.</p></div><p>Other countries have opted for a different solution and have introduced detailed disciplinary rules (Disciplinary Codes) that are binding for judges. These rules are primarily intended to reduce discretionary powers in the exercise of disciplinary control. They are, however, less flexible tools, sometimes approved by law. Detailed disciplinary binding rules can better contribute to guaranteeing judicial independence from at least two perspectives: avoiding the disciplining of magistrates for vague, discretionary reasons and without knowing <em>ex ante</em> what is considered a violation and the penalties they can incur; improving the transparency and the effectiveness of disciplinary proceedings, by reducing the discretionary powers of disciplinary authorities.</p><p>A common topic concerning judicial conduct is freedom of expression. Can freedom of expression or the use of social media impair the independence of the judiciary? Freedom of expression is a delicate question for the judiciary, because judges must not only be independent and impartial but also appear as such. Inappropriate declarations can easily impair the image of judicial independence, in the view of the general public. For this reason, it is important that judges be extremely careful and exercise self-restraint in the relationship with the media and in the use of other means of communication.</p><div class="bordered-text"><p><strong>Key debate</strong></p><p>As a general rule, “members of the judiciary are like other citizens entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly; provided, however, that in exercising such rights, judges shall always conduct themselves in such a manner as to preserve the dignity of their office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary” ( GA Resolution 40/32 and 40/146, para. 8). Judges are also bound by professional secrecy with regard to their deliberations and to confidential information; the right to information about judicial matters of public interest should be exercised having regard to the limits imposed by judicial independence.</p><p>To prevent judges from being directly engaged with the media, “a successful approach in many countries has involved establishing press and communication offices or court’s spokespersons under the responsibility of the courts to facilitate media coverage of judicial proceedings. These offices liaise with media representatives, respond to and manage requests from journalists, issue press releases and generally provide accurate information about judicial decisions and legal issues. These offices can also provide schedules of upcoming cases, monitor the media for accurate reporting, and design media campaigns that promote public understanding of the judiciary” (UNODC, 2015, para. 135).</p><p>In addition to such measures, “the training of journalists organized by, or in cooperation with, the courts can help reduce ineffective reporting. Such training provides them with basic knowledge about court procedures and legal issues, and thus contribute to improving journalistic skills and ethics, and building trust between judges and journalists” (UNODC, 2015, para. 134).</p></div><p>Through the Global Judicial Integrity Network, which is a component of the Global Programme for the Implementation of the Doha Declaration, UNODC has brought together judges from around the world, to explore the challenges and opportunities that social media platforms present for judicial practice. Judges have shared the following insights on the complexities of judicial practice in the age of social media:</p><p>“If we are moving forward, it is obvious that guidance and training are required in order to avoid the pitfalls. The Bangalore Principles may have been developed before social media, but whatever is seen to be unbecoming conduct can still be interpreted in the world of social media. We are not going to invent new standards; they are the same standards, now digitized,” Judge Kashim Zannah, Chief Judge of the Borno State, Nigeria, and Member of the Advisory Board of the Global Judicial Integrity Network.</p><p>Judge Cristi Danilet, Appeals Court in Romania, who has over 60,000 followers on his Facebook account, believes that it is acceptable to communicate with a wider circle, as long as judges followed the same criteria. “Citizens want to see more professional aspects when they look for a judge online. They are not interested in my family, but in me as an expert on law. It’s good to have a code of conduct, but at the same time we should respect all the rules we already have offline.”</p><p>Judge Virginia Kendall, United States District Court, is both a strong proponent of training and an active trainer herself of judges and judicial staff: “It is not intuitive, and you need to train judges on their own code of conduct. The insidious nature of social media includes that it stays forever.” She advises demonstrating to judges how to use various actual social platforms (for example, showing how to tweet, how to like, or how to comment), in addition to how posts can be copied, altered or reposted.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>In this essay I will explore the provisions introduced by the Terrorism Act 2006 and assess whether these pose risks which may overshadow any security benefit. As the main critiques of this legislation focus on the section 1 offence of encouragement of terrorism and the section 23 extended detention period for terrorist suspects, these two provision shall be the subject of this essay. I will demonstrate that the provisions of extended detention and the encouragement of terrorism raise issues with regard to freedom of speech and breaches of various ???. I will show how the implementation of previous terrorism provisions have broken the trust between minority, especially Muslim communities and the British Government. These new provisions may pose to further alienate these communities, the very communities with whom a flow of information is vital to reduce the risk of terrorism.</p><p>The Terrorism Act 2006 did not pass with ease and human rights and civil liberties groups were the most vocalised opponents (Parker, 2007, p. 749)</p><p>The most controversial aspect of the Act was the proposed increase in the detention period for suspects without charge from 14 days to 90 days. The government argued that police and intelligence services required the extension due to the complexities of modern terrorism and the evidence gathering process (Hewitt, 2008, p. 54), however MP’s from all parties remained unconvinced and rejected the plan, accepting a 28 days period instead. The normal detention period without charge in the UK for committing a criminal offence such as murder is 4 days and for a terrorism offence this is 7 times longer. Can this really be justified?</p><p>In support of this compromise the Select Committee on Home Affairs stated that although ‘current and recent investigations have gone sufficiently close to 14 days to show that an extension… is justified’ ‘none of the evidence… would have justified a maximum detention period longer than 28 days'(select committee:para34/35 conclusion).</p><p>Concerns have however been raised. Although the civil liberties and human rights group, Liberty, welcomed the acceptance that provision needed to be made to ensure the health and well-being of suspects in detention, they expressed concern over the psychological effects and the danger of those who are detained to make false confessions as they may perceive that the short-term benefits outweigh the long term consequences (Liberty:para12). Amnesty International agree with this claim (amnesty international: 45) and it is possible that these confessions may be deemed inadmissible by any court, making the extended pre-charge detention worthless. Amnesty International also draw our attention to the international treaties which require the UK to charge promptly, all people detained in connection with a criminal offence and that they are tried within a reasonable time (Amnesty international: 45) ,therefore the extended detention may be in breach of these treaties. On the other hand the need for detention is always validated by the judiciary as any detention past the first 48 hrs must be authorised by a judicial authority.</p><p>Article 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights requires states to prohibit any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence and Article 5 of the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism requires member states to criminalise the unlawful and intentional public provocation to commit a terrorist offence. The Government implemented these through section 1 of the 2006 Act however this has also been highly criticised. This provision ‘applies to a statement that is likely to be understood by some or all of the members of the public to whom it is published as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to them to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism or convention offences’.</p><p>As this implements the definition of Terrorism provided in the Terrorism Act 2000, ‘terrorism’ covers the use or threat of action which satisfies three conditions (1) the action involves serious violence against a person or serious damage to property, endangers a person’s life (other than the person committing the action), creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system; (2) the use or threat of action is designed to influence the government or an intergovernmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public; and (3) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. Using this definition, the UK offence is much wider than the required ‘terrorist offences’ and this has been criticised by the Council of Europe for carrying a ‘considerable risk of incompatibility with the right to freedom of expression in Article 10 ECHR’ (pg 14). This definition is also over encompassing as the 2000 Act deals with actual terrorist acts however the 2006 Act applies to statements regarding such terrorist acts and an additional definition should have been provided. The Mayor of London has argued that as the ‘definition of terrorism is broad enough to encompass almost any form of legitimate protest… the Government may use it as a political tool on whomever it chooses’ (JCHR from Ellen p751).</p><p>It has been argued that ‘existing prohibitions on incitement to violence, and other similar crimes, already presented the authorities with the tools to address the sorts of dangerous speech’ (Hunt, 2007) the Government were targeting. Britain has previously convicted, Sheik Faisal, an Islamic minister who encouraged young Muslim men to wage war against those who do not follow the Islamic faith, for soliciting murder under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and racial hatred under the Public Order Act 1986 (R v El-Faisal). The notorious Abu Hamza al-Masri has also been convicted under the same two Acts for glorifying and encouraging terrorism. Although neither of these men actually committed any violent acts, pre-existing laws allowed his conviction for speech encouraging terrorism.</p><p>Whether ‘an organisation that advocates for an independent Palestinian State, and vocally supports resistance where non-violent means for achieving a just arrangement have failed’ (Chong &amp; Sentas, 2006, p. 8) falls within indirectly encouraging is of course open to interpretation as adopting the literal approach to construction it would be, however only the criminal justice system can decide this in the future. This uncertainty may also have an effect on ‘Muslim community groups who wish to express their solidarity with the Muslims who live under oppressive regimes or… occupying forces’ (Chong &amp; Sentas, 2006, p. 8).</p><p>Subsection 3 enables the indirect encouragement of terrorism to include a statement which ‘glorifies the commission of preparation’ of terrorist acts if from this statement ‘members of the public could reasonably be expected to infer that what is being glorified is being glorified as conduct that should be emulated by them’ even though the ??? have recommended that vague terms such as glorifying or promoting terrorism should not be used when restricting expression (short, 43). The House of Lords previously twice rejected this provision and Walker (2006) draws our attention to the ‘furious debates about whether this offence might criminalise anyone who glorified the armed opposition to the Apartheid regime of South Africa’ and provides the example of Nelson Mandela (Walker, 2006, p. 1140), would people really regard him as a terrorist? Many major Muslim groups regard Hamas and Hizbollah as ‘legitimate resistance fighters’ (Spalek &amp; Lambert, 2007, p. 265) and this legislation may place members of these groups in the same faction as terrorists.</p><p>The European Court of Human Rights in the case of Karatas v Turkey held that a general prohibition of glorification of violence cannot be justified and only those statements said to actually incite violence may be prohibited. In this case the complainant had been convicted for publishing poetry that glorified acts of terrorism. The Court accepted that violent terrorist attacks occurred regularly in Turkey however even in this context the conviction constituted a violation of the right to freedom of expression. This casts great doubt on whether this prohibition is in accordance with Human Rights.</p><p>Section 4 explains that ‘how a statement is likely to be understood’ and ‘what members of the public could reasonably be expected to infer from it’ should be determined by looking at both the ‘content of the statement as a whole’ and the ‘circumstances and manner of it publication’ however the Islamic Human Rights Commission as claimed that ‘certain statements made by Muslims will be regarded as “glorification” due to its delivery to a Muslim audience; similar comments made by members of other communities will not be held to the same standard” (from Assessing damage 130). A possible example of this is seen in calls for Cherie Booth, wife of Tony Blair, to be prosecuted for stating that ‘in view of illegal occupation of Palestinian land I can well understand how decent Palestinians become terrorists’ (Walker, 2006, p. 1140) and some people may even have see George Bush and Tony Blair praising the actions of the coalitions troops in Iraq as the glorification of terrorism (MAKING BAD LAW WORSE) if they are opposed to the occupying coalition forces.</p><p>It has been argued that ‘vague definitions of crimes are in violation of international provisions which require that individuals should be able to foresee whether behaviour is criminal or not’ (Jurists International Commission of, 2009, p. 129) however the Government have justified their implementation by arguing that they were merely ratifying the Council of Europe Convention. The offence of indirect encouragement by glorification has however failed to integrate the requirement of intent to incite as this offence can be committed irrespective of the intent of the author (Jurists International Commission of, 2009, p. 129/130). The council of Europe have also made this disapproval (council download, 17). This leads to the criticism that ‘these offences run the danger of penalising equivocal actions… (and) leave room for claims of people being victimised for their views or even their stupid curiosity’ (Walker, 2006, p. 1143). Amnesty International believes that this offence may lead to violations to the right to freedom of expression, allowing the criminalisation of citizens for holding opinions. (Amnesty international: 43). I would agree with the International Commission of Juries that ‘it is clear that speech and other forms of expression can incite terrorism, and that it is legitimate to criminalise such activities. Any limitation must, however, respect international law and not limit forms of expression that are merely controversial’ (International Commission of Juries, 2009 p.127). Muslims may avoid talking about terrorist events and political events over seas such as Palestine, Iraq or Afghanistan for fear of falling foul of this legislation. There is concern that such wide ranging laws such as the glorification reduce legitimate political debate, particularly within immigrant and minority communities (Jurists International Commission of, 2009, p. 130). The Government insist that targeting a particular community was neither their intention, nor the result of the “new” offences’ (Jurists International Commission of, 2009, p. 130) however ‘British public officials, members of Parliament… opponents and proponents… have made speeches and comments that clarify terrorist speech by radical Muslims as the target of the 2006 Act’ (Parker, 2007, p. 722) and rejected provision from the Terrorism Bill such as the suggestion that radical mosques be closed provide strong evidence that singling out the Muslim Community was in fact the aim of the legislation.</p><p>The notion of ‘community’ is a significant feature of modern criminal justice policy and since coming to power Gordon Brown has modified his language ‘to encourage a “strong consensual approach” to all of Britain’s communities’ (Parker, 2007, p. 732) . The national policing plan 2005-2008 states that the ‘counter-terrorism strategy… is underpinned by strong intelligence processes … and strong communities to build and increase trust and confidence within minority faith communities’ and anti-terror measures actively encourage surveillance within communities with the ‘responsible Muslim citizen expected to work with the authorities to help reduce the risk of terrorism’ (Spalek &amp; Lambert, 2007, p. 258). The representative of the Mayor of London claims that ‘preventing terrorist attacks, relies heavily on intelligence, which can only come from our communities… law that criminalise non-violent behaviour and groups, perceived as unfairly targeting Muslims and stifling legitimate debate, will lead to a breakdown in trust, resulting in a reduced flow of information’ (from assessing damage 130).</p><p>This breakdown in trust is already evident due to tools previously implemented by Terrorism Legislation. Figures show that Stop and Search powers introduced by the Terrorism Act 2000 have been used disproportionately against people of an Asian descent (Mythen, Walklate, &amp; Khan, 2009, p. 738) and in fact the Metropolitan Police gave evidence to the parliamentary Home Affairs Committee that these powers had ‘created deeper racial and ethnic tensions against the Police’ (Mythen, Walklate, &amp; Khan, 2009, p. 739) and have ‘trampled on the basic human rights of too many Londoners… (cutting) off valuable sources of community information and intelligence’ (Mythen, Walklate, &amp; Khan, 2009, p. 739). The case of Walter Wolfgang, an 82 year old who fled to Britain as a Jewish refugee from the Nazis and became a peace activist and Labour party member is often cited as a key example of measures which have encroached fundamental rights. During the Labour Party Conference 2005, Mr Wolfgang shouted the word ‘nonsense’ during the Foreign Secretary’s speech about British policy in Iraq and was detained under s.44, Terrorism Act 2000. This illustrates how legislation places limitations upon legitimate expressions of dissent, indeed political dissent which we should all be free to express.</p><p>After the introduction of multiple pieces of anti-terrorism legislation, surrounded by the media and political circles focusing upon security from the terrorist threat and often linking this threat with “foreigners” and “Muslim extremists” (amnesty international: 46), Muslims and other minority communities have experienced increasing racism. ‘These discourses have invariably defined British Muslims en bloc as a risky, suspect population, raising the intensity of scrutiny on Muslims… and potentially exacerbating the degree of public suspicion directed towards young male Muslims’ (Mythen, Walklate, &amp; Khan, 2009, p. 740). Muslim minorities, in particular young Muslim men, have been viewed as a ‘problem group’ (Alexander cited in Spalek and lambert:261) by the media, politicians, the security services and other agencies in the criminal justice system. Hazel Blears, the Minister for Counter Terrorism, has even warned that the Muslim community must face up to the fact that police would target them because of the threat from people ‘associated with an extreme form of Islam’ (From amnesty international: 46), however this statement contradicts the Governments previous statement that they never intended to target a particular community.</p><p><strong>Something About Further Alienation</strong></p><p>The UK has a long history of Terrorism Law and the Terrorism Act 2000 was intended as a permanent and comprehensive piece of legislation, created with the aim of breaking away from the use of emergency legislation, however in the aftermath of the 9/11 and 7/7 bombings and other attempted attacks, terrorism has become a key policy priority. The implementation of Terrorism legislation in 2001, 2005 and 2006 shows that this aim has not been successful and politicians continue to assume that the public are impressed by reactive legislation (Walker, 2006, p. 1140). For centuries, Britain prided itself in its tradition of welcoming those who felt oppressed by their native lands (londonistan article) however the provisions implemented by terrorism legislation are in danger of dividing these communities. There was previously a disproportionate focus on the Muslim Community by the media, Criminal Justice System and intelligence agencies and the provisions introduced through this legislation may create the clearly undesirable, counter-productive result of further alienating minority communities so that they are less likely to assist in effective investigations. I have demonstrated that previous terrorism legislation has contributed to Muslims and other minority communities feeling socially excluded and disproportionately targeted. From the events of 7th July we can see that the UK has a home grown terrorist problem and that ‘young Muslim men are willing to turn their backs on the country in which they were born and commit heinous acts of terrorism’ (Parker, 2007, p. 731) however we must remember that ‘Muslims were amongst the casualties in the atrocities of 7th July, and the authorities cannot combat terrorism without the confidence and trust of Muslims’ (select committee: para 38). The extended detention and encouragement provision have the potential to further alienate Muslims, resulting in the radical Islamic factions going ‘under ground’ as there the flow of information from these communities is further constricted.</p><p>In the case of A v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Lord Hoffman stated that ‘the real threat to the life of the nation… comes not from terrorism but laws such as these’ (United Kingdom House of Lords Reports, 2004). This signals that the greatest challenge may be maintaining the trust of the public by embracing multi-cultural values alongside a legal system which enables citizens to live a life safe from violence but which also values human rights.</p><p>These provisions do not however only effect Muslims and the limitation placed upon fundamental rights …</p><p>Freedom of speech: we may question whether the glorification clause should have remained but also whether the new offence of indirect encouragement was at all necessary considering that the United Kingdom already have the offence of incitement to murder and the recently added offence of incitement to Terrorism created under the Terrorism Act 2000.</p><p>I have demonstrated how these provisions severely limit free speech and expression and may be in breach of ‘Terrorism policies have created an “us and them” approach and have alienated those groups whose support is essential for the success of counter terrorism action’. (Arnold, 2009, p. 14).</p><p>Further breaches may occur as the Select committee: longer may be needed in the future.</p><p><strong>Article 19</strong></p><p>Still, although it remains virtually unused thus far, the 2006 Act remains a viable tool for British law enforcement authorities to begin using at their discretion.</p><p>1.6 Million Muslims, 3.1% of the population, is second most popular religion. (MCB website stats)</p><p>Lord Carlile, known for his support of civil liberties, and an unlikely supported of such legislation has stated that the introduction of the Encouragement to Terrorism offence is proportional to the threat addressed (Parker, 2007, p. 746)</p><p>(R v El-Faisal) [2004] EWCA (Crim) 456</p></div></div>
9027	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">TERRORISM AND COUNTER TERRORISM IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY LAW</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Terrorism has a direct and significant effect on international security, the consequences of which are devastating on peoples enjoyment of their basic human rights including their right to life, fair treatment of victims and liberty. In addition, acts of terrorism are costly to the stability of governments, destabilize efforts of civil societies, threaten peace and security, and hinder economic growth and development. As far as most governments are concerned, the security of their citizens is a basic human right hence they do whatever they can in order to protect individuals accordingly. This paper researches on terrorism and counter-terrorism in the context of international security law. It puts the real scenario of how perpetrators of terrorism and State agencies act with regard to fundamental aspects of international security law.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Terrorism is a very complex and demanding phenomenon to address. In as much as acts of terrorism are strongly condemned by the international community, efforts to address this phenomenon have been stained by differences in opinions together with competing concerns. Various key issues lie unsettled and the quest for solutions has become even more complicated due to the emergence of new forms of terrorism. The international community remains challenged on how to translate the statements of international humanitarian law and well-elaborated declarations of international security law on the condemnation of terrorism into tangible measures (in form of legal, political, and military) that can successfully mitigate the very harmful effects and ramifications of terrorist activities <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[1]</span> .</p><p>In as much as terrorism directly impacts on human rights, States have taken a number of measures to counter terrorism and some of these measures have posed severe threats to human rights and international security law. For example some states have used measures such as torture and other gross acts in the name of countering terrorism, disregarding outcries from legal independent organisations that are responsible for detection and prevention of torture. On the other hand, some states have been accused of sponsoring acts of terrorism in nations where they feel intimidated by grave abuse of their citizens due to torture among other violations. Thus, they have by themselves violated the international principle of non-refoulement; the respect for international security law has lacked its meaning in international fight against terrorism. This implies that, there is an urgent need to create national or even international counter-terrorism strategies that are not only intended to detect and prevent terrorism, and/or bring those responsible for these gross acts to book but they should also foster and protect human rights and international jurisprudence. Such measures should be directed towards the conducive factors that promote terrorism, these includes; the absence of basic rule of law, ethnic tensions, political extremisms, economic and religious discrimination, and most importantly the violation of human rights.</p><p><strong>Terrorism and counter-terrorism in the face of international security law</strong></p><p>Terrorism kills the values that are placed at the center of the United Nations Charter and other international bodies. These values include: peaceful conflict resolution, legal principles on armed conflict and safety of civilians, tolerance of other people’s views and opinions, and the respect for human rights. The negative effect of terrorism on human rights and international security has been noted and documented at the uppermost level of the UN; particularly by the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, and the UN Human Rights Council. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[2]</span> In particular, Member States have unambiguously agreed that terrorism: is a threat to the dignity and primary security of individuals and groups globally, puts the lives of innocent civilians in danger, creates a fearful environment, endangers fundamental freedoms, and violate human rights and the basic rule of law. In addition, terrorism is strongly linked to organized crimes such as money laundering, drug and human trafficking as well as illegal proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical materials. All these are linked to the effectual participation in serious crimes including assault, extortion, kidnapping, hostage taking and murder.</p><p>Moreover, terrorism perniciously impacts socio-economic development of states, kills friendly international relations among States, and negatively impacts the efforts of cooperation and peaceful co-existence among States, such as the cooperation for trade, growth and development. Terrorism also threatens the security of States as well as territorial integrity thus grossly violating the principles and values of the UN; this is a threat to the peace and security of the international community. This means that acts of terrorism must be suppressed by all means as an indispensable measure for the upholding of peace and security worldwide <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[3]</span> .</p><p>Both international and states’ human rights laws highlight that, in exclusive situations, States wield positive power to take precautionary operational measures to protect individuals or groups whose lives are known (or suspected) to be in danger due to unlawful acts of other individuals or groups-these of course includes terrorists. Significantly, the state is obligated to ensure that personal security of its citizens, especially where a threat exists or is suspected to exist <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[<a class="essay_footnotecitation_link" href="https://www.ukessays.com/essays/law/terrorism-and-counter-terrorism-in-international-security-law-international-law-essay.php#ftn4" name="bodyftn4">4</a>]</span> . In order to fulfill their security mandate and with respect for human rights and the rule of law, States have a reserved right and responsibility of taking effective counter-terrorism measures, to stop and avert future attacks from terrorists and to bring to book those that are responsible for these acts.</p><p>However, measures taken by States to counter terrorism present serious challenges to the fostering and protection of human rights. As the former UN secretary general stated,</p><p>“We should all be clear that there is no trade-off between effective action against terrorism and the protection of human rights On the contrary, I believe that, in the long term, we shall find that human rights, along with democracy and social justice, are one of the best prophylactics against terrorism.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[5]</span></p><p>Thus, the responsibility of States’ to protect individuals and groups within their jurisdiction together with all other undertaken in combating terrorism must be in tune with their obligations as stipulated in the international law, notably international human rights law, humanitarian law and refugee law.</p><p>In retrospect, in the same way terrorism negatively affects human rights, counter terrorism measures adopted by States too affect human rights. Since terrorism perniciously impacts on a number of fundamental human rights, it is the responsibility of States to create effective counter-terrorism strategies. These are the strategies that serve the dual purpose of protecting human rights and the reinforcement of States’ objectives of protecting individuals contained in their jurisdiction. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the US intensified its attack on Osama and his allies <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[6]</span> . The UN Security Council on its part moved swiftly to strengthen the legal structure for global cooperation and unified measures against threats of terrorism. The framework touched on key areas such as preventing the financing of terrorism, securing weapons of mass destruction from terrorists and the enhancement of sharing cross-border information by law enforcement agencies <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[7]</span> , together with the establishment of a surveillance body, referred to as, the ‘Counter-Terrorism Committee’. The later was mandated with the supervision of the implementation of the laid down measures. In addition to the UN’s measure, various regional counter-terrorism approaches have also been developed by organisations such as the African Union, the EU, the League of Arab States, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe among other <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[8]</span> .</p><p><strong>States’ obligations when countering terrorism</strong></p><p>The international community has risen up to adopt measures that uphold the international humanitarian law as the primary foundation of the war on terror. This has been outlined in the United Nations General Assembly resolution 60/288 that outlines the UN’s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Members resolved to take counter terrorism that comply with their respective obligations under international law- the international humanitarian law, refugee law, and human rights laws. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy asserts the relationship between human rights and international security; this puts the adherence to human rights laws and at the center of the international counter-terrorism approaches. With this strategy, Member States committed themselves to respect human rights and to follow the rule of law in their fight against terrorism <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[9]</span> .</p><p>The United Nations General Assembly has adopted a number of resolutions with regard to terrorism since December 1972. This has been aimed at the measures used by States and the UN in trying to eliminate global terrorism as well as those aimed at linking terrorism with human rights. The General Assembly has stressed that the measures taken by Member States must comply with their obligations under international security law. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[10]</span></p><p>Under the UN Charter, the Security Council has the chief responsibility of ensuring that peace and security is maintained internationally, this includes measures that highlight terrorism as a threat to global peace and security. Since its creation, the Security Council has undertaken several counter-terrorism actions against States; this has been in the form of sanctions <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[11]</span> . States considered to be linked in one way or another to certain groups of terrorism such as the Taliban and Al-Qaida.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The idea that there is no clear relationship between global war on terror in the form of counter-terrorism strategies and international security law is unfortunate. International security law recognizes the important frameworks that place human rights and international jurisprudence in the context of terrorism and counter-terrorism. In addition, counter-terrorism measures taken by States should prevent them from falling into snare of violating international security law as in the infringement of fundamental rights and democratic privileges-the very rights that terrorists flout and wish to wipe out. Currently, various counter-terrorism measures have been implemented by States, particularly since the heinous 9/11 attacks. However, such measures are not fully in tune with the international humanitarian law. This paper has outlined terrorism and counter terrorism in the light of increasing concern by NGOs and regional human rights organizations over the role of international security law in the war against terror.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>In an effort to get a firm hold on a slippery subject, those studying the phenomenon of terrorism were obliged to define it more precisely. Terrorism could be described simply as the use or threat of violence to create an atmosphere of fear and alarm and thus bring about a political result. But making this definition operative in political debate, rules of war, or criminal codes was anything but easy. Is all politically motivated violence terrorism? How does terrorism differ from ordinary crime? Should terrorism be considered a crime at all, or should it be seen as simply another form of armed conflict that is no less legitimate than any other form of war? Is the term properly reserved for those trying to overthrow governments, or can governments also be terrorists?</p><p>Definition was crucial because it ultimately determined the way in which terrorism has been studied. A major problem was that terrorism almost always has a pejorative connotation and thus falls in the same category of words as “tyranny” and “genocide,” unlike such relatively neutral terms such as “war” and “revolution.” One can aspire to objective and dispassionate research, but one cannot be neutral about terrorism any more than one can be neutral about torture. Thus, defining terrorism became an effort not only to delineate a subject area but also to maintain its illegitimacy. Even the most clinical inquiry was laden with values and therefore political issues. The very study of terrorism implied to some a political decision.</p><p>Terrorism can be defined objectively by the quality of the act, not by the identity of the perpetrators or the nature of their cause. All terrorist acts are crimes, and many also would be war crimes or “grave breaches” of the rules of war if one accepted the terrorists’ assertion that they wage war. All terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence, sometimes coupled with explicit demands. The violence is directed against noncombatants (Lesser, 1999). The purposes are political. The actions often are carried out in a way that will achieve maximum publicity, and the perpetrators are usually members of an organized group.</p><p>Terrorist organizations are by necessity clandestine, but unlike other criminals, terrorists often but not always claim credit for their acts. Finally – the hallmark of terrorism – the acts are intended to produce psychological effects. This introduces a distinction between the actual victims of terrorist violence and the target audience. The connection between the victim and the target of terrorism can be remote. The identity of the victims may be secondary or even irrelevant to the terrorist cause. “Pure terrorism” is entirely indiscriminate violence. Terrorism differs from ordinary crime in its political purpose and its primary objective. However, not all politically motivated violence is terrorism, nor is terrorism synonymous with guerilla war or any other kind of war.</p><p>Terrorist techniques can be used by governments or those fighting against governments: however, scholars generally use the term “terror” when discussing fear-producing tactics employed by governments and ‘terrorism’ when referring to tactics used by those fighting against governments. The distinction is primarily semantic. Both groups may use threats, assassinations, or abductions, but government terror also may include arbitrary imprisonment, concentration camps, torture, mind-affecting techniques, and the use of drugs for political purposes. Antigovernment terrorists generally lack the infrastructure for such tactics. Government terror produces more victims than terrorism does. Terrorists tend to seek more publicity than do governments (Lesser, 1999).</p><p>Although a prerequisite to empirical research, the attempt to define terrorism inevitably lent greater coherence to disparate acts of violence than did any analysis offered by the terrorists themselves, few of whom thought of assassinations, bombings, kidnappings, and airline hijackings as elements of a unified tactical repertoire, let alone the basis of a strategy. Ironically, in an effort to understand a phenomenon, researchers ran the risk of attributing to terrorists a level of strategic thinking they may not have possessed.</p><p>Qualitative, case-study research method has dominated the terrorism topic for many years. Since the number of observations in the greater part of this work is really small, researchers have been cautious to delineate terrorism to fit the cases under examination. The undersized quantity of observations, regrettably, often disallows unreliable dubious parts of the definition. In one country, for instance, hostility against the military might take place, but in the second country it might not. In an assessment of the first country, one could diverge the definition beyond civilian targets to military targets. In an assessment of the second country, one could not diverge the definition to investigate the implications of unreliable degrees from minimal to maximal definitions (Lesser, 1999).</p><p>In current research on terrorism in the science writing, there is plenty of room to diverge the definition of terrorism to identify with its consequences. Specifically, there is no need to decide on one particular definition of terrorism; multiple definitions can be allowed and then the effects can be empirically sorted out. Empirical analysis might generate two measures of terrorism: one with civilians as the target and the second with both civilians and the military at peace time as the target. Moreover, empirical analysis may demonstrate whether results are alike or diverse dependent on the measure. And any results would have implications for future theoretical and empirical research (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2004).</p><p>As science research on terrorism is turning out to be more and more quantitative, enough deviation is present within most databases on terrorism to investigate variations on definitions. Researchers should make lucid conceptual and conjectural arguments, but on main points of contention, empirical analysis can clarify what significant role the contention plays when implemented in a large quantity of cases. Research on terrorism has been very prolific in some fields, but carries on to spin its wheels in other ones. In general, the primary requirement is that units of scrutiny should be chosen to fit the theoretical argument, which often does not take place. Carrying attention away from definitional subject might result in great progress in the research of terrorism (Lesser, 1999).</p><p>Among the latest applications of agent-based modeling to terrorism is Leweling and Nissen (2007). They apply ABMs to assess how various counterterrorism choices influence horizontally versus vertically organized terrorist groups. Here goes one impending frontier for terrorism research: applying dynamic agent-based models to create predictions about which policies by governments can efficiently trim down terrorism. Akin to many of the formal models in the records of terrorism articles, there is no empirical analysis of the predictions of this exacting model. Combining event data on terrorist attacks with agent-based models is a would-be promising way to the fore.</p><p>Much research on terrorism has focused more narrowly on the topic. In part, this reflects the desire of researchers to avoid the murky, politically loaded area of underlying causes, where any discussion might be seen as condemnation or rationalization of terrorist violence. Nonetheless, there have been excellent case studies of individual groups and their tactics.</p><p>Defining terrorism in terms of the act has enabled researchers to maintain a theoretically objective approach and conduct at least some primitive quantitative analysis. Event-based analysis has enabled them to discern broad patterns and trends and chart the growth of terrorism and its diffusion around the globe. They have been able to demonstrate statistically that as terrorism has increased in volume, it has also become bloodier. Researchers were able to illustrate a clear trend toward incidents of large-scale indiscriminate violence in the 1980s and infer that terrorists tend to be more imitative than innovative in their tactics. Event-based analysis also has permitted researchers to distinguish the operational profiles of specific terrorist groups, and these profiles have been useful in identifying changes in a group’s modus operandi.</p><p>At the same time, event-based analysis has led the analysts into some methodological traps. An exclusive focus on terrorist actions, for example, resulted in terrorists being viewed first as if they were all part of a single entity and second as if they were almost extraterrestrial. While there are connections and alliances among some terrorist groups, the only thing the terrorists of the world have in common is a propensity for violence and certain tactics. Moreover, each group is rooted in its own social, political, and cultural soil, and cross-national comparisons are difficult. This has led to the question of whether there is such a thing as a terrorist-prone society.</p><p>It is, however, dangerous to attribute the actions of a few to perceived political defects or cultural flaws of a society as a whole, and researchers’ attempts to discern deeper causes or conditions that lead to high levels of terrorism in certain societies have produced meager results. Terrorism is not demonstrably a response to poverty or political oppression. The liberal democracies of Western Europe have suffered high levels of terrorist violence, while totalitarian states are virtually free of terrorism. Overall, countries with perceived terrorist problems tend to be comparatively advanced politically and economically. They are more highly urbanized and have higher per capita incomes, larger middle classes, more university students, and higher rates of literacy. One may ask whether political and economic advancement simply brings a more modern form of political violence.</p><p>One obstacle to linking high levels of terrorism with environmental factors is the problem of measuring terrorism. For the most part, this has been done by counting terrorist incidents, but international terrorism was narrowly and, more important, artificially defined to include only incidents that cause international concern, a distinction that has meant very little to the terrorists. Counting all terrorist incidents, both local and international, is better but still inadequate. Terrorist tactics, narrowly defined, represent most of what some groups, particularly those in Western Europe, do but for other groups, terrorism represents only one facet of a broader armed conflict. In civil war situations, such as that in Lebanon in the 1970s, separating incidents of terrorism from the background of violence and bloodshed was futile and meaningless. And what about the extensive unquantified political and communal violence in the rural backlands of numerous third world countries? Broad statements about terrorist-prone or violence-prone societies simply cannot be made by measuring only a thin terrorist crust of that violence, if at all. The problem, however, is not merely one of counting. Although terrorists arise from the peculiarities of local situations, they may become isolated in a tiny universe of beliefs and discourse that is alien to the surrounding society. German terrorists were German, but were they Germany? In the final analysis, one is forced to dismiss the notion of a terrorist-prone society.</p><p>If terrorism cannot be explained by environmental factors, one must look into the mind of the individual terrorist for an explanation. Are there individuals who are prone to becoming terrorists – a preterrorist personality? Encouraged by superficial similarities in the demographic profiles of terrorists – many of them have been urban middle and upper class (not economically deprived) males in their early twenties with university or at least secondary school educations – researchers searched for common psychological features.</p><p>Behavioral analysts painted an unappealing portrait: The composite terrorist appeared to be a person who was narcissistic, emotionally flat, easily disillusioned, incapable of enjoyment, rigid, and a true believer who was action-oriented and risk seeking. Psychiatrists could label terrorists as neurotic and possibly sociopathic, but they found that most of them were not clinically insane. Some behavioral analysts looked for deeper connections between terrorists’ attitude toward parents and their attitudes toward authority. A few went further in claiming a physiological explanation for terrorism based on inner ear disorders, but these assertions were not given wide credence in the scientific community. The growing number of terrorists apprehended and imprisoned in the 1980s permitted more thorough studies, but while these studies occasionally unearthed tantalizing similarities, they also showed terrorists to be a diverse lot.</p><p>Much research on terrorism has been government-sponsored and therefore oriented toward the practical goal of understanding terrorism in order to defeat it. While social scientists looked for environmental or behavioral explanations for terrorism, other researchers attempted to identify terrorist vulnerabilities and successful countermeasures. They achieved a measure of success in several areas. Studies of the human dynamics of hostage situations led to the development of psychological tactics that increased the hostages’ chances of survival and a better understanding (and therefore more effective treatment) of those who had been held hostage. In some cases, specific psychological vulnerabilities were identified and exploited. With somewhat less success, researchers also examined the effects of broader policies, such as not making concessions to terrorists holding hostages and using military retaliation. The conclusion in this area were less clear-cut.</p><p>Another area of research concerned the effects of terrorism on society. Here, researchers viewed terrorism as consisting of not only the sum of terrorist actions but also the fear and alarm produced by those actions. Public opinion polls, along with measurable decisions such as not flying and avoiding certain countries, provided the measure of effect.</p><p>Some critics who are skeptical of the entire field of terrorism analysis assert that the state and its accomplice scholars have “invented” terrorism as a political issue to further state agendas through manipulation of fear, the setting of public discourse, preemptive constructions of “good” and “evil”, and the creation of deliberate distractions from more serious issues. “Terrorism”, a pejorative term that is useful in condemning foes, has generated a lot of fear mongering, and the issue of terrorism has been harnessed to serve other agendas, but one would have to set aside the reality of terrorist campaigns to see terrorism solely as an invention of the hegemonic state. While such deconstructions reveal the ideological prejudices of their authors, they nonetheless have value in reminding other analysts to be aware of the lenses through which they view terrorism.</p><p>Over the years, research on terrorism has become more sophisticated, but in the end, terrorism confronts people with fundamental philosophical questions: Do ends justify means? How far does one go on behalf of a cause? What is the value of an individual human life? What obligations do governments have toward their own citizens if, for example, they are held hostage? Should governments or corporations ever bargain for human life? What limits can be imposed on individual liberties to ensure public safety? Is the use of military force, as a matter of choice, ever appropriate? Can assassination ever be justified? These are not matters of research. They are issues that have been dictated through the ages.</p><p>The free creation and exchange of knowledge by scientists can present dangerous, unintended consequences for society. A paper by Ronald Jackson and other researchers found that the insertion of IL-4 genes into mousepox viruses resulted in near total immunosuppression (Jackson, Ramsay, Christensen, et al. 2001). This advanced valuable knowledge about immune system functioning, but it also evoked fears that terrorists could use such knowledge to engineer hyper-virulent viruses. Similarly, the journal Science published a paper in 2002 that showed how to assemble a poliovirus from readily available chemicals (Cello, Aniko, Eckerd 2002). The threat of terrorist acts has caused political leaders and members of the scientific community to question whether such knowledge should be created, and if so, how its publication and exchange should be regulated.</p><p>The twentieth century provided several examples of tradeoffs between security and openness in the pursuit of knowledge. The Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bomb cultivated a culture of secrecy. A similar culture developed among researchers studying microwaves during World War II. During the Cold War, the U.S. government attempted to constrain information exchange in some areas of mathematics and the physical sciences that may have aided Soviet nuclear weapons development (Monastersky 2002).</p><p>In 1975, an international group of scientists held the Asilomar conference to debate the proper use and regulatory oversight of recombinant DNA research. During the late 1970s, the National Security Agency (NSA) regulated cryptographers developing new algorithms, but the two groups eventually agreed to a system of voluntary submission of papers for review. In 2002, the U.S. government began to withdraw from public release more than 6,600 technical documents dealing mainly with the production of germ and chemical weapons. In a controversial move, the U.S. national policy for the restriction of information that may threaten national security was altered in the wake of the September 11 attacks to include restrictions on publication of federally-financed research deemed to be “sensitive but not classified” (Greenberg 2002).</p><p>As these examples illustrate, limitations on research and the availability of technical knowledge can come in the form of self-imposed screening mechanisms by the scientific community or government regulation. The Asilomar conference, for example, led to a suite of self-policing mechanisms within the scientific community, including the decentralized system of Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs). This same mechanism has been proposed by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) as a way to prevent the misuse of biological research by terrorists. The NSABB also works to develop codes of conduct for researchers and laboratory workers, which underscores the importance of ethical conduct by individuals, especially where no rules exist or where the precise meaning of rules is unclear. Some professional associations and journals, including Science and Nature, have instituted procedures to give special scrutiny to papers that raise security concerns (Malakoff 2003). Putting such control in the hands of journal editors has caused some to argue that an advisory group like the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) would be a better mechanism.</p><p>Mitchel Wallerstein (2002) points out that the dangers posed by terrorists acquiring sensitive science and technology information differ from the state-related threats that were of primary concern during World War II and the Cold War. Terrorists generally do not seek out and would not be able to use the results of most basic research, but states may possess the intellectual and financial capital necessary to turn basic research into weapons. Daniel Greenberg (2002) contends that terrorists do not rely on new science. Rather, readily accessible information that has long been available suffices to fulfill most of the goals of terrorist organizations.</p><p>Restricting the publication of information deemed sensitive and controlling access to technologies and research materials can help achieve security goals, but not without costs (Knezo 2002a). Some impacts are relatively minor, such as new standards for the construction and management of laboratories. Other impacts are more severe, including the impact of national security policy measures on the research process. Tightened laboratory access policies, publication rules, and visa restrictions may reduce the number of applications by foreign students to U.S. universities and colleges. This could hamper cross-cultural understanding. According to State Department rules, consular officials may deny visas for study in the United States in sixteen categories specified on the Technology Alert List to students from countries listed as “state sponsors of terrorism”. Additional exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the withdrawal of information from federal agency websites have also sparked concerns about constraints on legitimate scientific work and academic freedoms.</p><p>Scientific research and technological innovations can improve performance of all phases, from threat analyses and vulnerability assessments to post-attack investigations and restoration of services. For example, the Bush administration established BioWatch, a nationwide system of sensors to detect the presence of certain pathogens, and a public-health surveillance system that monitors the databases of eight major cities for signs of disease outbreaks. Early warning systems can detect the presence of certain pathogens by utilizing computer chips and antibodies or pieces of DNA (Casagranda 2002). Explosives-detection technologies have also been spurred since September 11, 2001 in order to bolster airline security.</p><p>Other examples include the use of biometrics (e.g., fingerprints and retinal signatures) to develop national security identity cards. The shipping industry is slowly adopting new security measures such as sophisticated seals and chemical sensors. Other researchers are developing strategies for securing information systems. Military infrared countermeasures for surface-to-air missiles may be used on civilian aircraft. Technologies for decontamination, blast-resistant walls, and protective gear for first responders are other components of research programs. Increasing flexibility and innovating measures to isolate failing elements could increase security of more complex technical systems such as transportation and communication infrastructures. Researching and developing broader applications of renewable energy can harden the energy infrastructure. Social scientists and psychologists also provide research for understanding causes and motivations of terrorists as well as the dynamics of terrorist group formation. Some (e.g., Susser, Herman, Aaron 2002) have demonstrated that, because terrorists choose targets to maximize psychological impact, mental health must be considered a top response priority.</p><p>With all of these potential applications of science and technology, decision makers need to address questions about how to coordinate, organize, prioritize, and evaluate investments to serve the goals of security and public health. Genevieve Knezo (2002b) reported that prior to September 11, 2001, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other authorities had questioned whether the U.S. government was adequately prepared to conduct and use R&amp;D to prevent and combat terrorism. Partially in response to the need to better coordinate counterterrorism efforts (including R&amp;D), the cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created by legislative act in 2002. This incorporated half of all homeland security funding within a single agency. In addition to legislative activity, new advisory bodies such as the NSABB have been formed to guide the creation of new rules and development of new institutions to maximize the benefits of science and technology while minimizing unintended negative impacts.</p><p>Increased scientific research on counterterror measures will create new knowledge and opportunities for terrorist exploitation, which will create new challenges for securing that knowledge. Given that security, health, and civil liberties are at stake in decisions about science and terrorism, it is important that measures be taken to involve and inform citizens. This entry has focused on actions by the U.S. government because it plays a leading role in matters of science and terrorism. But other countries and international coalitions face similar ethical dilemmas and policy choices. Private companies own many of the infrastructures that are targets for terrorist attacks, so regulations may be required to induce the private sector to invest in counterterrorism technologies that may not have commercial markets. Some scientific research, however, may have viable market applications, meaning that some of the R&amp;D burden can be privatized, which raises other ethical issues that partially mirror those involved in the privatization of war.</p><p>Terrorism is a subject matter, not a discipline. It has been approached by scholars from various academic perspectives with political scientists in the lead.</p><p>In an effort to get a firm hold on a slippery subject, those studying the phenomenon of terrorism were obliged to define it more precisely. Terrorism could be described simply as the use or threat of violence to create an atmosphere of fear and alarm and thus bring about a political result. But making this definition operative in political debate, rules of war, or criminal codes was anything but easy. Is all politically motivated violence terrorism?

With somewhat less success, researchers also examined the effects of broader policies, such as not making concessions to terrorists holding hostages and using military retaliation. The conclusion in this area were less clear-cut.</p><p>Another area of research concerned the effects of terrorism on society. Here, researchers viewed terrorism as consisting of not only the sum of terrorist actions but also the fear and alarm produced by those actions. Public opinion polls, along with measurable decisions such as not flying and avoiding certain countries, provided the measure of effect.</p><p>Some critics who are skeptical of the entire field of terrorism analysis assert that the state and its accomplice scholars have “invented” terrorism as a political issue to further state agendas through manipulation of fear, the setting of public discourse, preemptive constructions of “good” and “evil”, and the creation of deliberate distractions from more serious issues. “Terrorism”, a pejorative term that is useful in condemning foes, has generated a lot of fear mongering, and the issue of terrorism has been harnessed to serve other agendas, but one would have to set aside the reality of terrorist campaigns to see terrorism solely as an invention of the hegemonic state. While such deconstructions reveal the ideological prejudices of their authors, they nonetheless have value in reminding other analysts to be aware of the lenses through which they view terrorism.</p><p>Over the years, research on terrorism has become more sophisticated, but in the end, terrorism confronts people with fundamental philosophical questions: Do ends justify means? How far does one go on behalf of a cause? What is the value of an individual human life? What obligations do governments have toward their own citizens if, for example, they are held hostage? Should governments or corporations ever bargain for human life? What limits can be imposed on individual liberties to ensure public safety? Is the use of military force, as a matter of choice, ever appropriate? Can assassination ever be justified? These are not matters of research. They are issues that have been dictated through the ages.</p><p>The free creation and exchange of knowledge by scientists can present dangerous, unintended consequences for society. A paper by Ronald Jackson and other researchers found that the insertion of IL-4 genes into mousepox viruses resulted in near total immunosuppression (Jackson, Ramsay, Christensen, et al. 2001). This advanced valuable knowledge about immune system functioning, but it also evoked fears that terrorists could use such knowledge to engineer hyper-virulent viruses. Similarly, the journal Science published a paper in 2002 that showed how to assemble a poliovirus from readily available chemicals (Cello, Aniko, Eckerd 2002). The threat of terrorist acts has caused political leaders and members of the scientific community to question whether such knowledge should be created, and if so, how its publication and exchange should be regulated.</p><p>The twentieth century provided several examples of tradeoffs between security and openness in the pursuit of knowledge. The Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bomb cultivated a culture of secrecy. A similar culture developed among researchers studying microwaves during World War II. During the Cold War, the U.S. government attempted to constrain information exchange in some areas of mathematics and the physical sciences that may have aided Soviet nuclear weapons development (Monastersky 2002).</p><p>In 1975, an international group of scientists held the Asilomar conference to debate the proper use and regulatory oversight of recombinant DNA research. During the late 1970s, the National Security Agency (NSA) regulated cryptographers developing new algorithms, but the two groups eventually agreed to a system of voluntary submission of papers for review. In 2002, the U.S. government began to withdraw from public release more than 6,600 technical documents dealing mainly with the production of germ and chemical weapons. In a controversial move, the U.S. national policy for the restriction of information that may threaten national security was altered in the wake of the September 11 attacks to include restrictions on publication of federally-financed research deemed to be “sensitive but not classified” (Greenberg 2002).</p><p>As these examples illustrate, limitations on research and the availability of technical knowledge can come in the form of self-imposed screening mechanisms by the scientific community or government regulation. The Asilomar conference, for example, led to a suite of self-policing mechanisms within the scientific community, including the decentralized system of Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs). This same mechanism has been proposed by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) as a way to prevent the misuse of biological research by terrorists. The NSABB also works to develop codes of conduct for researchers and laboratory workers, which underscores the importance of ethical conduct by individuals, especially where no rules exist or where the precise meaning of rules is unclear. Some professional associations and journals, including Science and Nature, have instituted procedures to give special scrutiny to papers that raise security concerns (Malakoff 2003). Putting such control in the hands of journal editors has caused some to argue that an advisory group like the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) would be a better mechanism.</p><p>Mitchel Wallerstein (2002) points out that the dangers posed by terrorists acquiring sensitive science and technology information differ from the state-related threats that were of primary concern during World War II and the Cold War. Terrorists generally do not seek out and would not be able to use the results of most basic research, but states may possess the intellectual and financial capital necessary to turn basic research into weapons. Daniel Greenberg (2002) contends that terrorists do not rely on new science. Rather, readily accessible information that has long been available suffices to fulfill most of the goals of terrorist organizations.</p><p>Restricting the publication of information deemed sensitive and controlling access to technologies and research materials can help achieve security goals, but not without costs (Knezo 2002a). Some impacts are relatively minor, such as new standards for the construction and management of laboratories. Other impacts are more severe, including the impact of national security policy measures on the research process. Tightened laboratory access policies, publication rules, and visa restrictions may reduce the number of applications by foreign students to U.S. universities and colleges. This could hamper cross-cultural understanding. According to State Department rules, consular officials may deny visas for study in the United States in sixteen categories specified on the Technology Alert List to students from countries listed as “state sponsors of terrorism”. Additional exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the withdrawal of information from federal agency websites have also sparked concerns about constraints on legitimate scientific work and academic freedoms.</p><p>Scientific research and technological innovations can improve performance of all phases, from threat analyses and vulnerability assessments to post-attack investigations and restoration of services. For example, the Bush administration established BioWatch, a nationwide system of sensors to detect the presence of certain pathogens, and a public-health surveillance system that monitors the databases of eight major cities for signs of disease outbreaks. Early warning systems can detect the presence of certain pathogens by utilizing computer chips and antibodies or pieces of DNA (Casagranda 2002). Explosives-detection technologies have also been spurred since September 11, 2001 in order to bolster airline security.</p><p>Other examples include the use of biometrics (e.g., fingerprints and retinal signatures) to develop national security identity cards. The shipping industry is slowly adopting new security measures such as sophisticated seals and chemical sensors. Other researchers are developing strategies for securing information systems. Military infrared countermeasures for surface-to-air missiles may be used on civilian aircraft. Technologies for decontamination, blast-resistant walls, and protective gear for first responders are other components of research programs. Increasing flexibility and innovating measures to isolate failing elements could increase security of more complex technical systems such as transportation and communication infrastructures. Researching and developing broader applications of renewable energy can harden the energy infrastructure. Social scientists and psychologists also provide research for understanding causes and motivations of terrorists as well as the dynamics of terrorist group formation. Some (e.g., Susser, Herman, Aaron 2002) have demonstrated that, because terrorists choose targets to maximize psychological impact, mental health must be considered a top response priority.</p><p>With all of these potential applications of science and technology, decision makers need to address questions about how to coordinate, organize, prioritize, and evaluate investments to serve the goals of security and public health. Genevieve Knezo (2002b) reported that prior to September 11, 2001, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other authorities had questioned whether the U.S. government was adequately prepared to conduct and use R&amp;D to prevent and combat terrorism. Partially in response to the need to better coordinate counterterrorism efforts (including R&amp;D), the cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created by legislative act in 2002. This incorporated half of all homeland security funding within a single agency. In addition to legislative activity, new advisory bodies such as the NSABB have been formed to guide the creation of new rules and development of new institutions to maximize the benefits of science and technology while minimizing unintended negative impacts.</p><p>Increased scientific research on counterterror measures will create new knowledge and opportunities for terrorist exploitation, which will create new challenges for securing that knowledge. Given that security, health, and civil liberties are at stake in decisions about science and terrorism, it is important that measures be taken to involve and inform citizens. This entry has focused on actions by the U.S. government because it plays a leading role in matters of science and terrorism. But other countries and international coalitions face similar ethical dilemmas and policy choices. Private companies own many of the infrastructures that are targets for terrorist attacks, so regulations may be required to induce the private sector to invest in counterterrorism technologies that may not have commercial markets. Some scientific research, however, may have viable market applications, meaning that some of the R&amp;D burden can be privatized, which raises other ethical issues that partially mirror those involved in the privatization of war.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>A further development of the principles of the Roman Law through ecclesiastical influence was in the matter of the disposition of personal property upon the decease of the owner. Originally, as it will be remembered, the feudal tenure was only for life. Upon the death of the occupant every feudal holding reverted to the feudal lord. When the right of inheritance was introduced, it only applied to real estate. In fact, in our system it applies to real estate now. Personal property continued to be seized and appropriated by the feudal lord. It is true there was usually not much of it within the domain and the sphere of action of Feudalism. Cattle and agricultural implements constituted the bulk of it. But what little there was became the spoil of the feudal lord as soon as the owner had been called away by death; and wife and children were ruthlessly deprived of the support which it might have been to them.</p><p>It was a case of brutal oppression and wrong, under the form of law, if the word law is not desecrated by the application to the infamous usage, which justified the most forcible intervention on the part of the ecclesiastical authorities. Appeal was made to the conscience of the feudal lord. Perhaps, there should be an apology for the use of the word conscience in any such connection. At all events, the thunders of the Church were invoked against the feudalist who insisted upon the exercise of his feudal prerogative; and the Church finally succeeded in getting the personal property of deceased persons into its own possession for the benefit of their families and relations. Thereupon, each ordinary or bishop within his own diocese, immediately upon the happening of a death, became the lawful custodian and administrator of all personal property within his territorial jurisdiction. The administration he committed to competent persons as each case arose; and he himself only retained the jurisdiction to see that it was properly conducted.</p><p>On the continent of Europe, with the revival and extension of the Roman Law, this ecclesiastical jurisdiction ceased at a comparatively early date. In England it continued to be the usual system down even beyond the middle of the second last century. The administration of the personal estates of deceased persons was no part of the Common Law of that country; it belonged to the ecclesiastical authorities. The courts for that purpose, courts of probate, as they have been called, because they take the probate of wills for the transmission of personal property, were the courts of the bishops; and the law administered by them was notoriously the Canon, and the Civil Law of Rome. The custom has left its impression upon our American law. For, although our ancestors brought with them what is called the Common Law of England, and although they could not, and did not bring with them the bishops and ecclesiastical courts, and were compelled immediately to supply the deficiency by the establishment, through the instrumentality of statute, of special courts for the purpose, generally known through-out the country either as Orphans’ Court or Courts of Probate, it is a curious fact that the law which they administer is and always has been the Roman Law. A remarkable illustration of it is the fact, that, our laws for the distribution of personal property are purely those of the Civil Law of Rome. We have retained the tradition of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction the bishops were unfettered by feudal restraint.</p><p>With his usual misrepresentation, and even deliberate mendacity, for he knew better, where the Church was concerned in her relations to the feudal power, Blackstone wishes us to believe that the Kings voluntarily surrendered their right to the personal property of those who died intestate to the ordinary or bishop for proper distribution of them, that the ordinary was often recreant to his trust, and that it required two statutes to compel him to execute the trust properly and to depute the administration to the next of kin or some near friend of the deceased. A careful consideration of these statutes and of the circumstances under which they were made will show that the great commentator has wilfully misrepresented their tenor and import, and that they were enacted at the solicitation of the bishops themselves for the purpose of having a uniform law through-out all England. There was no question in them of breach of trust on the part of the bishops or ordinaries and even if breach of trust there had been, of which there may well have been individual instances, the fact does not militate against our contention that the ecclesiastical action in rescuing personal property of deceased persons from the grasp of the king or feudal lord was a check to Feudalism and a revival to that extent of the principles of the Roman Law.</p><p>courtesy:historyoflaw.info</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><a href="http://issuu.com/rose1990/docs/text_string_extraction_from_scene_i?mode=window&amp;viewMode=singlePage"> View with images and charts</a></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Text String Extraction from Scene Image</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Based on Morphological Features</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter: 1 </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.1 Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the digitalization of the world, it becomes more and more important to extract text from image. Because text data present in images contain useful information for automatic annotation, indexing and structuring of images. Furthermore, text printed on the cover of magazine, signs, indicators, billboards etc always mixes with photos and designs <b><sup>[1]</sup></b>. This kind of texts in scene images may take much information and thus need to separate text string from scene image. There are numerous applications of a text information extraction system, including document analysis, vehicle license plate extraction, technical paper analysis, and object oriented data compression. In the following, we briefly describe some of these applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ Using Automatic Business Card Reader (BCR), necessary contact information can be directly populated into the phonebook from the business cards. Although, such applications are commercially available in some mobile handsets, the accuracy is yet to be extended to be really useful in practice. It is observed that graphic backgrounds are commonly found in most business card images. In order to recognize the text information from the card, the text and background contents must be separated <b><sup>[2]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ Text printed on the cover of magazine always mixes with photos and designs. This kind of text in scene images may take much information and automatic recognition can be useful for visually impaired persons and foreign travelers. For example, automatic recognition of signs and indicators can help the blind people to move on the streets freely. Also, recognition of magazine cover can help to extract the information into database quickly for library to improve the efficiency of classification<sup> <b>[1]</b></sup>.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Used in OCR (Optical character Recognition). OCR software enables us to successfully extract the text from an image (and not only) and convert it into an editable text document.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Also used for Form Processing, Maps Interpretations, bank cheque processing, postal address sorting and Engineering drawing interpretation.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Our main objective is to extract text from scene image. In this paper, we discuss a novel approaches for detecting and extracting text from scene image based on morphological features.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Text extraction system involves detection and extraction of the text from a given image. However, variations of text due to differences in size, style, orientation and alignment, as well as low image contrast and complex background make the problem of automatic text extraction extremely challenging. Thus, extracting texts from image is not too simple.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.2 Previous works and overview of our approach</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several types of technologies have been developed to extract text from scene image. Nirmala Shivananda and P. Nagabhushan <b><sup>[1]</sup></b> proposed a hybrid method for separating text from color document images. But this method can’t extract text from complex graphics. Partha Pratim Roy, Josep Llad´os and Umapada Pal <b><sup>[3]</sup></b> proposed a method for separating text from color map based on connected component analysis and grouping of characters in a string. This approach can detect the characters, connected to graphics and can separate them. But some of the characters can’t separate through connected component analysis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For gaining better result we use Lixu Gu’s <b><sup>[4 ]</sup></b> approach, which is based on mathematical morphology. We also focus on the limitations of Gu’s approach. This approach includes two distinct stages – Primary processing and Extraction processing. In primary processing, we give input image and use a new shape decomposition filter based on morphological recursive opening and closing. The input image can be color or gray scale image. The proposed filter decomposes input image into several subimages based on the size of the characters. Extraction processing includes three steps – feature emphasis, character extraction and noise reduction. In feature emphasis step, a new morphological filter used to emphasis characters features in subimages and remove most of the noise. By histogram method characters are extracted from subimages in character extraction step. Lastly, using a morphological filter based on closing is implemented for noise reduction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Chapter 2 provides image processing basics. Morphological concepts for image processing are discussed in chapter 3. In Chapter 4 we describe our method. Experimental results with scene images and discussions are discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Chapter 6.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter: 2 </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Image Processing Basics</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Digital image processing is an important area in Computer Science. As vision is the most advanced of our senses, so it is not surprising that images play the single most important role in human perception. Thus, before starting our discussion we have to familiar with image processing basics.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter we describe very basics of digital image processing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.1 Digital Image Processing</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any 2D mathematical function that bears information can be represented as an image. A digital image is an array of real or complex numbers represented by a finite number of numbers of elements. These elements are referred to as picture elements, image elements, pels, and pixels. Pixel is used to denote the elements of a digital image.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Digital image processing generally refers to processing of a 2D picture by a digital computer. An image may be defined as a two-dimensional function, f(x, y), where x and y are spatial coordinates, and the amplitude of f at any pair of coordinates (x, y) is called the intensity or gray level of the image at that point. When x, y, and the amplitude values of f are all finite, discrete quantities, we call the image a digital image <b><sup>[5]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Digital image processing is the use of computer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> to perform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing" title="Image processing">image processing</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image" title="Digital image">digital images</a> <b><sup>[6]</sup></b>. Many types of remote sensing images are routinely recorded in digital form and then processed by computers to produce images for interpreters to study. The simplest form of digital image processing employs a microprocessor that converts the digital data tape into a film image with minimal corrections and calibrations. At the other extreme, large mainframe computers are employed for sophisticated interactive manipulation of the data to produce images in which specific information has been extracted and highlighted <b><sup>[7]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An image given in the form of a transparency, slide, photograph, or chart is first digitized and stored as a matrix of binary digits in computer memory. This digitized image can then be processed and<b>/</b>or displayed on a high resolution television monitor. For display, the image is stored in a rapid-access buffer memory which refreshes the monitor at 30 frames<b>/</b>s to produce a visibly continuous display. Mini-or microcomputers are used to communicate and control all the digitization, storage, processing, and display operations via a computer are made through a terminal, and the outputs are available on a terminal, television monitor, or a printer/plotter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2 Digital Image Representation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Virtual image, a point or system of points, on one side of a mirror or lens, which, if it existed, would emit the system of rays which actually exists on the other side of the mirror or lens.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">–Clerk Maxwell</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We need a coordinate system to describe an image, the coordinate system used to place elements in relation to each other is called<em>user space</em><i>,</i> since this is the coordinates the user uses to define elements and position them in relation to each other <b><sup>[8 ]</sup></b>.</p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Y</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>(1, 1)</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 2.2 (a): Coordinate system</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Representation for a digitalized image function in the coordinate system is given below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">f(0,0) f(0,1) <b>…………</b> f(0,N-1)</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>:</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">f(x,y) = f(1,0) f(1,1) <b>…………</b> f(1,N-1)</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>:</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">f(M-1,0) f(M-1,1) <b>…………</b> f(M-1,N-1)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The right side of this equation is a digital image by definition where the image has M rows and N columns. That is the image is of size M x N <b><sup>[5]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3 Image Properties</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="50856"></a>In addition to the pixel data, images occasionally have many other kinds of data associated with them. These data, known as <em>properties</em>, is a simple database of arbitrary data attached to the images. Each property is simply an Object with a unique, case insensitive name <b><sup>[9]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3.1 Color</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Color is an important attribute for image matching and retrieval (see (Niblack et al.,1993)).”Color is the most widely used attribute in image retrieval and object recognition. Humans seem not to be as affected by small variations in color as by variations in gray level values. A color image is usually stored in memory as a raster map, a two-dimensional array of small integer triplets; or (rarely) as three separate raster maps, one for each channel. Eight bits per sample (24 bits per pixel) seem to be adequate for most uses. A (digital) color image is a digital image that includes color information for each pixel.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3.2 Texture</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Small surface structure, natural or artificial, regular or irregular is call texture. Statistical texture analysis describes texture as a whole based on specific attributes: regularity, coarseness, orientation, contrast etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Texture Examples: wood barks, knitting patterns etc.</p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 2.3.2(a): Example of Texture.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.4 Applications of Image Processing</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Digital image processing has a broad spectrum of applications, such as remote sensing via satellites and other spacecrafts, image transmission and storage for business applications, medical imaging, radar, sonar, and acoustic image processing, robotics, and automated inspection of industrial parts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(a) In Satellite</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Images acquired by satellites are useful in tracking of earth resources, geographical mapping, prediction of agricultural crops, urban growth, and weather, flood and fire control, and many other environmental applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(b) In Robot Vision</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In roboting, inside and outside robot navigation, automatic inspection of industrial process, pattern recognition etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (c) Space Image Application</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Space image applications include recognition and analysis of objects contained in images obtained from deep space-probe missions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(d) Image Transmission and Storage</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Image transmission and storage applications occur in broadcast television, teleconferencing, transmission of facsimile images (printed documents and graphics) for office automation , communication over computer networks and closed-circuit television based security monitoring systems, and in military communications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(e) In Medical Application</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In medical applications one is concerned with processing of chest X rays, cineangiojgrams, projection images of transaxial tomography and other medical images that occur in radiology, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultrasonic scanning. These images may be used for patient screening and monitoring or for detection of tumors or other disease in patients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(f) Radar and Sonar Image Application</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Radar and sonar images are used for detection and recognition of various types of targets or in guidance and maneuvering of aircraft or missile systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(g) Other Applications</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are many other applications ranging from robot vision for industrial automation to image synthesis for cartoon making or fashion design.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;">2.5 Problems with Digital Image Processing</h4><h4 style="text-align: justify;">There are some problems which associated with digital image processing. These are given below:</h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(a) Image Compression</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A modern trend in image storage and transmission is to use digital techniques. Digitizing a television signal results in -100 megabits per second. But channel bandwidth is expensive. So for applications such as teleconferencing, one wants to use a channel of 64 kilobits per second. For other applications such as videophone and mobile videophone, even lower channel bandwidths (e.g., 9 kilobits per second) are desirable <b><sup>[10]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(b) Image Enhancement</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In enhancement, one aims to process images to improve their quality. An image may be of poor quality because its contrast is low, or it is noisy, or it is blurred, etc. Many algorithms have been devised to remove these degradations. The difficult problem is how to remove degradations without hurting the signal. For example, noise-reduction algorithms typically involve local, averaging or smoothing which, unfortunately, will blur the edges in the image. Adaptive methods have been investigated-e.g., smoothing less near the edges. However, they are generally effective only if the degradation is slight <b><sup>[10]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(c) Image Recognition</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, a recognition system needs to classify an unknown input pattern into one of a set of pre-specified classes. The task is fairly easy if the number of classes is small and if all members in the same class are almost exactly the same. However, the problem can become very difficult if the number of classes is very large or if members in the same class can look very different <b><sup>[10]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(d) Image Representation and Modeling</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An image could represent luminances of objects in a scene (image taken by camera), the absorption characteristics of the body tissue or material particles (X-ray imaging), radar cross-section of a target (radar imaging), the temperature profile of a region (infrared imaging), the gravitational field in an area (geophysical imaging). An important consideration in image representation is the fidelity or intelligibility criteria for measuring the quality of an image or the performance of a processing technique. Specification of such measures requires models of perception of contrast, spatial frequencies, color and so on. Knowledge of a fidelity criterion helps in designing the imaging sensor, because it tells us the variables that should be measured most accurately.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A classical method of signal representation is by an orthogonal series expansion, such as the Fourier series. For images analogous representation is possible via two-dimensional orthogonal functions called basic images. For sample images the basis images can be determined from unitary matrices called image transformations. Any given image can be expressed as a weighted sum of the basis images. Several characteristics of images, such as their spatial frequency content, band-width, power spectrum, and application in filter design, feature extraction, and so on, can be studied via such expansions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Statistical models describe an image as a member of an ensemble, often characterized by its mean and covariance functions. This permits development of algorithms that are useful for an entire class or an ensemble of images rather than for a single image.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In global modeling, image is considered as a composition of several objects. Various objects in the scene are detected (for example, by segmentation techniques), and the model gives the rules for defining the relationship among various objects.

In digital image processing, mathematical morphology is considered as a tool for extracting image components that are useful in the representation and description of region shape, such as boundaries and the convex hull. For our experiment, we use some fundamental morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, opening, closing etc <b><sup>[5]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter we emphasis some preliminaries on text string extraction tools.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;">3.1 Mathematical Morphology</h4><p style="text-align: justify;">Mathematical morphology (MM) is a theory and technique for the analysis and processing of geometrical structures, based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory" title="Set theory">set theory</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_theory" title="Lattice theory">lattice theory</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology" title="Topology">topology</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_function" title="Random function">random functions</a>.

For example, one s.e. can be a 3×3 square or a 21 x 21 square.

Its basic syntax is</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><tt>se = strel(shape, parameters)</tt></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where shape is a string specifying the desired shape, and parameters is a list of parameters that specify information about the shape, such as its size.

The value of each pixel in the output image is based on a comparison of the corresponding pixel in the input image with its neighbors. By choosing the size and shape of the neighborhood, we can construct a morphological operation that is sensitive to specific shapes in the input image<b><sup>[14]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Morphological operations has been widely used to process binary and grayscale images, with morphological techniques being applied to noise reduction, image enhancement, and feature detection.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Morphological operations modify the shape of a component or give information about the shape of a component. Mathematical morphology includes four basic operations:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Dilation (expand a component)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Erosion (shrink a component)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. Opening and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. Closing</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.4.1 Dilation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dilation is also called Minkowski addition. It is an operation that “grows” or “thickens” objects in a binary image. The specific manner and extent of this thickening is controlled by a shape referred to as a structuring element. This process can only turn pixels from OFF to ON. Dilation is used to increase the area of a component. It Adds pixels around the boundaries and fills interior holes. The value of the output pixel is the <em>maximum</em> value of all the pixels in the input pixel’s neighborhood. In a binary image, if any of the pixels is set to the value <tt>1</tt>, the output pixel is set to 1 <b><sup>[5]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An image is processed by applying a structuring element</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Center the structuring element S on pixel P.</li><li>If P is OFF then set it to ON if any part of S overlaps an ON image pixel.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Given binary image f and structuring element s the dilated image g can be described as:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">g = f s</p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>k = -m/2</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>k = -n/2</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">g( x , y ) = v v f ( x-k, y-l) s(k,l)</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>1 if s hits f</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>0 otherwise</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">g( x , y ) = {</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Properties of Morphological dilation is given below-</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>Commutative : D(A,B) = A B = B A = D(B,A)</li><li>Associative : A (B C) = (A B) C</li><li>Translation Invariance: A (B + x) = (A B) + x</li><li>Decomposition : A (B U C) = (A B) U (A C)</li><li>Multi-dilations: nB = B B B B ………….

We usually try to segment regions by identifying common properties. Or, similarly, we identify contours by identifying differences between regions (edges).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest property that pixels in a region can share it’s intensity. So, a natural way to segment such regions is through thresholding, the separation of light and dark regions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thresholding creates binary images from grey-level ones by turning all pixels below some threshold to zero and all pixels about that threshold to one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If g(x, y) is a thresholded version of f(x, y) at some global threshold T,</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>1, if f(x,y)? T</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>0, Otherwise</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">g(x,y) = {</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The major problem with thresholding is that we consider only the intensity, not any relationships between the pixels. There is no guarantee that the pixels identified by the thresholding process are contiguous. We can easily include extraneous pixels that aren’t part of the desired region, and we can just as easily miss isolated pixels within the region (especially near the boundaries of the region). These effects get worse as the noise gets worse, simply because it’s more likely that pixels intensity doesn’t represent the normal intensity in the region.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When we use thresholding, we typically have to play with it, sometimes losing too much of the region and sometimes getting too many extraneous background pixels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another problem with global thresholding is that changes in illumination across the scene may cause some parts to be brighter (in the light) and some parts darker (in shadow) in ways that have nothing to do with the objects in the image.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We can deal, at least in part, with such uneven illumination by determining thresholds locally. That is, instead of having a single global threshold, we allow the threshold itself to smoothly vary across the image.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To set a global threshold or to adapt a local threshold to an area, we usually look at the histogram to see if we can find two or more distinct modes—one for the foreground and one for the background.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Recall that a histogram is a probability distribution:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">p (g) = n<sub>g</sub>/n</p><p style="text-align: justify;">That is, the number of pixels, n<sub>g, </sub>having greyscale intensity <i>g </i>as a fraction of the total number of pixels n <b><sup>[14]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.6 Finding Peaks and Valleys</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">One extremely simple way to find a suitable threshold is to find each of the modes (local maxima) and then find the valley (minimum) between them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While this method appears simple, there are two main problems with it:</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>The histogram may be noisy, thus causing many local minima and maxima. To get around this, the histogram is usually smoothed before trying to find separate modes.</li><li>The sum of two separate distributions, each with their own mode, may not produce a distribution with two distinct modes <b><sup>[14]</sup></b>.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter: 4</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Our Method</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Extraction of text from scene image is much difficult than extraction from simple document image. A lot of researches succeeded in extracting single text string from images, but can not deal with image including many text strings <b><sup>[15]</sup></b>. Here we describe and implement Gu’s algorithm that uses mathematical morphology to extract text effectively. Mathematical morphology provides us the theory and tools to capture geodesic information. Hence structure segmentation and shape representation have been popularly operated by Morphological approaches. A primary morphology based approach – top-hats transformation (TT) provides an excellent tool for extracting bright or dark objects from uneven background. But too many complicated segmentation problems, the TT alone cannot provide satisfactory solutions. When a series of structure elements with various sizes have been employed in our study, the gray scale particle segmentation for some complex cases is realized successfully in an iterative manner based on the TT. Here we try to implement a method which was derived based on TT idea <b><sup>[16]</sup></b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Block diagram of the proposed method is given in figure 4(a).</p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Gray scale image</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Decomposition into subimages</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Input</b></p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top"></td><td></td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Scene </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> images Shape decomposition filter</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Primary Process</b></p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left" colspan="9" valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Emphasis character features and noise reduction</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Extraction of characters from subimages</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Noise reduction from character regions</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td></td><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Composed subimages</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td></td><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td></td><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td></td><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td></td><td align="left" valign="top"></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><b>Output images</b></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Subimages</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Morphological Histogram Morphological</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Filter method Filter </b></p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Text Extraction Process</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 4(a): Block diagram of Text Extraction Process</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.1 Conception and Notation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Characters in scene images may be characterized by word, “they float on the background or sink under it with a flat surface”. This characteristic underlines the basic idea of our new method. The aim of our new method is to separate the characters from the background. The whole process is divided into two distinct stages:</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>Primary processing (shape decomposition filter)</li><li>Extraction processing.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">– Feature emphasis</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Character extraction</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Noise reduction</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the first stage, a new shape decomposition filter based on morphological recursive opening and closing is implemented. This filter decomposes a gray scale input image into a series of sub images according to the size of characters. In the second stage, we first employ a new morphological filter to emphasize characters’ features in the sub images and remove most noises out of them, and then, the characters are extracted directly from the gray scale sub images by the histogram method. Lastly, a morphological image cleaning algorithm based on morphological conditional dilation is introduced to make the extracted character region distinct from noise. The resulting sub images are composed together to produce the final result in binary<sup> <b>[4]</b></sup>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.2 Morphological Notations</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The original grey scale image is decomposed into a series of sub images with different size of characters. Scene image involves numbers of components besides characters, it is difficult to be dealt in general view, and thus we compose it into simpler ones in our first processing stage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The decomposition will be implemented by the morphological algorithm, and a set of particular structure elements which are derived from 3 x 3region of support in a recursive manner will also be used. For a given simplest structure element B, which may be a disk, a square, a triangle (in the Euclidean space R<sup>2</sup>), a sphere, or a cube (in the Euclidean space R<sup>3</sup>), etc., a set of structure element X<sub>i</sub> is defined by</p><p style="text-align: justify;">X<sub>i</sub> = r<sub>i</sub>B ……………………………………………………… <b>(1)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When r<sub>i</sub> is an integer, above equation is equivalent to the following relation, if B is bounded and convex:</p><table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top"></td><td></td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top"></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">X<sub>i </sub>= B B …………..

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;">View With Charts And Images</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Textile Sectors In Bangladesh</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abstract:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Spinning Mills in Bangladesh is increasing rapidly and machinery form India, Japan, Switzerland, China, italy, Germany &amp; UK are imported for this purpose. Though new Machine manufacturers are penetrating in the market of Bangladesh. Japanese machine still dominating and Zechosolokia has monopoly in exporting rotor Spinning frame to Bangladesh. Most of Mills are equipped with modern testing facility including High Volume Instrument (HVI) &amp; Advance Fiber Information System (AFIS) and utilities like humidification plan, Chiller, Generator, Boiler, Water &amp; Gases etc. Lot of raw cotton is imported from CIS countries and 50% of product yarn used for export quality fabric.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ratio technical person, production related workers, administrative manpower is 0.756 : 0.38 and ratio of male &amp; female workers is 7989: 6193 i.e. almost 50 : 50. Now at this moment the ratio of working Degree &amp; Diploma Textile Engineer is 153: 1 46 i.e. almost 50:50.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Textile and Clothing sector is the largest sector in Bangladesh in respect to foreign currency earning and job creation. The sector is labor intensive and it is of low productivity; i.e., low value added per labor. It provides employment to about 50% of the work force of our country and contributes9.5 0f our total GDP. Commencing in 1980s, Bangladeshi T&amp;C sector has gained fame globally; in this category. It has established this position in this category since long; in the US and European markets. Present global financial meltdown is helping Bangladesh to enter in the stronger Asian market, namely- Japan. As soon as the global economy meltdown started, several features&amp; articles in different perspectives of T&amp;C sector of Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Bangladeshi Textile and Clothing (T&amp;C) Sector and Its possible prospect </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">All most all of the articles published so far have concluded, the present meltdown in global economy has good impact on our T&amp;C sector. Recently, also Bangladesh Bank has confidently disclosed positive impact of global financial turmoil on our T&amp;C sector. Global financial crisis pressurizes consumers of medium and high valued textile products absorb low value-added products. Bangladesh is undoubtedly leading in the low value- added category of T&amp;C items globally with its competitors China, India, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh captures only 3% of T&amp;C market of the global demand. But it is more than 76% of our total export figure. We export 85% clothing and 15% textile of total T&amp;C export.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Global clothing sector generally divided into three commodity chains. Bangladesh belongs to the bottom position with lowest value added unit price, dealing with mere assembling; so called mere assembling Manufacturer. Original Brand Manufacturer with highest value added unit is on the top of the commodity chain where Italy positioned and at the middle is original Equipment Manufacturer where Korea and Hong Kong enumerated. China belongs to both OEM and OBM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladeshi T&amp;C sector can be divided into 5 sub- sectors, which starts with Fiber Manufacturing, Yarn Manufacturing, Fabric Formation, Dyeing&amp; Printing and Clothing Manufacturing. Though belongs to MAM member, Bangladesh clothing sector has gained remarkable growth and becoming almost cent percent export- oriented. Bangladesh is one the five top clothing exporters in the world with annual export ofUS$12 billion. The reasons behind the growth of the T&amp;C industry are through international supports in various forms: MFA (Multi-Fiber agreement 1974-94), ATC (Agreement on Textile and Clothing 1995-05), and GSP (Generalized System Preferences) etc. In addition, local cheap and vast work force contributes remarkable growth of this industry. Our work force is 140% cheaper than that of China.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In literature’s ‘Garment and Clothing’ have their own meaning. Garments refer to the products that cover human body. Therefore, textile products, Leather products, Shoes, etc are garments. Clothing refers to finished piece of fabric that can be used for the purpose of human body or bed. Therefore, It is wise to use the word ‘Clothing Industry’ instead of ‘Garment Industry’ in Bangladesh Progressive Enhancement of export Performance: Every year the export figure of T&amp;C sector of Bangladesh is showing positive growth Therefore, the next year target is set- up about 16 billion US$ by EPB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Table 1: T&amp;C items export figures, its contribution and growth</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Year</td><td valign="top">Export in US$ (million)</td><td valign="top">Contribution to total exports</td><td valign="top">Growth Rate</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2003-04</td><td valign="top">5686.09</td><td valign="top">74,79</td><td valign="top">+15.76</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2004-05</td><td valign="top">6417.67</td><td valign="top">74.16</td><td valign="top">+12.87</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2005-06</td><td valign="top">7900.80</td><td valign="top">71,01</td><td valign="top">+23.11</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2006-07</td><td valign="top">9211.23</td><td valign="top">75.64</td><td valign="top">+16.59</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2007-08</td><td valign="top">10701.65</td><td valign="top">75,78</td><td valign="top">+16.19</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2008-09</td><td valign="top">12000.267</td><td valign="top">– – – –</td><td valign="top">+12.14</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Table 2: Comparing labor cost &amp; Energy cost with competitor countries.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Country</td><td valign="top">Labor cost</td><td valign="top">Energy cost</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bangladesh</td><td valign="top">US$0.25/hour</td><td valign="top">US$.07/KwH</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">India</td><td valign="top">US$0.60/hour</td><td valign="top">US$.095/KwH</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pakistan</td><td valign="top">US$0.40/hour</td><td valign="top">US$.08/KwH</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sri Lanka</td><td valign="top">US$0.45/hour</td><td valign="top">US$.096/KwH</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">China</td><td valign="top">US$o.35/hour</td><td valign="top">US$.080/KwH</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Positive and smooth export growth is directly contributing to build our local market of clothing. Within very short period, we have seen fast growth of local clothing brands and its outlets in different parts of Dhaka and other big metropolitan cities. There are more than 50 famous clothing brands; big and small size; in our country. Thereby directly &amp; indirectly; creating job for many educated, unskilled and semi skilled people. Many private fashion and clothing designing institutes have been set up in capital and in other big cities. As the T&amp;C export is contributing substantially more than any other sectors in the national economy, the government is going to introduce diploma education on fashion designing and clothing designing to strengthen this sector very soon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To bringing better idea and educational syllabus on these diploma education, the honorable Director General, Prof. Md. Abu Basher of Technical Educational Board of Bangladesh visited the most leading fashion institute of Europe in Germany. Positive export growth of items has made textile and clothing education most lucrative Most of the private universities are offering Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in textile Engineering, Diploma and B.Sc. Clothing Technology. Some universities are offering textile/clothing Master of Business Administration. Buying houses by local and foreign entrepreneurs for T&amp;C in Bangladesh have sprang up more than 1000 within very short time. These Buying houses contribute to about 70% of total T&amp;C export of the country. Every month 5-6 Buying Houses are coming into existence. Therefore, creating job opportunities for skilled and semi skilled manpower of the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Basic Structure of Bangladeshi Textile&amp; Clothing</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>Indirect export, local uses</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>Man made Fiber</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>M/c Spinning</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>M/c Spun Yarn</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>Hand spun Yarn</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>Hand Spinning</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>Traditional Looming</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>Traditional wet processing</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td>Traditional clothing mfg</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">1</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, our T&amp;C sector is in flourishing stage. Minimum one more decades is required for the sector to become fully flourished! Thereby, we can higher and higher export figures on T&amp;C. As our country would be fully flourished with T&amp;C export, work force development with employment saturation, our country could improve her status from least Developed Country to Developing Country. Past and present trends and positive performance strongly announce more and more T&amp;C units would be erected around Dhaka and Citation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rural areas, where numerous clothing labors are living through small production; like house- based clothing production cottages; could also come into account. When Dhaka and chittagong and its surrounding will be saturated in term of area shortage, then the rural areas would get priority by investors for installing T&amp;C industry or park. The first step for setting up clothing production unit must be in saidpur that is situated the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">northwest of Bangladesh And where there two production factors ie; land and labor are already existing .Only capital that is investor are required. However road and infrastructure Saidpur town are well electricity plant and EPZ, more than 15 different banks and internet facilities are present there.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After few years, when out T&amp;C sector would get matured in terms of quality production; skilled and educated persons might take the role of employers. Our T&amp;C industry consequently switches from low value- added items to medium and high value-added items. In other word, we change our status from ‘cut and paste’ to Original equipment Manufacturer. Then some premier clothing brands names may be found in our export lists. Now, mostly discounters of clothing chains consume clothing’s from Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, there is a consistent support from government to ensure working environment. Moreover, intelligent and smart policies and rules with importing countries, e-governance in banks, customs offices, clearing and Forwarding offices, etc are getting support of our government. Government should also create a monitoring board that would watch and recommend T&amp;C industries to be compliant with environment and social issues. In future, this T&amp;C sector would play an important role to revive jute and its industry. Our T&amp;C industry is only vertically integrated. But if the competition go intense; our producers have to have picked up newer way to compete. In other word , they pick horizontal integration. Therefore, the producers would compete through economics of scope.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Possible ways to Remain competitive in T&amp;C Sector: More R&amp;D and innovation for T&amp;C sector: There nothing better than continuous Research and Development to remain competitive in the global trade battle. Through R&amp;D new product development is possible which is the armored to remain competitive globally. We already proved ourselves most competitive in price of basic clothing products. We have to switch from low value-added items to medium and high value-added products through own clothing fashion and design.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Develop Higher Quality Education and Training: At present 70 institutes are involved to provide educations on T&amp;C fields, which includes vocational training, certificate courses, diploma and B.Sc. degrees. However, there emphasis on quality improvement is not adequate or of International standard. According to a survey of Bangladesh Quality Support Programmed (BQSP) T&amp;C requires more than 30,000 marketing personal 20,000 technically educated experts. ‘Quality Improvement’ based technical institutions are most necessary in the country. Only college of textile engineering and technology under Dhaka University has proved itself as the most effective institution to supply technical experts (textile engineers) while BIFT is contribution through producing technical knowledge- based clothing marketing</p><p style="text-align: justify;">human resources. However, quality and training of our exiting institutes need to be improved significantly</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Active common platform for T&amp;C sector: In Bangladesh there are two stakeholders of this sector namely BGMEA and BKMEA who are more active than earlier to build our T&amp;C industry less vulnerable and to promote the sector through seminars and exhibitions locally. These institutions along with German organization, GTZ, are trying to improve the overall scenario of this sector. Besides, there is a very active organization name ‘ITET’ (The institution of Textile Engineers and Technologist, Bangladesh) organized by textile engineers who is playing a very important role to improve the whole T&amp;C sector.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To improve our T&amp;C sector we need effective trade policies and compliance. With better trade policy we can have easy access to global market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh has a glorious background of Textile Industry and at present it is an important sector as more than 76% at the export earning comes from this sector. At present BTMA members have the highest investment about 9500 corer in the industrial sector at Bangladesh and Textile Sector employees about 27 ac people.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladesh at present there are 1 58 Spinning mills under BTMA. In Bangladesh, Spinning mills are fully capable of meeting the requirement of export quality knit fabric and about 20% at the woven fabric requirement for export oriented RMG industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As the export increased in the Knitwear sector, the capacity of backward linkage also gradually increased accordingly. The result is local suppliers can provide 90% of the total fabric requirement of the sector. The growth of spinning also stepped with the growth of knitwear exports. In 1 993-94 total number of spindles was 1 .38 million that supplied 1 0.70 million KG yarn. In 2003-04 the number almost tripled and it became 3.77 million that supplies 239.00 million KG yarn. As of now the total investment in the backward linkage industry is more than US$ 2.00 billion. At present, Bangladesh is facing challenge in the quota free world market. Hence Bangladesh must maintain quality in all respect in Textile Industry. This is way it is necessary to find out the present status of Textile Spinning Mills in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Period of Establishment</b>:</p><table border="1"

Though the textile industries of Bangladesh have exporting their products in the competitive wolrd market, R &amp; D phenomenon in textiles as a whole is not mentionable compared to our neighboring countries. In India Universities and research institute are conducting continuous research on textiles with a view to improving quality &amp; reducing the cost of products. In Bangladesh their prevails no such national university/ institutes expecting Bangladesh Jute Research Institute where only jute fibre is addressed. In this situation, national research institute on textiles is a crying need of the nation. Both public &amp; private sectors can come sorward to fill up the gap.Private institute may be pioneer in formulating a modern textiles research institute for having quality feedback of the technical problem in industry.</p></div></div>
9036	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">Textile Wastewater and its effect</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><a href="http://issuu.com/rose1990/docs/texttile_wastewater?mode=window&amp;viewMode=singlePage">View with images and charts</a></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Textile Wastewater and its effect</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major problems concerning textile wastewater is colored effluent. The discharge of color waste is not only damaging to the aesthetic nature of the receiving streams but also toxic aquatic life. In addition, color interferes with the transmission of sunlight into the stream and therefore reduces photosynthetic action. The color in the effluent is mainly due to unfixed dye. The concentration of unused dyes in the effluent depends upon the nature of dyes and dyeing process underway at the time (McMullan, et al., 2001). Inefficiency of dyeing process results in 10-25 % of all dye stuffs being lost directly to the wastewater (Perineau, et al., 1982). Although the textile dyes contribute only a small portion of the total volume of discharged wastewater after the dyeing process, yet they make it deeply colored (McKay, et al., 1985). Considerable work has been carried out on the removal of dye from wastewater (Perineau, et al., 1982; McKay, et al., 1985; Gupta, 1985; Khattri, 2000; Low, et al., 2000; Liversidge, et al., 1997; Choy, et al., 1999, Asilian, et al., 2006).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Water insoluble dyes (e.g. disperse and vat dyes) generally exhibit good exhaustion properties i.e. most of the dye bonds to the fiber and have been reported to be removed by physical means such as flocculation. When effluents containing these classes of dyes are discharged to a conventional sewage treatment works most of the color is removed by adsorption on biomass. However, since the introduction of water soluble dyes (reactive dyes), which are extensively used in the industry, conventional biological treatment processes such as the primary and secondary treatment systems are no longer able to achieve adequate color removal. The color of reactive dyes is due to the presence of N=N azo bonds and chromophoric groups. These dyes are first absorbed on the cellulose and then react with fiber by forming covalent bond between the dye molecule and the fiber. After fixation of the dyes on the fiber, about 10–50% of the initial loading is present in the dye bath effluent which gives rise to a highly colored effluent. Because of non-biodegradability due to chemical structure and molecular size they can create a problem in the environment. It is necessary, therefore, to use tertiary treatment to remove color before discharging the wastewater into natural streams.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adsorption appears to offer the best prospects over all the other techniques of dye removal at tertiary stage (Robinson, et al., 2001; Kamel, et al., 1991; Keith, et al., 1999; McKay, 1981). From literature survey, it is revealed that a number of biological adsorbents have been investigated for removing reactive dyes, these include amongst others; maize cob, wood and rice hull (Low et. al 1997). It is known that activated carbon is a versatile adsorbent because of its sufficient surface area, pore volume, high degree of surface reactivity and exhibits reasonable adsorption capacities for decolorants in aqueous solutions. Dye adsorption is enhanced because of the presence of mesopores together with micropores in the activated carbon. There are some commercially available active carbons but these are expensive (Bhattacharya et. Al 1984, Singh and Rawat 1994, McKay et. al. 1986, Khare et al. 1987).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now one aspect is that what technology is to be used for removing color. As more and more stringent regulations for industrial effluent deposition into water bodies are being applied, selection of a treatment method with high removal efficiencies for dyes and less operational problems is becoming inevitable. Liquid effluent treatment is commonly done in fixed beds for large-scale operation. However, fluidized bed or mechanically agitated suspensions are preferred for medium/small-scale ones. Another aspect to be considered is that wastewaters always contain suspended solids (e.g., fibers, waxes and gums), which clog fixed beds, requiring frequent backwashing or fluidization to dislodge the foreign material. Besides, fluidized bed technology can overcome the setbacks of the fixed bed treatment process by increasing adsorbent surface area, efficient mixing, and better contact of adsorbent and adsorbate. Typical problems encountered in fixed bed are dead zones, gas/vapor pockets, and channeling. In addition, pressure drops in fixed bed increases with the increase in flow rate causing high pumping cost compared to fluidized bed where pressure drop remains almost constant with increase in flow rate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Textile dyeing industry is an important labor-based, export orientated sector in Bangladesh. The full flourishment of this industry is significant for the country’s economy. In the dyeing industries, above 30-60 L of water are consumed per kg of cloth dyed and large quantities of the effluents are released during processing. It amounts to about 16% of the total water consumed in the factory (Denold 1984, Namasivayam et. al. 1994). Most of the factories have no effluent treatment plants. They are sometimes directly drained to the rivers or canals causing severe water pollution and in other cases they are treated to some extent but not enough vigorously, so that all the dissolved colored materials can be decreased below the tolerable limit. Human and ecological health concerns have prompted the government to require textile effluent discharges to have increasingly lower color and nitrogen levels. The removal of dye in an economic fashion, however, remains an important problem. Thus, despite being aware of the problem, many textile manufactures have failed to adequately remove azo dye compounds from their wastewaters. So in Bangladesh context an efficient but cost effective method for removal of colored materials from effluent is crucial. The current practice of a very few local industries who have undertaken tertiary stage water treatment is to use low grade activated carbon as single use adsorbent in a fixed bed and discard the spent for further use as fuel. To make such practice economically viable low-cost adsorbent as well as maximum utilization of it are necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While the research for low cost adsorbent and indigenously prepared activated carbon is going on (G. Mckay et. al. 1986, Mohammad et al, 2006), the present study is focusing on the performance of fluidized bed of activated carbon in decolorizing tertiary stage waste water.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.1 Objectives with Specific Aims and Outcome</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The objectives of this study are to investigate the followings:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ø Physical properties and adsorption characteristics of commercially available activated carbon</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ø Performance of a fluidized bed of activated carbon in removing colored materials from water</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ø Mass transfer characteristics of the fluidized bed</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With these specific aims in mind physical properties and equilibrium isotherm of granular activated carbon collected from Graphics Textiles Ltd. Sreerampur, Savar, Dhaka, Bangaldesh were investigated. The decolorizing performance of the fluidized bed is investigated by generating breakthrough curves. The breakthrough curves were obtained for dyed water prepared in the laboratory as well as industrial effluent collected from …at tertiary stage. Finally, based on the isotherm and breakthrough curves mass transfer analysis of the fluidized bed was carried out.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Literature Review</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Color is one of the characteristics of an effluent which is easily detected and readily traced back to source. Most of the dyes are stable to biological degradation. Color affects the nature of the water and inhibits sunlight penetration into the stream and reduces photosynthetic action. The primary concern about effluent color is not only its toxicity but also its undesirable aesthetic impact on receiving waters. Non-biodegradable nature of most of the dyes reducing aquatic diversity by blocking the passage of sunlight through the water represents serious problems to the environment. In some cases, dyes in low concentration are harmful to aquatic life. Since many dyes have adverse effect on human beings, the removal of color from the effluent or process has appeared of importance for ensuring healthy environment. It is pointed out that less than 1 ppm of dye content causes obvious water coloration [Allen et.al 1998].</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From an environmental point of view, for removal of dyes from wastewater, lots of research works have been done in the past and still are going on at present on stability of liquid solid of both fixed bed and fluidized bed technology. The reviews of some earlier research works related to the present investigation are presented below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.1 Color removal efficiency </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The textile finishing industry generates a large amount of wastewater. Wastewaters from dyeing and subsequent rinsing steps form one of the largest contributions to wastewater generation in the textile industry. Because dyes are almost invariably toxic, their removal from effluent stream is ecologically necessary. Reactive dyes pose the greatest problem in terms of color, which is exacerbated by the dominance of cotton in today’s fashion industry. The human eye can detect concentrations of 0.005 mg/L of reactive dye in water, and therefore, presence of dye exceeding this limit would not be permitted on aesthetic grounds (Pierce, 1994). After the reactive dyeing process is complete, up to 800 mg/l of hydrolyzed dye remains in the bath (Steankenrichter and Kermer, 1992). Fixation rates for reactive dyes tend to be in the range of 60–70% although the values tend to be higher in dyes containing two reactive groups (Carr, 1995). Therefore, up to 40% of the color is discharged in the effluent from reactive dyeing operation resulting in a highly colored effluent. An additional problem is that the reactive dyes in both ordinary and hydrolyzed forms are not easily biodegradable, and thus, even after extensive treatment, color may still remain in the effluent. The conventional processes such as coagulation, flocculation and biological methods adopted for decolorizing effluents containing reactive dyes are no longer able to achieve an adequate color removal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2 Adsorbents for color removal</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adsorption methods have been invariably successful to decolorize textile effluents but according to the Santhy (2005) this application is limited by the high cost of adsorbents. The removal efficiency of activated carbon prepared from coir pith towards three highly used reactive dyes in textile industry was investigated. Batch experiments showed that the adsorption of dyes increased with an increase in contact time and carbon dose. Maximum decolorization of all the dyes was observed at acidic pH. Adsorption of dyes was found to follow the Freundlich model. The column experiments using granular form of the carbon (obtained by agglomeration with polyvinyl acetate) showed that adsorption efficiency increased with an increase in bed depth and decrease of flow rate. The bed depth service time (BDST) analysis carried out for the dyes indicated a linear relationship between bed depth and service time. The exhausted carbon could be completely regenerated and put to repeated use by elution with 1.0 M NaOH. The coir pith activated carbon was not only effective in removal of color but also significantly reduced COD levels of the textile wastewater.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">G. McKay et. al (1985) removed color by using some low cost materials. The low-cost materials can be used once and discarded by burning them. A variety of materials are reported in the literature for adsorption of different pollutants. Tree bark, coal, cotton waste, clay, hair etc., have been reported to adsorb different pollutants like heavy metals, pesticides, phosphates and sulphates, viruses etc. Since low-cost materials have been tried to remove different types of pollutants in different ionic forms, experiments were conducted to assess the feasibility of six low-cost materials to adsorb various types of dyes. He represents a number of low-cost materials (teakwood bark, ricehusk, coal, bentonite clay, hair and cotton waste) have been used as adsorbents for dyestuffs in aqueous solutions. Four red and four blue dyes have been studied; each color group consisted of an acidic, a basic, a disperse and a direct dye. The equilibrium isotherm for each dye-adsorbent system was determined and an adsorption capacity from zero to 200 mg dye g<sup>-1</sup> of adsorbent was obtained. In general basic dyes adsorbed to a greater extent than the other dye classes but no single characteristic of the dye or adsorbent seemed responsible for such dye-adsorbent interactions and adsorption capacities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">M. EL Guend et.al (1986) has been studied the adsorption of four dyestuffs, namely, Basic Blue 69 (BB69), Basic Red 22 (BR22), Acid Red 114 (AR114) and Acid Blue 25 (AB25), onto bagasse pith. Bagasse pith is a cheap, abundant waste product from the sugar industry in Egypt and was found to have the following monolayer equilibrium saturation capacities: 158, 77, 23 and 22 mg dye/g pith. The effects of pith particle size range and dye solution temperature were studied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ahsan Habib et.al (2006) used tuberose sticks as an adsorbent for the removal of dyes present in industrial effluents. Methylene blue was selected as a model dye as an attempt to use waste tuberose sticks as an adsorbent for the removal of dye from wastewaters. The use of low-cost and eco-friendly adsorbents has been investigated as an ideal alternative to the current expensive methods of removing dyes from wastewater. Methylene Blue was used as model compound. The effects of contact time, initial dye concentration (20, 30, 40, 50 mg/L), pH and adsorbent dosages have been studied at 25 °C. The equilibrium time was found to be 30 min for all the dye concentrations. A maximum removal of 80% was obtained at pH 11.0 for an adsorbent dose 50 mg/50 mL of 40 mg/L dye concentration. Adsorption increased with increase in pH. Maximum desorption of 50% was achieved in water medium at pH 2.0.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is a growing interest in using low cost, commercially available materials for the adsorption of dye colors. A wide variety of low cost materials, such as clay minerals, bagasse pith, wood, maize cob and peat are being tried as viable substitutes for activated carbon to remove dyes from colored effluents. That’s why Nassar and Magdy (1996) studied the adsorption of three basic dyes (basic yellow, basic red and basic blue) from an aqueous solution on palm-fruit bunch particles. The experimental results indicate that maximum adsorption capacities of the palm-fruit bunch particles were found to be 327 mg yellow dye per gram of adsorbent, 180 mg red dye per gram of adsorbent and 92 mg blue dye per gram of adsorbent. A comparative case study, based on the adsorption capacity alone, has shown that the costs of the adsorbent required are 1.9%, 4.4% and 7.1% respectively, compared with the case of commercial activated carbon granules.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Nigam et. al (2000) the release of dyes into the environment constitutes only a small proportion of water pollution, but dyes are visible in small quantities due to their brilliance. Tightening government legislation is forcing textile industries to treat their waste effluent to an increasingly high standard. Currently, removal of dyes from effluents is by physio-chemical means. Such methods are often very costly and although the dyes are removed, accumulation of concentrated sludge creates a disposal problem. There is a need to find alternative treatments that are effective in removing dyes from large volumes of effluents and are low in cost, such as biological or combination systems. This article reviews the current available technologies and suggests an effective, cheaper alternative for dye removal and decolorization applicable on large.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3 Adsorption in Fixed bed</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of fixed bed adsorption one of the more successful simple modeling methods is the bed depth service time (BDST) model of hutchins (1973). This model assumed a linear relationship between the bed depth and the service time required for a chosen percentage content of impurity to reach the selected breakpoint in the bed. This model was applied to several fixed bed studies for the adsorption of various dyestuffs onto chitin by McKay et al.4 with considerable success. However, the model does not consider the mass transport kinetics of the adsorption process and therefore is limited in accuracy to the data under investigation and great care must be adopted in extending this model to predict design data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, Mckay, Blair and Gradner (1986) has been developed a model. The model is based on external mass transport a pore diffusion, which is controlled by an effective diffusion coefficient. The model has been tested using experimental data obtained for the adsorption of Acid Blue 25 on chitin. Chitin has the ability to adsorb substantial quantities of dyestuffs from aqueous solutions. Hence, it may be a useful adsorbent for effluent treatment from textile mills. Mckay, Blair and Gradner (1984) investigate also the design procedures for batch and continuous fixed bed adsorption columns have been investigated for four dyestuffs. Batch type process are usually limited to the treatment of small volumes of effluent, but small adsorbent particle sizes may be used hence large external surface areas are available for mass transfer. Fixed bed systems, however, would sustain high pressure drop losses if fine adsorbent particles were used, but they have an advantage because adsorption depends on the concentration of solute in the solution being treated. The adsorbent is continuously in contact with fresh solution; hence the concentration in the solution in contact with a given layer of adsorbent in a column is relatively constant. Conversely, the concentration of solute in contact with a given quantity of adsorbent is continuously changing due to the solute being adsorbed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Walker and Weatherley (1997) shown the reduction in effluent color produced by acid dyestuffs. This work involved the treatment of industrial wastewater from a nylon-carpet printing plant in Northern Ireland which currently receives no treatment and is discharged straight to sea. As nylon is particularly difficult to dye, acid dyes are required for successful coloration, but they cause major problems with the plant’s effluent disposal. Granular activated carbon Filtrasorb 400 was used to treat this effluent in a fixed-bed column system. Breakthrough curves from the fixed-bed column were shallow, even at low flow rates, which indicated a large mass transfer zone and inefficient use of adsorbent. Decrease in adsorbent particle size and decrease in linear flow rate produced a better bed performance. The bed depth service time (BDST) model proved effective for comparison of column variables, with calculated BDST constants providing a useful indication of bed performance. The BDST model also gave good approximation in predicting a bed performance using the relationships postulated by Hutchins (1973).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the other side Arvind Varma and Dmitrios Chatzipoulos (1994) investigates the aqueous-phase adsorption and desorption of toluene in Filtrasorb-300 (F-300) activated carbon fixed-bed adsorbers at 25°C under a wide range of operating conditions. Process dynamics were described successfully using a homogeneous surface diffusion model with external mass transfer and a surface diffusion coefficient that increases with surface coverage. The model also accounted for irreversible toluene adsorption on F-300. The adsorption isotherm parameters, the surface diffusion coefficient and its dependence on surface concentration were determined independently in batch adsorption studies. The value of the external mass transfer coefficient as a function of the Reynolds number was determined by fitting the adsorption breakthrough curves. The fraction of irreversible toluene adsorption as a function of initial surface loading was found from the desorption breakthrough curves. Use of these independently measured equilibrium and transport parameters in the model permitted the successful description of experimental rates of toluene adsorption and desorption in F-300 fixed beds under a variety of operating conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.4 Adsorption on Activated Carbon: Comparative studies in a fixed bed and fluidized bed</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For removal of color at tertiary level treatment adsorption on a fixed or packed bed of activated carbon is much popular, due to the properties of activated carbon of high organic color removal capacity. Though with activated carbon both organic and inorganic dyestuff can be adsorbed but it is more efficient in removing the organic color as it is an organic substance itself. The dyestuff or colored materials get adsorbed on the surface by external mass transfer and when the surface gets covered with adsorbate, the adsorption rate decreases as internal mass transfer is slower due to complicated process path of inside molecular structure. So after a certain period the activated carbon loses the ability of further adsorption and then it has to be either regenerated, which is still a difficult and expensive process or it has to be replaced by new activated carbon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are some difficulties faced in the operation of fixed or packed bed, such as:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Clogging, channeling, gas/vapor pocket and dead zone may be created inside the bed, which reduces the flow and make it nonuniform, thus decreases adsorption rate. More over large pressure drop and non uniform temperature has to be often faced in fixed bed operation. These set backs of fixed bed operation can be overcome by fluidized bed operation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Advantages of using Fluidized bed adsorption process over fixed bed adsorption:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1 Adsorption surface area increases due to fluidization, more free adsorption sites become reachable to the adsorbate</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2 Efficient mixing and good contact between adsorbent and adsorbate is ensured</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3 Pressure drop is almost constant and thus required pumping energy does not vary</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4 Temperature in the system can assumed to be uniform or constant</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5 No clogging or channeling takes place</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6 Dead zone, gas/ vapor pocket creation inside the bed can also be avoided.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.5 Adsorption in Fluidized bed</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liquid effluent treatment in fluidized beds has received limited attention as adsorption onto activated carbon is commonly done in fixed beds for large-scale operation. But for the advantages of applying fluidized bed technology over fixed bed have drawn attentions of researchers for several years and research is still going on the industrial application of this process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adsorption with activated carbon is widely employed for the removal of organics in water purification. Several adsorber configurations are possible for treatment with activated carbon; these include batch vessel, continuous flow stirred tank, fixed bed, moving bed, and fluidized bed [e.g. Gulp et al. (1978)]. Traditionally, the treatment of choice has been packed-bed adsorption due to the ease and reliability of this operation. Nevertheless, several problems, such as excessive head loss, air binding, and fouling with biological and particulate matter are associated with packed-bed operation. These problems are significantly reduced in fluidized-bed adsorption; hence, Veeraraghavan, Fan and Mathews (1989) have focused on this mode of operation. Under certain conditions, the breakthrough time in a fluidized-bed adsorber is considerably shorter than that in a comparable fixed-bed adsorber. This phenomenon is probably due to the appreciable macro scale or axial mixing occurring in the solid and liquid phases of the fluidized bed. An axial dispersion model has been adapted to characterize the fluidized bed adsorber. The model takes into account the effects of axial mixing in the solid and liquid phases, mass transfer resistance in the laminar fluid boundary surrounding an individual adsorbent particle, and diffusional resistance within the particle. The model has been solved numerically to simulate the performance of a laboratory-scale adsorber. The results of the simulation closely represent experimental observations over wide ranges of the influent flow rate, fluidized bed height and adsorbent particle size.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gordan Mckay (1988) studied the fluidized bed adsorption of pollutants onto activated carbon. The pollutants were phenol, p-chlorophenol and sodium dodecyl sulphate, and the effects of the flow rate of the solution and of the pollutant concentration have been studied. He have shown the correlations between the external mass transfer coefficient k<sub>f</sub> and the liquid-phase Reynolds number and Analysis of the kinetic data seems to indicate that both external and internal mass transfer coefficients are rate controlling.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Correa et al (2006) developed a fluidized bed system for adsorption of phenol from aqueous solutions. This work is related to removal of phenol from wastewaters by adsorption onto polymeric resins, a current alternative to activated carbon. A closed circuit, bench-scale liquid fluidized bed system was developed for this purpose. Phenol aqueous solutions with initial concentrations in the range of 0.084 to 0.451 kg/m3 were used to fluidize small permeable capsules of stainless steel screen containing a commercial resin at 308 K. Experiments were carried out using a fluidizing velocity 20% above that of the minimum fluidization of the capsules. Typically, 30 passages of the liquid volume circulating through the bed were required to reach a quasi-equilibrium concentration of phenol in the treated effluent. A simple batch adsorption model using the Freundlich isotherm successfully predicted final phenol concentrations. Suspended solids, often present in residual waters and a common cause of fixed bed clogging, were simulated with wood sawdust.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Kargi and Eyiisleyen (1995) investigated the kinetics of biological removal of COD and nitrogen from a synthetic wastewater in a fluidized bed operating in batch mode. Synthetic wastewater consisted of diluted molasses, urea, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and MgSO<sub>4</sub>, resulting in COD/N/P = 100/l0/2. The fluidized bed contained sponge particles surrounded by stainless-steel wires as support particles for microorganisms, The system was operated with different initial COD and nitrogen concentrations, and COD-nitrogen consumption profiles were obtained. From the initial slopes of these curves, the initial rates of COD and nitrogen consumption and kinetic constants were determined. The system operated under a COD limitation with no dissolved oxygen limitations. The kinetic analysis for COD removal has shown a Monod type of kinetics with possible inhibition on the K<sub>s</sub> term. Nitrogen removal rate data indicated an inhibition for nitrogen concentrations above 1,200 mg/l</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wang et. Al (1996) analyzed the performance of granular activated carbon in a liquid-solid fluidized bed to remove phenols. Although the use of activated carbon for treatment of water and wastewater has received a lot of interest, the fundamental kinetic study of the adsorption process should be considered in advance. For an efficient adsorption process, the kinetic study provides the rapid removal of pollutants from solution and the adsorption equilibrium is the ultimate capacity for adsorption. Several physical configurations of adsorbers are available for activated carbon adsorption, e.g. batch vessel, continuous stirred tank, fixed bed and fluidized bed. Fluidized-bed operation has the advantage that the particles are in continuous motion with efficient mixing of the fluid, but suffers from particle attrition and erosion. Successful design of a fluidized-bed adsorption column requires the prediction of the effluent concentration time profile, i.e. the breakthrough curve.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.6 Kinetics of adsorption on activated carbon</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adsorption on activated carbon is one of the most effective and dependable technologies currently available for the treatment of drinking water and wastewaters contaminated with low concentrations of hazardous compounds (Irvin 1993). The role of activated carbon in effective water pollution control is well established. The rate of adsorption on activated carbon from a liquid phase is rather slow. The removal of man-made pollutants often is the predominant goal of adsorption by granular activated carbon in waste water treatment. As a cost consideration, granular activated carbon is much cheaper than the powdered form (Wang, R. et. Al 1996).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liquid-phase adsorption has been shown to be highly efficient for removal of colors, odors, organic and inorganic matter from process or waste effluents. Activated carbons (granular or powdered) are widely used adsorbents because of their excellent adsorption capability for organic pollutants (Juang et. al. 2000). Fettig and Sontheimer [1987] investigate the adsorption kinetics of a variety of single substances on activated carbon is investigated a low liquid-phase concentrations. Experimental data they have obtained by the mini column method show the influence of dissociation and molecular weight of the adsorbates o their external mass transfer behavior. Modeling of mini column breakthrough curves proves the internal mass transport resistances have to be taken into account at low concentrations as well as high. A differential fixed-bed reactor technique was used to determine intraparticle mass transport parameters. For strongly adsorbate substances, diffusion in the adsorbend phase proves to be prevailing, whereas for weakly adsorbable or high molecular weight assorbates, pore diffusion also contributes to the internal mass transport. However the surface diffusivities depend on the carbon loading in an adsorbate-specific manner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Kannan and Sundaram [2001] have been using activated carbon which is come from various indigenously prepared activated carbons from agricultural wastes and to compare their adsorption capacity for the removal of methylene blue under optimum experimental conditions. The effects of various experimental parameters have been investigated using a batch adsorption technique to obtain information on treating effluents from the dye industry. The kinetics of adsorption were found to be first order with regard to intra-particle diffusion rate. The adsorption capacities of indigenous activated carbons have been compared with that of the commercial activated carbon. The results indicate that such carbons could be employed as low cost alternatives to commercial activated carbon in wastewater treatment for the removal of colour and dyes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sakoda, Nomura and Suzuki (1996) used activated carbon membrane which is to be used in water treatments was developed and the decolorization of the coke furnace wastewater was successfully demonstrated as a model case. The activated carbon membrane was prepared by carbonizing poly-vinylydenchloride (PVdC) and poly-vinylalcohol (PVA) microspheres aggregating on and within a ceramic pipe. The membrane developed in this work was suspected to have a bidispersed structure, which made it possible to play the roles of both a porous membrane having the molecular weight cut-off of about 10,000 and an activated carbon bed where the dissolved organics with low molecular weight could be adsorbed. The activated carbon membrane developed in this work appears to be useful for compact water treatment processes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mansi(1996) using sawdust as an adsorbent in a fixed bed adsorber for decolorizing wastewater. Fuller’s earth and bauxite were found to be successful as adsorbents for color removal on a laboratory scale, but considerable flow problems were encountered in a fixed bed system. Mc.kay et. al. investigate the removal of basic astrazone blue from effluents using silica gel as an adsorbents. Investigations by Mckay et. al. were made to determine whether cheap, commercially available materials hold promise in the treatment of wastewater. Their initial findings indicated that peat wood has a high adsorptive capacity for dyes and is relatively cheap. The cheapness of the adsorbent means that regeneration is not necessary and the spent adsorber can be burned. The batch adsorption is usually limited to the treatment of small volumes of effluent, whereas a fixed bed flow systems has an advantage because the solute concentration is changing continuously while the solute is being adsorbed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hak Lee et. al (2006) have been used zinc chloride treated indigenous activated carbon. The adsorption of colored compounds from the textile dyeing effluents of Bangladesh on granulated activated carbons produced from indigenous vegetable sources by chemical activation with zinc chloride was studied. The most important parameters in chemical activation were found be the chemical ratio of ZnCl2 to feed (3:1), carbonization temperature (450–465 ?C) and activation time (80 min). It is observed that adsorption of reactive dyes by all sorts of activated carbons is higher than disperse dyes. It is explained that activated carbon, because of its acidic nature, can better adsorb reactive dye particles containing large number of nitrogen sites and –SO3Na group in their structure. The use of carbons would be economical, as saw-dust and water hyacinth are waste products and abundant in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Granular activated carbon is the most popular adsorbent and has been used with great success (McKay, 1982), but is expensive. Consequently, new materials as chitin (McKay, 1982), silica gel (McKay et al., 1980), natural clay (El-Geundi, 1991, 1993a, b), bagasse pith (McKay, 1998) are being studied. A very limited amount of information is available on the use of natural zeolites as a method for dye removal (Meshko et al., 1999). So Meshko studied the adsorption of basic dyes from aqueous solution onto granular activated carbon and natural zeolite using an agitated batch adsorber</p><p style="text-align: justify;">S. J. Allen (1999) describes the adsorption capacities for anionic reactive dyes, namely Remazol Yellow, Remazol Red and Remazol Black B were determined using Filtrasorb 400 activated carbon. F-400 was selected because of its high adsorption capacity for a large number of contaminants in aqueous solutions. Competitive adsorption for reactive dyes in a mixture was investigated to test the efficiency of the activated carbon for purifying real effluent containing dyes. Chemical surface properties for F-400, including surface acidity, surface basicity, H+ and OH- adsorption capacities as well as the zero point of charge of the carbon (pH<sub>ZPC</sub>) were estimated. pH<sub>ZPC</sub> is a critical value for determining quantitatively the net charge (positive or negative) carried on the activated carbon surface during adsorption of reactive dyes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ahsan Habib et. at. (2006) have been used tuberose, the low-cost and ecofriendly adsorbent as an ideal alternative to the current expensive methods of removing dyes from wastewater. Methylene Blue was used as model compound. The effects of contact time, initial dye concentration (20, 30, 40, 50 mg/L), pH and adsorbent dosages have been studied at 25 °C. The equilibrium time was found to be 30 min for all the dye concentrations. A maximum removal of 80% was obtained at pH 11.0 for an adsorbent dose 50 mg/50 mL of 40 mg/L dye concentration. Adsorption increased with increase in pH. Maximum desorption of 50% was achieved in water medium at pH 2.0.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">McKay, Blair and Gardner (1983) studied the intraparticle diffusion processes for the adsorption of dyestuffs onto chitin. The amount of dye adsorbed per gram of chitin has been plotted against the square root of time. Sometimes two and even three linear regions are apparent on the root time plots indicating a possible branched pore mechanism. The controlling mechanisms are due to macropores and micropores in the chitin particle creating rapidly and slowly diffusing regions. McKay, Otturburn and Sweeney (1979) have been used Sorbsil silica as an adsorbent and the rate of adsorption of Astrazone Blue, a basic dye, on Sorbsil Silica has been studied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yang and Sun using peat–resin particle as a adsorbent for the adsorption of basic dyes from aqueous solution. Peat, as an adsorbent, is porous and rather complex material, containing lignin and cellulose. Recently, peat has been used to remove some pollutants (such as heavy metals, dyes and oil) from aqueous solution [ Coupa et. al.1976, McKay et. al. 1980, Couillard 1921 and Couillard 1994]. Many studies showed peat could effectively remove the dyes from aqueous solution. Peat can effectively remove the pollutants from solution and is inexpensive. However, when raw peat is directly used in wastewater treatment, there are many limitations, such as low chemical stability and mechanical strength, leach of fulvic acid from peat and difficult regeneration. In order to overcome these limitations, they prepared the modified peat–resin particle by mixing modified-peat with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and formaldehyde. The modified peat–resin particle contains polar functional groups, such as alcohols and acids. Both modified peat and resin in particle can adsorb the dyes from solution. Finally they analyze the adsorption isotherm and kinetics experiments of basic dyes (Basic Magenta and basic Brilliant Green) were conducted and the different kinetic models were used to analyze adsorption processes of basic dyes on modified peat–resin particle.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.7 Mass transfer in fluidized bed in case of wastewater treatment</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mass transfer in fluidized beds has been studied because of its fundamental importance in many engineering operations. Many experimental studies of the mass transfer in fluidized beds have been reported in the past 40 years (Garim et. at. 1999). Packed bed has disadvantages of low mass-transfer coefficient, large pressure drop, bed clogging, and therefore, periodic operation. It is a semi-batch process with low water treatment capacity. Fluidized bed partially overcomes these problems. Fluidization of bed increases the mass transfer coefficient and therefore, water treatment capacity. It also partly eliminates bed clogging. But, it is still a semi batch process and needs periodic operation to replace the saturated adsorbent with fresh adsorbent in the bed (Kishore and Verma 2005).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wright and Glasser (2000) have developed a model and solved to describe phenol adsorption in a fluidized bed. Liquid-solid mass transfer, adsorption and hydrodynamic effects were taken into account. The model was examined for both pore and homogeneous diffusion. Parametric sensitivity analysis showed that superficial velocity and particle radius had the largest effects on breakthrough behavior for all conditions. The effect of axial dispersion, film mass transfer and solid diffusion coefficients were less significant contributors to breakthrough at all expansions and bulk phase viscosities. The simulation results for pore diffusion were affected more significantly by changes in superficial velocity and particle radius than the simulation results for homogeneous diffusion. The performance of the fluidized-bed adsorption unit was limited by intraparticle mass-transfer effects, especially at high degrees of bed expansion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Kishore and Verma (2005) developed a counter current multi-stage fluidized bed ion exchanger to study mass transfer during the continuous removal of dissolved anions from wastewater using commercially available resin. OH ion is used as an example in the study. A higher removal efficiency in the multi-stage fluidized bed than in a single-stage fixed and fluidized bed is demonstrated. The experiment shows progressive fluidization on a stage, smooth flow of resin across the stage and transfer of resin from one stage to the other. In each stage of the fabricated four-stage perspex made column, a downspout has been provided to facilitate the downward flow of resin on to the next stage, while water flows counter currently upward through the mesh of the stage. In addition, provision has been made to adjust the down comer height on the stage without disturbing the operation with the aid of the rack and pinion arrangement. The experimental variables in the multi-stage column operated under steady state includes the flow rates of water and resin, feed concentration, stage height and the number of stages. A mathematical model is also developed for determining the key parameters that affect the overall mass transfer in the multi-stage continuous counter current column. In general, number of stages and diffusional resistance on the resin side control the extent of separation in the column</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mckay, G. et. al (1989) have investigated the external mass transfer during adsorption of various pollutants onto activated carbon. He explores a wide range of experimental studies which are reported for the adsorption of phenol and p-chlorophenol onto activated carbon–Type Filtrasorb 400–in an agitated batch adsorber. A model has been used to determine the external mass transfer coefficient for the systems and the effects of several experimental variables have been investigated: these include agitation, initial pollutant concentration, carbon mass, carbon particle size and solution temperature. The mass transfer coefficient has been correlated in terms of the dimensionless Sh/Sc<sup>0.33</sup> against each variable. The Sherwood number relates the external mass transfer coefficient k/ to particle radius, R, and molecular diffusivity. The Schmidt number, Sc, is the ratio of kinematic viscosity, v, to molecular diffusivity. A few results are also reported for the adsorption of sodium dodecyl sulphate and mercuric ions onto activated carbon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Mc.kay et. al (1989) several steps can be used to explain the mechanism of solute adsorption onto an adsorbent. However, for the purposes of the present work the overall adsorption process is assumed to occur using a three step model:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) Mass transfer of solute from the bulk solution to the particle surface;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(ii) Adsorption of solute onto sites;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(iii) Internal diffusion of solute via either a pore diffusion model or a homogeneous solid phase diffusion model.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the present work it has been assumed that step (ii) is rapid with respect to the other two processes and therefore is not rate limiting in any kinetic analysis. Consequently, the two controlling factors are film mass transfer and internal mass transfer. The development of models based on two such mass transport steps is quite complex, requiring a coupling equation and its subsequent solution. Initially, therefore simplifying assumptions were made and attempts to describe the adsorption processes in terms of either a film mass transfer coefficient of an internal diffusion mass transfer parameter have been undertaken. That’s why Mckay, Bino and Altamemi (1989) determined a single resistance model which has been developed enabling the external mass transfer coefficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mckay, Blair and Gardener (1984) have developed Two-Resistance Mass Transfer Model for the Adsorption of Various Dyestuffs onto Chitin. The mass transfer model is based on the assumption of a pseudoirreversible isotherm and two resistances to mass transfer. These are external mass transfer and internal pore diffusion mass transfer. The rate of adsorption of dyestuffs onto chitin can thus be described by an external mass transfer coefficient and a pore diffusion coefficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 1988 McKay, Geundi, and Wahab described two resistance mass transfer model for describing the adsorption of four dyes from aqueous solutions onto bagasse pith, a waste product from the sugar industry. The dyes studied are Basic Blue 69, Basic Red 22, Acid Blue 25 and Acid Red 114 and the system variables are initial dye concentration and pith mass. A method has been presented for the prediction of concentration decay vs time. The model is based on external mass transfer and pore diffusion and enables the external transport coefficients and the effective diffusivities to be determined. Constant mass transport coefficients were obtained for each dye-pith system to correlate the effects of varying the initial dye concentration and pith mass.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.8 Adsorption isotherms</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The distribution of dye between the adsorbent and dye solution, when the system is at equilibrium, is important to obtain the capacity of the granular activated carbon for the dyes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A number of equations exist which enable the equilibrium data to be correlated and two most frequently used, for dilute solutions, are the Langmuir</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and Freundlich isotherms equations which will discussed here. The parameters of these equations are very useful for predicting adsorption capacities and also for incorporating into mass transfer relationships in the design of contacting equipment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These two equations are used more than 99% of the time to describe the equilibrium adsorption of solutes to activated carbon. The reason is simple: in almost every case, one of these two equations fits the data quite well. Thus, there is no need for more elaborate isotherm equations, particularly those involving two or more parameteres.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.8.1 Adsorption</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adsorption is the accumulation of atoms or molecules on the surface of a material. This process creates a film of the adsorbate (the molecules or atoms being accumulated) on the adsorbent’s surface. It is different from absorption, in which a substance diffuses into a liquid or solid to form a solution. The term sorption encompasses both processes, while desorption is the reverse process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adsorption is present in many natural physical, biological, and chemical systems, and is widely used in industrial applications such as activated charcoal, synthetic resins, and water purification. Adsorption, ion exchange, and chromatography are sorption processes in which certain adsorbates are selectively transferred from the fluid phase to the surface of insoluble, rigid particles suspended in a vessel or packed in a column.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to surface tension, adsorption is a consequence of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent, or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms on the surface of the adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.8.2 Isotherm</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adsorption is usually described through isotherms, that is, the amount of adsorbate on the adsorbent as a function of its pressure (if gas) or concentration (if liquid) at constant temperature. The quantity adsorbed is nearly always normalized by the mass of the adsorbent to allow comparison of different materials.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first mathematical fit to an isotherm was published by Freundlich and Küster (1894) and is a purely empirical formula for gaseous adsorbates,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">……….(1)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">where q* is the quantity adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent, <i>P<sup>*</sup> </i> is the pressure of adsorbate and A and <i>n</i> are empirical constants for each adsorbent-adsorbate pair at a given temperature. The function has an asymptotic maximum as pressure increases without bound. As the temperature increases, the constants A and <i>n</i> change to reflect the empirical observation that the quantity adsorbed rises more slowly and higher pressures are required to saturate the surface.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.8.2.1 Freundlich equation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Freundlich equation or Freundlich adsorption isotherm is an adsorption isotherm, which is a curve relating the concentration of a solute on the surface of an adsorbent, to the concentration of the solute in the liquid with which it is in contact. There are basically two well established types of adsorption isotherm: the Freundlich adsorption isotherm and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Freündlich Adsorption Isotherm is mathematically expressed as</p><p style="text-align: justify;">………. (1)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">………. (2)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">where</p><p style="text-align: justify;">p = Equilibrium pressure of adsorbate</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C = Equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in solution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A and n are constants for a given adsorbate and adsorbent at a particular temperature</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.8.2.2 Langmuir equation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Langmuir equation or Langmuir isotherm or Langmuir adsorption equation relates the coverage or adsorption of molecules on a solid surface to gas pressure or concentration of a medium above the solid surface at a fixed temperature. The equation was developed by Irving Langmuir in 1916. The equation is stated as:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">……….. (3)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? or theta is the fractional coverage of the surface, P is the gas pressure or concentration, ? alpha is a constant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The constant ? is the Langmuir adsorption constant and increases with an increase in the binding energy of adsorption and with a decrease in temperature.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equation Derivation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The equation is derived starting from the equilibrium between empty surface sites (S * ), particles (P) and filled particle sites (SP)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">………….(4)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Equilibrium constant K is thus given by the equation:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">………… (5)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Because the number of filled surface sites (SP) is proportional to ?, the number of unfilled sites (S *) is proportional to 1-?, and the number of particles is proportional to the gas pressure or concentration (P) the equation can be rewritten as:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">…….. (6)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">where ? is a constant</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rearranging this:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? = ?(1 ? ?)P</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? = P? ? P??</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? + P?? = P?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">?(1 + P?) = P?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">……….. (7)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>[Equation Fitting</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Langmuir equation is expressed here as:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">…………….(8)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">where K = Langmuir equilibrium constant, C<sup>*</sup> = aqueous concentration (or gaseous partial pressure), = amount adsorbed, and = maximum amount adsorbed as c increases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The equilibrium constant is actually given by :</p><p style="text-align: justify;">…………..(9)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Langmuir equation can be fitted to data by linear regression and nonlinear regression methods. Commonly used linear regression methods are: Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, Scatchard, and Langmuir.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The double reciprocal of the Langmuir equation yields the Lineweaver-Burk equation:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">…………(10)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A plot of (1/) versus (1/c) yields a slope = 1/(K) and an intercept = 1/. The Lineweaver-Burk regression is very sensitive to data error and it is strongly biased toward fitting the data in the low concentration range. It was proposed in 1934. Another common linear form of the Langmuir equation is the Eadie-Hofstee equation:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">…………….(11)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A plot of () versus (/c) yields a slope = -1/K and an intercept =. The Eadie-Hofstee regression has some bias toward fitting the data in the low concentration range. It was proposed in 1942 and 1952. Another rearrangement yields the Scatchard regression:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">……….(12)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A plot of (/c) versus () yields a slope = -K and an intercept = K. The Scatchard regression is biased toward fitting the data in the high concentration range. It was proposed in 1949. Note that if you invert the x and y axes, then this regression would convert into the Eadie-Hofstee regression discussed earlier. The last linear regression commonly used is the Langmuir linear regression proposed by Langmuir himself in 1918:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">………….(13)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A plot of (c/) versus (c) yields a slope = 1/and an intercept = 1/(K). This regression is often erroneously called the Hanes-Woolf regression. The Hanes-Woolf regression was proposed in 1932 and 1957 for fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation, which is similar in form to the Langmuir equation. Nevertheless, Langmuir proposed this linear regression technique in 1918, and it should be referred to as the Langmuir linear regression when applied to adsorption isotherms. The Langmuir regression has very little sensitivity to data error. It has some bias toward fitting the data in the middle and high concentration range.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are two kinds of nonlinear least squares (NLLS) regression techniques that can be used to fit the Langmuir equation to a data set. They differ only on how the goodness-of-fit is defined. In the v-NLLS regression method, the best goodness-of-fit is defined as the curve with the smallest vertical error between the fitted curve and the data. In the n-NLLS regression method, the best goodness-of-fit is defined as the curve with the smallest normal error between the fitted curve and the data. Using the vertical error is the most common form of NLLS regression criteria. Definitions based on the normal error are less common. The normal error is the error of the datum point to the nearest point on the fitted curve. It is called the normal error because the trajectory is normal (that is, perpendicular) to the curve.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is a common misconception to think that NLLS regression methods are free of bias. However, it is important to note that the v-NLLS regression method is biased toward the data in the low concentration range. This is because the Langmuir equation has a sharp rise at low concentration values, which results in a large vertical error if the regression does not fit this region of the graph well. Conversely, the n-NLLS regression method does not have any significant bias toward any region of the adsorption isotherm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whereas linear regressions are relatively easy to pursue with simple programs, such as excel or hand-held calculators, the nonlinear regressions are much more difficult to solve. The NLLS regressions are best pursued with any of various computer programs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.9 Fluidized Bed</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A fluidized bed is formed when a quantity of a solid particulate substance (usually present in a holding vessel) is placed under appropriate conditions to cause the solid/fluid mixture to behave as a fluid. This is usually achieved by the introduction of pressurized fluid through the particulate medium. This results in the medium then having many properties and characteristics of normal fluids; such as the ability to free-flow under gravity, or to be pumped using fluid type technologies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The resulting phenomenon is called fluidization. Fluidized beds are used for several purposes, such as fluidized bed reactors (types of chemical reactors), fluid catalytic cracking, fluidized bed combustion, heat or mass transfer or interface modification, such as applying a coating onto solid items.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.9.1 Properties of fluidized beds</b></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">A fluidized bed consists of fluid-solid mixture that exhibits fluid-like properties. As such, the upper surface of the bed is relatively horizontal, which is analogous to hydrostatic behavior. The bed can be considered to be an inhomogeneous mixture of fluid and solid that can be represented by a single bulk density.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, an object with a higher density than the bed will sink, whereas an object with a lower density than the bed will float, thus the bed can be considered to exhibit the fluid behavior expected of Archimedes’ principle. As the “density”, (actually the solid volume fraction of the suspension), of the bed can be altered by changing the fluid fraction, objects with different densities comparative to the bed can, by altering either the fluid or solid fraction, be caused to sink or float.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In fluidized beds, the contact of the solid particles with the fluidization medium (a gas or a liquid) is greatly enhanced when compared to packed beds. This behavior in fluidized combustion beds enables good thermal transport inside the system and good heat transfer between the bed and its container. Similarly to the good heat transfer, which enables thermal uniformity analogous to that of a well mixed gas, the bed can have a significant heat-capacity whilst maintaining a homogeneous temperature field</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.9.2 Application</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fluidized beds are used as a technical process which has the ability to promote high levels of contact between gases and solids. In a fluidized bed a characteristic set of basic properties can be utilised, indispensable to modern process and chemical engineering, these properties include:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? Extremely high surface area contact between fluid and solid per unit bed volume</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? High relative velocities between the fluid and the dispersed solid phase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? High levels of intermixing of the particulate phase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">? Frequent particle-particle and particle-wall collisions</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.9.3 Fluidization</b></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Fluidization is defined as an operation through which fine solids are transformed into a fluid like state through contact with either a gas or a liquid.</h4><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.9.3.1 The Phenomenon of Fluidization </b></h4><p style="text-align: justify;">When a fluid is pumped upward through a bed of fine solid particles at a very low flow rate the fluid percolates through the void spaces (pores) without disturbing the bed. This is a fixed bed process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the upward flow rate is very large the bed mobilizes pneumatically and may be swept out of the process vessel. At an intermediate flow rate the bed expands and is in what we call an <i>expanded </i>state. In the fixed bed the particles are in direct contact with each other, supporting each other’s weight. In the expanded bed the particles have a mean free distance between particles and the particles are supported by the drag force of the fluid. The expanded bed has some of the properties of a fluid and is also called a <i>fluidized </i>bed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">First, we consider the behavior of a bed of particles when the upward superficial fluid velocity is gradually increased from zero past the point of fluidization, and back down to zero.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At first, when there is no flow, the pressure drop zero, and the bed has a certain height. As we proceed along the right arrow in the direction of increasing superficial velocity, tracing the path ABCD, at first, the pressure drop gradually increases while the bed height remains fixed. This is a region where the Ergun equation for a packed bed can be used to relate the pressure drop to the velocity. When the point B is reached, the bed starts expanding in height while the pressure drop levels off and no longer increases as the superficial velocity is increased. This is when the upward force exerted by the fluid on the particles is sufficient to balance the net weight of the bed and the particles begin to separate from each other and float in the fluid. As the velocity is increased further, the bed continues to expand in height, but the pressure drop stays constant. It is possible to reach large superficial velocities without having the particles carried out with the fluid at the exit. This is because the settling velocities of the particles are typically much larger than the largest superficial velocities used.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fig 1: Typical curves for a liquid-solid fluidized bed of particles of approximately uniform size.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, if we trace our path backward, gradually decreasing the superficial velocity, in the direction of the reverse arrows in the figure, we find that the behavior of the bed follows the curves DCE. At first, the pressure drop stays fixed while the bed settles back down, and then begins to decrease when the point C is reached. The bed height no longer decreases while the pressure drop follows the curve CEO. A bed of particles, left alone for a sufficient length of time, becomes consolidated, but it is loosened when it is fluidized. After fluidization, it settles back into a more loosely packed state; this is why the constant bed height on the return loop is larger than the bed height in the initial stat</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What struck you</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since I entered in the Court building through the metal detectors door, my eyes at first glance caught the attention of the people in the queue waiting to pay their fines. The payment office was fortified with thick glass and a sign was displayed at entrance stating ‘our staff have the right to perform their duties without harassment’. This was a good indication that tensions did or would arise on occasions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Type of Proceedings:</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There were several cases to be heard on the courtroom on that day where our group was attended. In particular, a young man was charged with two separate offences of driving under Section 5(1) Road Traffic Act 1988, (a) attempting to drive, and (b) being in charge of a vehicle, each with an alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit in relation to his breath.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Stage of Proceedings</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our group observed both the Prosecution and the Defence part</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Advocacy</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Crown Prosecutor in my opinion was fluent and articulate enough to get her point across. Despite the numerous folders she seemed adequately prepared for the case and seemed well versed in her profession. She did however lack the accustomed adversarial aggression or possibly possessed a different style but nonetheless executed her job professionally. The Defendant was not represented, but it seemed that he defended himself very well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> The only point I have noticed on the hectoring the witness was that the magistrate was not very positive. When he gave the judgment was not seemed very vocal, overall he would have little or nothing to say.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procedure:</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Defendant was sentenced through fine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> This was the second times he was convicted for similar offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> I have noticed that the magistrates court handle as many cases as possible every day to speed up the judiciary system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> It was interesting talking to the magistrate afterwards. He shared his intellectual view regarding the litigation process in the magistrates’ court in this country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Central Criminal Court:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I had never been to the Central Criminal Court before. I was really struck to see the environment and the lawyers of the court by comparing with the magistrates’ court. I found the court itself is very well organized and has got very strict security system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proceedings:</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This was a murder trial .by Jury</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Stage Proceedings</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I had observed the case when the prosecution handling the witness part.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Advocacy:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, I found the prosecution counsel was well prepared in that he knew the case facts well and demonstrated a very sure grasp of the facts of the case and hardly seemed to need to refer to notes. He was also very confident and clear when dealing with the legal principles involved.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Counsel’s questioning techniques overall were very impressive and effective although some of the questions were very long and seemed witnesses had trouble following them. He however did manage to get the whole facts out from the witness and didn’t face any bar to establish his case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> No.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> My personal view regarding the trial by jury in a criminal litigation is more expensive and less effective to achieve the justice. It takes longer time than usual.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Counsel often seemed to concentrate to get the Jurors attention by showing the photographs and some other evidential identification, which was quite impressive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Royal Court of Justice:</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">My initial impression was that the courts were very busy. The beautiful old courts lead off the Hall. The entrance takes me straight into the great Central hall. The Hall is impressive for its size and intricate mosaic floor. Once I enter their public galleries I might have the impression that some of these portraits have come to life. Judges long forgotten look down from huge portraits, which line the walks, or gaze from marble plinths in stony silence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Proceedings:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> This was an appeal case in the area of clinical negligence in tort belonging to the civil liability. The action had brought by the applicant’s mother due to the hospital’s negligence failing to take reasonable care, seeking compensation.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Stage of Proceedings:</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">I was lucky enough to see from the very beginning of the case, which was basically the Judge had given permission to start claimant’s version of the case. I was present the whole of the claimant’s case, including the cross-examination, after which the case was adjourned until Thursday.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Advocacy:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Especially, the defendant’s counsel’s advocacy was the art of persuasion, which involves natural talent and skills; he put much hard work and immense thought and cares in the manner of his presentation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> The case was adjourned until Thursday.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Litigants were not present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The action was funded by legal aid. The plaintiff was ready to produce the sufficient evidence against the case. When the Judge ruled in favour of the defendant, it was stated that the plaintiff possibility to loss the case. But the Judge explained the reasons and read a written statement on which all the facts of the case were explained in detail, and produced the decision that it will continue on next Thursday. So, I can’t predict about the gaining party of the case. However, it is a civil claim the losing side pays all legal cost including the defendants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“The African Charter, 1981 provides distinctively the rights, duties and the implementation procedure for the enforcement of rights”. Give justification for the statement.-illustrate &amp; explain</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights is an international human rights initiative that was enacted to promote and protect human rights and basic freedoms in the African continent. The Charter was initiated by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), known today as the African Union (AU). The charter came into existence when the Assembly heads of State and Government of the OAU decided in July 1979 to create a group of experts to draft an African Charter on Human and People’s Rights. The charter was adopted by OAU on 7 June, 1981 and the charter came into effect on 21 October 1986.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overview of the Charter</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The African Charter 1981 is a collection of 68 Articles. As a result of human rights violations undertaken by African leaders such as Idi Amin of Uganda, Dr. Banda of Malawi, Emperor Bokassa of Central African Republic, and Mengistu of Ethiopia, the African Charter is distinctive in its attempt to attach an “African fingerprint” on human rights discourse. The African Charter has received praise from human rights scholars for having economic, social, and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights in one binding instrument. Its preamble affirms the cardinal principle of interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights by expressly declaring, “Civil and political rights cannot be dissociated from economic, social and cultural rights in their conception as well as universality.” Among other rights, the African Charter gives express recognition to the right to property, the right to work, the right to enjoy the best attainable state of physical and mental health, the right to education, and the right to family protection, including special measures for the protection of the aged and disabled.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Another noteworthy feature of the charter is that it does not cater for the needs of people only, also individuals. If we consider certain articles, individual rights and freedoms such as civil, cultural, economic include rights to non-discrimination (article2). Article 6 ensures liberty and security of person; article 7 demands fair trial. According to article 9, people are expected to receive, express and disseminate information and opinions. Articles 14 and 17 cover areas of property and education respectively. Article 19 ensures that everyone is treated as equal. People may freely dispose of their wealth and natural resources (article 21); people have the right to a general satisfactory environment favorable to their development (article 24). The duties of the individual included in the charter require that: an individual’s rights and freedoms are only exercised with due regard to the rights of others (article 27). According to article 29, by virtue of their physical and intellectual abilities, an individual serves their national community (article 29). An individual works to the best of their abilities and competence and pays taxes imposed by law in the interests of the society; and an individual preserves and strengthens social and national solidarity (article 29). These are some of the charters and there are others which lay down other rights, duties and obligations of civilians as well as the sovereign authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Historical perspective of Human Rights in Africa</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For humanity to exist it is imperative that promotion and protection of human rights is established. Every nation has its own code of protecting their human rights. England’s laws regarding the protection of human rights are contained in the Magna Carta, while different declarations concerning rights and freedoms have been prepared by and for the societies to which their promoters belonged. Soon after the African states were formed, they immediately became members of the United Nations and promptly accepted the United Nation’s principles and norms. It is important to note that before the charter was mandated, human rights were recognized in the political constitutions of almost all independent African states. Some examples include Gabon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Liberia, Malawi, Tanzania, Cote D’Ivoire, Cameroon, Morocco and Togo. These states all contained lofty human rights provisions. At independence, the French-speaking African states invariably declared, in the preambles to their constitutions, adherence to the principles of democracy and human rights as defined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789 and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. Similar steps were taken by English-speaking African. Institutional provisions essential for the enjoyment of human rights, such as an independent judiciary, are also constitutionally established in African countries’ constitutions. The departure of colonial rule in the 1950’s and 1960’s and express codification of human rights norms in the domestic legal systems of the African states spelt a new beginning for a better Africa, however unprecedented, massive and systematic violations of basic human rights continued to be committed in the independent African states. Colonial rule may have ended, but the legacy remained Tribal wars and conflicts erupted that threatened the disintegration of African countries. There were gross violations in most of the states because human rights still were politically motivated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There were several factors responsible for this. They were</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">i. Most of the new states in the 1950 are quickly dismantled. Multiparty systems were replaced by one party system or military dictatorships. Military coups are, thus, regular feature in several of the states.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii. Military coups are accompanied by serious human rights violations. For example, in 1975, all opponents of Siaka Stevens in Sierra Leone were executed. Also in 1984, more than 35 people were executed after military trials in Cameron.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iii. For most of the states, freedom of press, free and regular elections, right to life are still luxuries. Mass executions, public and secret execution of opposing elements have been common feature in many states. Such practices can be seen in Guinea, Uganda, Liberia, Ghana Zaire, etc. In many African states newspapers are still owned by the Government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iv. Ethnic and religious differences have led to gross violation of human rights. Example: Burundi and Rwanda. In 1963 invasion of Rwanda from Burundi led to killing of 12000 Tutsis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">v. Poverty, lack of education, unawareness of fundamental human rights among the people of Africa is also a factor responsible for violations of the human rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the points above it is understandable how appalling was the condition of Human Rights in Africa. The charter was hence initiated to help curb such violations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Contents of the Charter</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The African Charter is classified into Three Parts; Part I focuses on Rights and Duties, Part II focuses on Measures of Safeguard, Part III is about General Provisions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Part I there are two chapters, Chapter I covers human and people’s rights and accounts for a total of 26 Articles.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> So if we observe these 26 Articles we can deduce that the Charter covers almost all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights including third generation rights such as sovereignty over resources, development, international peace and environment. The state parities are bound by the Articles to submit a report on the legislative or other measures that would ensure that rights, duties and freedoms are recognized<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> and such rights, duties and freedoms are promoted via teaching, education and publication that would allow people to understand these rights. Courts should be called in times of promotion of the stated rights and freedoms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter II focuses on Articles 27-29 and it focuses on the group and duties and how it connects the society in order to fulfill the basic needs as opposed to promotion of individual interests. Historically Africa specialized in allocation of social goods however according to the Charters, it is imperative that economic, social and cultural rights are ensured and only then will civil and political rights be enjoyed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Part II focuses on the Measure of Safeguard and there exists four chapters. Chapter I is called Establishment and Organization of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. This chapter covers Articles 30-44. Under the African Charter, two bodies were established for ensuring the promotion and protection of human and people’s rights. These are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i. The African commission on Human and Peoples rights</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii. The Assembly of heads of State and government of OAU</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The African commission on Human and Peoples rights is built within the standards of the Organization of African Unity. Article 30 mandates the establishment of the Commission to promote human and people’s rights and ensure their protection in Africa. The commission was established in 1987 and is located in Gambia.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The commission shall consist of eleven members and must exhibit high standards of morality, integrity, impartiality and competence in dealing with people’s rights and its favorable if members having legal background. the chosen members should serve in their personal capacity and not as representatives of States. These members have the right to diplomatic privileges as stated in the General Convention on the privileges and Immunities of the Organization of African unity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Assembly of heads of State and government of OAU is second in command for the promotion and protection of human and people’s rights and the most important freedoms as stipulated in The African Charter. It by itself can exclude the African Commission however it is devoid of judicial powers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter II is about the Mandate of the Commission and it is dictated by Article 45. The mandate contains four functions. Apart from those mentioned, The African Charter has also sanctioned an implementation machinery by the help of which a report is submitted about the legislative and other measure taken to ensure the freedom and rights as dictated by the charter. There are also ways by which State Parties or individuals can bring about the complaints. By Inter-state complaint mechanism only State Parties can bring upon complaints regarding violations of human rights in the form of writing. There are two methods of inter-state complaint. The bilateral procedure allows one State Party to file complaint against another State Party in violation of provisions of the Charter. The Direct Procedure is also the same but the complaint is made directly to the commission by addressing a communication to the chairman. The individual complaint mechanism allows individuals as well as national and international institutions to send communications to the commission. However there are some requirements<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""></a> for the communications to be considered.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strengths of the Charter<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""></a></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Since civil, political and socio-economic rights are jointly considered, African States may concur that there lies no difference among the three, and they are justifiable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Opposing discrimination of ethnic minorities will lead to more opportunities created</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Allowing machinery implementation by both commission and court allows the two to promote and protect human right without the two getting in each other’s way</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· By virtue of Article 3(1) of the protocol to the African Court on Human and People’s rights, the court can also rely upon other relevant Human Rights instrument sanctioned by the state.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Although article 55 puts some considerations before communication can occur, it is not certain that individual communications are allowed. The Commission at its 33<sup>rd</sup> session has established a procedure for dealing with individual communications and considered some based on their merits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Weaknesses of the Charter</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· There lies some vagueness in the definition of certain rights. For example the charter does not discuss the problems surrounding language, or define what does it mean by ‘human being’ or the charter doesn’t mandate formation of trade union or form strike to wage their demands.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Although the charter wishes to protect human rights, but there lies no coercive machinery to foster performance of the recommendations that are expected of the charter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The African Charter was not designed only to express the internationally recognized rights at the African level. To be precise, the Charter manifests the uniqueness of some of the human rights concerns of Africa from the rest of the world. Thus, it is an instrument that caters for African circumstances in particular .The peoples’ rights of the African Charter are aimed to address the unique situations of Africa. These rights are concocted in a way that is unprecedented in the international and other human rights system, and represents the continent’s reaction to its colonial past and its resolve to uphold its cultural values as expressing the identity of its peoples. Significantly, this novel approach is a legal and institutional representation of the urgent need to end the misery of peoples by redeeming their dignity. In this sense, it is meant to provide a comprehensive framework to respond to the current multifaceted crisis in the relationship of the state with its peoples. Existence of repression, domination and state sponsored attacks on some diverse cultures indicate people’s rights have not been fully realized. Yet the recognition of people’s rights is commendable and is sufficient warrant that people’s rights in Africa to have a bright future. Therefore the statement “The African Charter, 1981 provides distinctively the rights, duties and the implementation procedure for the enforcement of rights” is justified.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bibliography/References</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights</em>.

9048	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">“The agency relationship can be terminated by few reasons which causes the cancellation of the contract may not make the act invalid” Discuss</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong><em></em><strong>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span>:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Law of contract is that diversification of law which determines the circumstances in which promise made by the parties to a contract shall be legally binding on them. We all enter into a number of contracts everyday knowingly or unknowingly. Each contract creates some right and duties upon the contracting parties. The law of contract, 1872 is the Indian contract act, 1872 which puts down the law relating to contracts. Moreover, Indian contract handles with the enforcement of these rights and duties upon the parties. Indian Contract Act, 1872 came into effect from 1<sup>st</sup> September, 1872 which was extended to the whole of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir. However, according to this Act there is a relationship between a Principal and Agent and no consideration is necessary to create such relationship.<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> This essay will be discussed in three parts in the parlance of Law of Contract, 1872. Firstly, I would define what Principal, Agent and the relation between Principal and Agent are; secondly, what causes the termination of such relationship and finally, how this termination without the knowledge of the agent may not render the act invalid which has been done after the recession of contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEFINITIONS</span>:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">I would define the following terms according to the law of contract, 1782 as these terms are clearly explained in Chapter- X of the law of contract, 1872.</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>a.      </strong><strong>Principal:</strong></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">Any person who has the legal ability (meaning that they are not insane, or in certain circumstances a minor) to perform an act may be a principal and authorize an agent to carry out that act. Persons, corporations, partnerships, not-for-profit organizations, and government agencies may all be principals and appoint agents.</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>b.      </strong><strong>Agent: </strong></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"> Any individual capable of comprehending the act to be undertaken is qualified to serve as an agent.<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">      Purpose of an Agent:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> An agent is basically an employee and the key difference is that an agent and principal make an agreement that the agent will represent the principal in specific<strong> </strong>transactions or situations or can only act on behalf of a principal for certain issues (depending on the agreement). For example, a basketball player hires an agent and an agreement between the two may only give the agent power to negotiate contracts.</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>c.       </strong><strong>Relationship between Principal and Agent: </strong></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">A principal-agent relationship is an arrangement in which the principal legally appoints agent to act on its behalf, the agent acts on behalf of the principal and should not have a conflict of interest in carrying out the act. Therefore, the relationship between a Principal and an Agent is known as <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agency</span></em></strong> and the law of agency establishes guidelines for such a relationship. The formal terms of a specific principal-agent relationship are often described in a contract. Agent’s authority is said to be express when it is given by words spoken or written and consideration is not necessary to create such relationship.<a href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> This kind of relationship is governed by employment law and it is fiduciary, meaning it is based on trust. Normally, all employees who handle third parties are considered agents.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>How an Agency Relationship is formed:</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong>An agency relationship is formed when two parties (Principal and Agent) agree that one will represent the other in certain situations. However, an agency relationship is formed in four general ways:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Agency by agreement</strong>: This is the most common way where both sides agree on certain conditions and this agreement can be formed by either an express contract or by a simple conversation and handshake.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Agency by ratification</strong>: In this way, a party can agree to be an agent through a third party and an agency relationship is formed as long as the principal is then notified and approves the agreement.<a href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Agency by estoppels</strong>: Estoppels are also known as detrimental reliance and there are times when someone’s actions constitute to a third party that another person is your agent (when in fact the person is not). If the third party reasonably<strong> </strong>believes this is true, a court will prevent him/her from denying that the agency exists.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Agency by operation of law</strong>: Even if there was no agency agreement, courts will sometimes step in and consider a person to be an agent to prevent a party from suffering injustice.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>The purpose of the  “Agency” relationship:</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong>A contract to be made by an agent on behalf of a principal is considered to be the contract of the principal and not that of the agent which allows the principal to authorize somebody to carry out his/her duties, either for a particular purpose such as purchasing a house or generally to conduct many transactions. The agency relationship is usually entered into by informal agreement, but also can occur by formal agreement. In certain cases, the agency relationship must be specified in writing form and the acts must be legal.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>The basis of the Agency relationship:</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"> Inherent in the Principal-Agent relationship is the understanding that the agent will act for and on behalf of the principal. The agent assumes an obligation of loyalty to the principal that he/she will follow the principal’s instructions and will neither intentionally nor negligently act inappropriately in the performance of the act. An agent cannot take personal advantage of the business opportunities the agency position uncovers where principal, in turn, reposes trust and confidence in the agent. These obligations bring forth a fiduciary relationship of trust and confidence between Principal and Agent.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>The obligations of the Agent to the Principal:</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"> An agent must obey reasonable instructions given by the Principal and must not do Acts that have not been expressly or impliedly authorized by the Principal. The Agent must use reasonable care and skill in carrying out the duties. Most importantly, the Agent must be loyal to the Principal. The Agent must desist from putting himself/herself in a position that would ordinarily encourage a conflict between the agent’s own interests and those of the principal.<a href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> The Agent must keep the Principal informed as to all facts that materially affect the agency relationship.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>Duties of the Agent to the Principal:</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Agent must protect interests of principal. <a href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> In emergency, an Agent has authority to take any kind of necessary action in order to protect Principal from losses.<a href="#_ftn7" title="">[7]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Requires agent to perform certain duties<a href="#_ftn8" title="">[8]</a>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Duty of Good Faith (a fiduciary duty): </strong>An agent must perform his/her fiduciary duty to ensure a faithful relationship between an agent and a principal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Duty of Loyalty:</strong> An agent must act only<strong> </strong>for the benefit of the principal. Moreover, the agent should not act for personal gain and any information regarding the agency relationship should be kept confidential.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Duty to Obey All Lawful Instructions: </strong>An agent must act as the principal instructs and should not act without the principal’s permission wherein one exception is if a principal asks the agent to flout the law, the agent can refuse without breaching this duty and another exception is that an agent can deviate from a principal’s instructions during emergency situations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Duty to Act with Reasonable Care: </strong>The agent must perform for the principal in an acceptable manner which means that the agent should perform his/her duties with reasonable skill and responsibility.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Duty to give notice or notification: </strong>This is also known as the duty to inform where an agent must inform the principal of all matters concerning the subject matter of the agency relationship. For example, a painter hires an agent to sell some of his paintings. If the agent discovers that a buyer will be unable to pay, the agent must inform the principal of this fact.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>Duties of the Principal to the Agent:</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">A principal has duties towards his/her agent and failure to perform these duties can also result in a <strong><em>breach of contract</em></strong> or <strong><em>tort liability</em></strong>. A principal’s duties are very similar to that of an employer which may be specified in the contract between principal and agent.<a href="#_ftn9" title="">[9]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A principal’s duties include the following:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooperation:</strong> A principal must allow an agent to perform his duties and this being the case; a principal must cooperate with and assist an agent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Safe Working Conditions:</strong> An agent must be provided with safe working conditions by the principal. For example, the principal needs to warn an agent about unsafe situations while performing certain duties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compensation:</strong> Since a principal hires an agent, the agent expects payment to be made in a reasonable manner where the situation and the arrangement made between the parties will determine what is “reasonable.”While performing duties for the principal, an agent must be paid any out of pocket expenses by the principal.</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>d.      </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Invalid contract:</span></strong><strong> </strong>An invalid contract is a contract which ceases to be enforceable by law. A contract when originally entered into may be valid and binding on the parties which may subsequently become invalid.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3</strong>. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE TERMINATION OF AGENCY RELATIONSHIP</span></strong>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>a.      </strong><strong>Definition of  “Termination of Agency Relationship”: </strong></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong>The Principal can terminate an Agent’s authority at any time without having to give notice and if the trust between the Agent and Principal has broken down, it is not reasonable to allow the Principal to remain at risk in any transactions that the Agent might conclude during a period of notice.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">b.      How an Agency Relationship can be terminated:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"> The relation of principal and agent can only be terminated by the act or agreement of both parties to the agency or by operation of law<em>.</em> Once the relationship is terminated, the agent no longer has authority to act for the principal and the principal is required to inform third parties (that dealt with the agent) that the agency relationship has been terminated. There are many ways to terminate an agency relationship which include:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lapse of time:</strong> If the parties agree to set a time period for the agency relationship which terminates when the time period passes. For instance, you hire a person to be your agent for one year. After one year, the agency relationship automatically terminates unless you extend it. On the other hand, if the parties did not fix any appropriate time for the termination of contract, the contract is considered to be terminated after a reasonable time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Purpose achieved:</strong> Some agents are hired to achieve a certain purpose and once that purpose is achieved, the agency relationship is automatically terminated which you can extend. A basic example is when professional sports players hire an agent to only negotiate contracts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mutual agreement:</strong> An agency created for a specific purpose as well as an agency created by a power of attorney is terminated once the particular purpose for which it was created was achieved.<a href="#_ftn10" title="">[10]</a>  After the termination of the agency, the agent is free of any fiduciary duty to the principal arising from the agency relationship and both parties can terminate the agency by mutual agreement as such relationship requires the mutual approval of the parties and both the parties have power to withdraw their approval. Moreover, an agency may not be terminated by the act of one of the parties and should be done mutually and the mutual abandonment of an agency is a question of fact, since it is a matter of intention of both the parties. The court will ascertain such interest from the surrounding facts and circumstances of the transaction as well as implied from the conduct of the parties.<a href="#_ftn11" title="">[11]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Certain events:</strong> An agency relationship will automatically terminate upon the occurrence of certain events include death, insanity, or bankruptcy of either the principal or agent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, an agency can be terminated by <strong><em>operation of law</em></strong>. The death of the principal operates as an immediate and absolute revocation of the agent’s authority. The <strong><em>loss of capacity of a party</em></strong> resulting from temporary or permanent <strong><em>mental incompetency</em></strong> may result in the termination of the agency relationship. Similarly, <strong><em>bankruptcy of the principal</em></strong> is a valid reason for the termination of agency and the agent is divested of any authority to handle with any assets or rights of property of which the principal was divested by reason of the bankruptcy, irrespective of whether the agent receives notice of the insolvency. A power of attorney may be terminated by the bankruptcy of the principal. The mere bankruptcy of the principal will not automatically terminate agent’s authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A change in value of the subject matter or a change in business conditions may terminate or suspend the agent’s authority if the agent should reasonably deduce that the principal would not consent if aware of such facts.  Similarly, a change in legal identity of, or merger by, the principal is a valid ground for termination of an agency contract and the termination of the principal’s interest is yet another ground for terminating the agent’s authority. The agent’s authority ceases when the agent has notice of the fact.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How the termination without the knowledge of the agent may not render the act invalid which has been done after the recession of contract:</span></strong></p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>a.      </strong><strong>Recession of Contract:</strong></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">The recession of contract is the act of cancelling or ending law or the cancellation of all or some terms of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The destruction or annulling of a contract and the right to rescind a contract seems to suppose not that the contract has existed only in appearance; but that it has never had a real existence on account of the faults which accompanied it; or which prevented its actual execution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A recession of contract cannot be revoked by one party unless both parties can be placed in the same situation, and can stand upon the same terms as existed when the contract was made. The clear instance of this rule is where one party by taking possession has received a partial benefit from the contract.</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><strong>b.      </strong><strong>Termination without the knowledge of the agent may not render the act invalid:</strong></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Indian Contract Act, 1872, a termination of Principal-Agent relationship without the knowledge of the agent cannot make the act invalid after cancelling the contract. Whether the contract between a Principal and an Agent is written or spoken, when acts are completed by the principal without the authority of the agent, the principal can choose to make an agreement officially valid by signing it which is called <strong><em>Ratification</em></strong>. Knowledge requisite is also important for valid ratification as ratification can be invalid by someone whose knowledge of the facts of the case is not materially perfect.<a href="#_ftn12" title="">[12]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONCLUSION</span>:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The principal can control an agent’s conduct for any duties specified in the agreement as Principal is more powerful than Agent. Though an agent can represent a principal in anything, many principals restrict the scope of an agent’s representation. For example, if you are selling your house, you may hire an agent who only represents you in selling your house. However, there are two cases in which an agent, though acting without authority or exceeding its authority, may bind the principal and the third party to each other. The first case occurs whenever the principal ratifies the agent’s act. Therefore, the agency relationship can be terminated by few reasons which causes the cancellation of the contract may not make the act invalid.</p><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BIBLIOGRAPHY</span></strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><em>Merchant v.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The appointment of High Court Judges is an important aspect of judicial independence which requires that in administering justice judges should be free from all sorts of direct or indirect interference or influences. -Evaluate</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Separation of Judiciary (also known as the independence of the judiciary) is the idea that the judiciary needs to be kept away from the other branches of government. That is, courts should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government. The appointment of High Court Judges is an important aspect of judicial independence which requires that in administering justice judges should be free from all sorts of direct or indirect interference or influences. A functioning and an independent judiciary can restrain and hold the executive accountable together with other state institutions, as well as political and economic elites. Independence of judiciary depends on some certain conditions like mode of appointment of the judges, security of their tenure in the office and adequate remuneration and privileges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The mandatory issues of the separation of judiciary</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Independence </b>– the extent to which the judiciary is autonomous from the executive’s control</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Accountability </b>– the extent to which the judiciary can be held responsible for its decisions and actions</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Efficiency </b>– the internal capacity of the judiciary to carry out its objectives</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effectiveness </b>– the extent to which the judiciary has achieved its objectives/mandates</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Political Situation and Rationality of Judiciary</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Political situation in Bangladesh has now taken a very wild shape and the state machineries along with legal and media apparatuses are now being used to crush and obliterate opposition parties and their political symbols. The common practice in Bangladesh is not to take any legal action against the criminals of ruling party or alliance, while often harsh legal actions are taken against the opposition leaders and activists though sometimes there might have no evidence of corruption against them. The legal apparatus in Bangladesh therefore largely serves the interest of the ruling elites, and provides a powerful tool for them to abate and crush the political opponents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But It is very unfortunate that the judiciary of Bangladesh has been separated from the executive in 2007. However, the organ is not in satisfactory level to fulfill the hope of people. The main problem is in forming the separation itself. And the problem is of two aspects. One aspect is the attempt to separate the judicial service from the executive, in terms of supervisory control, power of appointment, etc. Another aspect is that the judiciary in recent times seems to have to take upon itself the role of policy-maker, a function which has traditionally belonged to the executive and legislature. Therefore, this research will be a guideline to the stakeholder to make an effective separation of judiciary to ensure rule of law in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Criticism of Judiciary Separation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Background</b>– specially appointed male and from renown family</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Appointment</b>– Dominated by the political party</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Training</b>– Get little training</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Political Biasness</b>– influenced by the present political party</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Unethical Mind</b>– Bribery and corruption</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Obstacles of Judiciary Separation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Political Control on the Judiciary</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last 21 months, the government has: (a) Compromised the independence of the judiciary by appointing incompetent and partisan Judges to the High Court division of the Supreme Court; (b) Re-organized the benches with their active political supporters in the most important writ and bail benches along with the appellate division by appointing less competent Judges by superseding other senior judges, which was not the custom of the highest judiciary of the country; and (c) Made regular undue intervention in judicial decisions through the politically appointed Attorney General’s office and that of Public Prosecutors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Corrupted Lawmakers </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Maximum judges and lawmakers in Bangladesh are corrupted, and they are easily be influenced and exploited by money and power. Taking bribes spontaneously and making the case diverted are not an exception but have become normalized in Bangladesh. While some traces of this practice dates back to the previous regimes, it has become a very common phenomenon and aggravated in recent days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Criminal Justice System</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The every Government interferes on the judiciary system. If this happened, it would be difficult for the party -in-power to lodge political cases against the opposition. The same is true when the Opposition goes to power. The Government, whichever party is in power, does not want to let go of its control over the criminal justice process because cases against the Opposition need to be manipulated. They are at the receiving end when in Opposition but don’t want to implement the separation of the judiciary when in power.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hatred among Political Parties</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our leadership instead of guiding the nation toward setting up a strong parliamentary democracy has so long been engaged in the politics of mutual hatred and vengeance. The intolerance and enmity between political parties have adversely affected the nation as a whole and virtually has divided the nation into some group antagonistic to each other. This inimical attitude of our political parties has not only polluted the politics of our nation. Of late the highest judiciary has reportedly been politicized.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Executive Dominated Judiciary </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Appointments of persons in the judicial service or as magistrates exercising judicial functions shall be made by the President in accordance with rules made by him in that behalf. The President cannot exercise his powers whatever, without the advice of the Prime Minister, accept of course his power to appoint the Prime Minister. This is how the executive organ is controlling the judiciary. Their appointments, postings, transfers, promotions, punishments etc. are at the hands of the President.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Interference of Appointing High Court Judges</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Politically motivated judge appointments have increased during the past few regimes. There are adverse effects in the appointment of partisan and less competent judges to the Supreme Court, on the quality of administration of justice, and on its independence. Among the 45 Supreme Court judges recruited by the previous Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led alliance government, more than one-third were allegedly affiliated with the ruling alliance, at least one-third of the 17 judges appointed by the current government have been involved in Bangladesh Awami League’s political activities. None of the successive regimes have done so. This is ostensibly to keep control over the judicial appointments.[1] Some South Asian countries like India and Pakistan already have given this mandate to their legislative bodies. It is a frequent debate in Bangladesh whether the politically appointed judges really favor their appointing authorities or political masters when it comes to justice. Hundreds of cases were deemed “politically motivated” in 2010, and charges or convictions were dropped–or soon will be dropped–letting many leaders of the ruling party off the hook. Of 10,489 cases reviewed by the committee, 6,788 were dropped. The court is being influenced by the ruling party. The court very speedily tries the cases where politicians have the chance to get bail. The political appointment of judges is definitely a big barrier to combating corruption in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Comparison with other countries</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In UK Judges can change the common law but there is no involvement of government. Judges must interpret and apply the law is in ensuring that the executive does not exceed its powers in law. The Lord Chancellor and other Ministers of the Crown must not seek to influence particular judicial decisions through any special access to the judiciary”. In USA judges of the Supreme Court and lower federal courts “hold their offices during good behavior.” This means the president cannot remove judges from office. Instead, only Congress can remove judges through impeachment and conviction for treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Recent Scenarios of Bangladesh</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">People are increasingly losing their trust in Bangladesh judiciary, as the current regime has already reshaped it and started using it as a tool for dominance and control. Gross violation of human rights, clemency to the convicted criminals belonging to the ruling alliance, and oppression of the political opponents through false and concocted cases are some of the clear manifestations. The current precarious state of the Bangladesh judiciary has been depicted in a recent issue of the journal of Asian Culture and History. The current regime formed a committee under the Ministry of Home Affairs to withdraw what it calls “politically motivated cases. So far following the committee’s recommendation 4,687 cases/charges have been withdrawn, and another 516 cases have been recommended to be withdrawn. The state of the judiciary has reached such a deplorable state that no court in Bangladesh currently dares to accept any case against the cadres of the ruling regime regardless of the magnitude of crimes, such as, murder, rape, arson, and abhorrent corruptions. Moreover, political opponents are routinely denied bails and detained on laughable cases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The newspaper report below shows two persons breaking the office of Supreme Court’s chief justice in 2006. These very two gentlemen are selected as the Supreme Court Justices. In another case, a person who is under murder case charge has also been picked as a Supreme Court Justice. When the newspaper disclosed his criminal record, the government forced the court to withdraw the charges against him, which shows the extent of moral degradation of the premier judiciary in Bangladesh where most judges are actually political activists of the ruling party. The Daily Star also reports that the government has taken steps to appoint hundreds of judges in the lower courts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Can Judiciary Offer any Hope?</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2007, Faisal Mahmud Fayzee, a Supreme Court judge appointed in 2001, was forced to resign following newspaper reports on forgery in the tabulation sheet of his academic results at Chittagong University. The court authorities withdrew him from judicial functions in the face of a boycott of his bench by lawyers. Although the higher judiciary is still respected and honored by the people, there are growing allegations of unfair practice in disposing of bail petitions, delay in disposing of cases, politically biased decisions and erosion of moral values in supervising the lower judiciary.[2]The judiciary should gradually make itself open to criticism and fair comments by the media and civil society members, for the sake of its own credibility and public trust. “As the institution of last resort for democracy, the judiciary should lead by setting example for others.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Recommendation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Without a clear separation the judiciary can’t function independently. Executive Magistrates should have their own duties to perform and the Judicial Magistrates their own. Appointment of judges is the most important way to control judiciary by executive. Therefore it is recommended that the appointment of judges, both in higher and subordinate judiciary should be by the judicial commission itself. Judicial commission will uniform rules and provisions as to appointment of judges which must be of transparent and effective to appoint qualified judges, because, sometimes unqualified persons are appointed as judges by undue influences or on political consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conclusion</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judiciary is the guardian of constitution as well as rights of citizen in a state to protect under legal framework. This organ is not only confined to be an organ like executive and legislature but also something more. Judiciary is the last hope and aspiration to restore the rights of citizen in a country. But this judiciary cannot act to restore these rights unless and until it is free from any undue influence and interference of any other organ. Therefore, it is an obvious need that the judiciary should be separated in truest sense to perform its functions independently which is the main object of the judiciary. But mere separation is not enough to perform its function effectively. And where there is no effective separation of judiciary, where there is no independent judiciary, there is no rule of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>References</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">I. http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/resource/articles-and-assignment/an-independent-judiciary-free-from-influence-of-legislative-and-executive-organs-of-the-state-is-the-prime-requirement-of-a-democratic-state/</p><p style="text-align: justify;">II. http://www.igs-bracu.ac.bd/UserFiles/File/archive_file/Judiciary_Policy_Note.pdf</p><p style="text-align: justify;">III.

A courier is a messenger, conveying something of importance from the sending source to the receiving source. Within this definitive context, couriers and courier services can come in many different types and styles. In past times, before there were vehicles, couriers were usually just individual messengers, who traveled from one place to another to deliver news, documents, or products. Examples of this were the courier services of medieval times, which were one or more people who delivered messages or goods on horseback, or the famous pony express riders, who relayed messages or goods across the United States by passing them along from rider to rider until they reached their destination. Courier services, as well as trains also used stagecoaches after they started coming into regular use. As time progressed and the age of technology set in, courier services began to use vehicles such as automobiles, modern trains, and airplanes. Suddenly the words “overnight” and “express” were starting to be used on a regular basis by courier services. Where once it would have taken days, weeks, or months for documents or products to be delivered, suddenly it was all becoming much more streamlined. Running a company that provided courier services was also becoming a lucrative prospect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.2 International courier services</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though almost all large courier services are international, there is one type of international courier service that stands out as different from the rest. This is the type of courier service that employs one or two actual people to deliver the shipment by traveling to the destination personally. These people are called “international couriers”, and they add a much more direct and personal touch to the delivery. Becoming an international courier can take some time, but the couriers themselves often find this type of work very rewarding. When you are employed as an international courier, you often get to travel to many different types of places for free, or for a greatly reduced cost. Though a large percentage of the time most international couriers do not deliver packages or documents overnight or express, there actually are times when they have to travel at a moment’s notice in order to deliver a shipment within a very short time. Many people, if the logistics of their lives allow for this type of travel, find it a very exciting way to travel, or even make a living.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.3 Standard courier services</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The standard courier services that most of us are familiar with are the ones that can involve shipping to places all over the world. These companies have processes and steps that they take to make sure those documents and packages get safely and securely from one place to another. Though from the consumer’s point of view the process of sending documents or packages is pretty straightforward – you give something to the courier service and it arrives where you send it – the actual process is much more involved. For instance, when you bring a package to a large courier service, the first thing that they will do is take down the pertinent information. The name of the person or company that you are sending the package to will be printed out and placed on the package, with a shipping number for tracking purposes. Your name and address will also be placed on the package. The courier service will document information on the package weight, and charges will be applied accordingly. Most packages are automatically insured up to a certain amount, but you can insure it for more if what you are sending is more valuable than that. If you do need more insurance, then an extra charge will probably be added to the shipping price. The price will also be adjusted according to how fast you would like the package to arrive at its destination. Overnight and express shipping will, of course, cost more. Once all of this is determined, the package is then sent by truck, and if necessary, by plane also.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.4 Personal courier services</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Personal courier services are usually defined as those services that send actual “messengers” from one place to another. As in the bike messenger example, the courier is usually only one person, and this person takes the message, package, or document from one place and delivers it personally to another place. These, of course, are smaller courier companies, and in some instances may involve only a few people who provide this service to established clients on a regular basis. When a company has a main headquarters in one part of a city, and an office on the other side of town, or a couple towns away, they can give a package or documents to a personal courier and this courier will use a vehicle to travel to the destination. As mentioned before, in large cities like New York City or Los Angeles, bike messengers are often used to take the shipment from one place to another, since logistics determine that with the traffic in large cities, it could be faster than driving. Many times, however, a personal courier will use a vehicle to transport the shipment when logistics determine that this would be the fastest way to deliver. The courier will be contacted, and will arrive to pick up the shipment, get the pertinent information, and will then drive to the destination and deliver the package or documents in person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.5 Business Courier Services:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are mainly the companies which dealing with foreign countries are using international courier.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.1 Offered Services of ARAMEX: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> International Express:</b></p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Worldwide Document Express</li><li>Worldwide Parcel Express</li><li>Cash on Delivery</li><li>Return Service</li><li>Cash Collect</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Domestic Express:</strong></p><p align="left" style="text-align: justify;">o Same-Day Domestic Service</p><p style="text-align: justify;">o Overnight Domestic Service</p><p style="text-align: justify;">o Domestic Document Return</p><p style="text-align: justify;">o Cash on Delivery</p><p style="text-align: justify;">o Domestic Distribution Services</p><p style="text-align: justify;">o Mailbag Services Mailbag Services</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Freight:</b></p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Door-to-Door</li><li>Door-to-Airport</li><li>Airport-to-Airport</li><li>Expedited Air</li><li>Wholesale Co-Loading</li><li>Charters</li><li>Exhibitions Handling</li><li>Special Projects</li></ul><p>Logistics:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Freight-Forwarding &amp; Custom Clearance</li><li>Warehousing</li><li>Facility Management</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Shop and Ship</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Catalog services</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Special Service</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Value added service:</b></p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Distribution</li><li>Professional Engineering Design</li><li>Consulting Services</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>There are various types of clients ARAMEX International have:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Basically the organizations or personnel who are using courier service are our clients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Who are using transportation facilities are our clients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whose need value added service is our client.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2 The specific competition of the ARAMEX both locally and internationally</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.2.1 TOP COMPETITORS IN BANGLADESH</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ DHL</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ FedEx</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ UPS</p><p style="text-align: justify;">§ TNT</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.2.2 TOP COMPETITORS IN GLOBALLY</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· INTEGERS WORLDWIDE LOGISTICS</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· SEKO Worldwide</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· DEC Express</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Unique and Custom Logistics</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Air Courier Dispatch</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Expedited Logistics Freight Service</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· DHL</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· FedEx</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· UPS</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· TNT</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· DPEX</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Advanced Express Services</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>· Advanced Express</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>· City Express, Inc.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <strong>Diamond Transportation Group, Inc</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <strong>EVERSON, CHB, Inc</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>· International Bonded Couriers, Inc.

9061	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The Arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 to assure proper conduct of proceedings, allows certain remedies against an award</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Arbitration and conciliation act, 1996 to assure proper conduct of proceedings, allows certain remedies against an award”. Discuss the grounds when arbitral awards can be set aside.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the compounding of risk factors often associated with cross-border relationships, appropriate structures for the management of conflict are critical. No written agreement, no matter how detailed or thoughtful, can anticipate or address all of the contingencies and risks arising over the span of a business relationship, especially one involving persons of different cultural and political backgrounds who may use different words, exhibit different behaviors, and harbor very different values and attitudes. . When it comes to submitting disputes to judgment by a third party, arbitration offers the most acceptable means of resolving disputes involving international transactions. Arbitration under the provisions of a recognized arbitral institution keeps the parties out of each other’s courts and allows the parties to select a neutral forum in a mutually accessible location with impartial decision-makers and procedures designed to provide a fundamentally fair hearing. It also provides a binding award which is widely enforceable under the terms of international conventions. In the words of the U.S. Supreme Court, international arbitration clauses are “an almost indispensable precondition to achievement of the orderliness and predictability essential to any business transaction.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Definition of the key terms:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arbitration: The process by which the parties to a dispute submit their differences to the judgment of an impartial person or group appointed by mutual consent or statutory provision.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Arbitration award:</strong> An arbitration award (or arbitral award) is a determination on the merits by an arbitration tribunal in an arbitration, and is analogous to a judgment in a court of law. It is referred to as an ‘award’ even where all of the claimant’s claims fail (and thus no money needs to be paid by either party), or the award is of a non-monetary nature.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Alternative Dispute Resolution: Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) processes are alternative methods of helping people resolve legal problems before going to court. ADR involves an independent third person, called a “neutral” who tries to help resolve or narrow the areas of conflict.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conventions and statutes</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Conventions.</i></b> The primary international convention governing international arbitration is the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (popularly known as the “New York Convention”)[1]. The New York Convention, which has been ratified by now ratified by more than 120 countries, including Russia, the United States, China, Japan, and most countries in Europe and Latin America, provides for broad international enforcement of arbitration agreements and ensuing awards with limited judicial intervention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the United States, the Convention has been implemented under the rubric of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The U.S. version of the New York Convention incorporates two permissive limitations in the Convention: (1) it applies only to the recognition and enforcement of awards made in another signatory state, and (2) it is limited to “commercial” relationships (including those between U.S. citizens involving property, performance or other connections with foreign states).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>National statutes; U.S. state statute</i></b><i>s: </i>Even if a nation has acceded to a Convention, domestic arbitration law may still play a part in governing the conduct of international arbitration. It is important that the terms of an international arbitration agreement be consistent with the arbitration law of the place of arbitration. Parties should make certain that their arbitration clause reflects what procedures, if any, are mandated by applicable arbitration law. The FAA. The U.S. version of the New York Convention specifically incorporates provisions of the domestic FAA. Moreover, a given arbitration agreement may be subject to both the domestic and international provisions of the FAA. For U.S. parties and their business partners, therefore, American arbitration law may be of great significance. Under the FAA, as discussed in earlier chapters, arbitrating parties enjoy considerable flexibility in tailoring arbitration agreements; judicial oversight of the process and of arbitral awards is extremely limited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">State statutes. A number of U.S. states have adopted statutes covering international arbitration, some of which are at least partly modeled on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration[2], discussed below. However, within its purview the FAA applies in both federal and state court[3]s, and preempts conflicting state law unless the parties have specifically agreed to the contrary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>UNCITRAL.</i></b> The United Nations Committee on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) developed a model law on arbitration and rules for arbitration. The UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1985, generally parallels the New York Convention and is consistent with that convention. The UNCITRAL Model Law is more detailed, however, and fills some of the gaps left by the Convention’s limited provisions. A number of countries, primarily those whose arbitration law was not up-to-date, have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law. In addition, some U.S. states have enacted statutes based at least partly on the UNCITRAL Model Law. In jurisdictions subject to the U.N. Convention but not the UNCITRAL Model Law, the Convention may be supplemented by an agreement incorporating the UNCITRAL International Commercial Arbitration Rules.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Procedures most familiar to U.S. practitioners</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">International arbitration institutions. There are today literally dozens of institutions ready and willing to assist parties to international arbitration agreements. Indeed, there are arbitral institutions in almost every leading trading country in the world. Many parties will initially suggest using their home country institution, if only for the sake of convenience. To avoid the dilemma of protracted negotiation over a particular administering institution, however, many agreements look to an institution that has the aura of neutrality and is not based in the home country of either party. Moreover, some institutions offer significantly more experience and organizational expertise than others.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Arbitral Awards and Their Enforcement:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The authority of arbitrators to fashion relief and the enforceability of awards incorporating particular remedies are a function of the scope of the agreement of the parties and applicable substantive law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Specific, non-monetary relief.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Awards of specific performance and other non-monetary relief should be enforceable to the extent they are within the scope of the parties’ agreement and not prohibited by applicable law. Parties foreseeing a potential need for such relief are well advised to address the issue by an explicit provision in their agreement. The CPR International Rules explicitly authorize arbitrators to award such relief; a number of other institutional rules do not.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Punitive or exemplary damages.</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the FAA and the weight of state arbitration law in the U.S., arbitrators have authority to award punitive or exemplary damages. Parties from other legal systems, especially those which regard such measures as contrary to public policy, tend to view such possibilities with alarm. For such reasons, parties to international commercial agreements may consider expressly denying arbitrators the authority to make such awards, or even “waive” such relief entirely. For example, the AAA International Arbitration Rules provide that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Unless the parties agree otherwise, the parties expressly waive and forego any right to punitive, exemplary or similar damages unless a statute requires that compensatory damages be increased in a specified manner.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under U.S. law, the enforceability of an outright pre-dispute waiver of punitive damages remains an open question. In such case, if for any reason the waiver is deemed ineffective, the party seeking punitive damages may be required to submit the issues to arbitration and not a court under a broad form clause.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most international arbitral rules provide that the costs of the of the arbitration shall be allocated by the arbitral tribunal in the final award that is rendered. The general rule — embodied in the LCIA Rules, is that costs follow the event. This usually means that the losing party pays the costs. If parties are desirous of providing otherwise, it should be in the arbitration clause. A usual provision is that the costs of arbitration shall be borne equally unless the tribunal in its discretion determines otherwise. The CPR International Rules contain a detailed description of what is entailed by “costs,” and recognizes the authority of the tribunal to require a deposit as an advance for anticipated costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pre-award interest.</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Pre-award interest on awarded damages may represent a significant sum; therefore, the awardability of interest should normally be addressed in the agreement. Some arbitration procedures, such as the AAA International Rules, contain pertinent provisions. If the parties do not address the point, the governing law may or may not be of help. Where the agreement is silent, arbitrators tend to find that pre-award interest is a matter within their discretion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Currency of the Award</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the nature of international agreements, the currency of the award may be crucial. Currency fluctuations themselves are the cause of many disputes. U.S. practitioners understand that even though an agreement may be with a U.S. party and in the English language, there is no assurance that the award will be rendered in U.S. dollars. If the contract is silent, the arbitrators will decide the currency in which the award will be paid. Parties often specify the currency of the award–especially in cases where your client is likely to be the claimant. It is best to specify a convertible currency, such as U.S. dollars. Some institutional rules address these issues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Standards for decision making</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under leading international arbitration rules, arbitrators typically are required to apply the law, and not their own concepts of equity or fairness (ex aequo et bono). There are, however, instances in which the parties explicitly have given the arbitrators the power to disregard strict rules of law, e.g., to act as an amiable compositeur. Such provisions are sometimes used in long-term commercial contracts, including reinsurance agreements. In practical experience, even where no such power has been conferred on them,. arbitration panels often consider they have the power to “do justice,” and their decisions may appear based in whole or in part on considerations of fairness. Where the parties to the arbitration agreement prefer the panel to apply the law strictly, they should say so in the agreement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Statements of rationale</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Awards accompanied by a statement of reasons should be and generally are provided in international arbitral proceedings, although some attorneys believe that such statements may make awards more vulnerable to attack in subsequent proceedings. Under the rules of most international arbitral institutions, some form of accompanying statement of rationale is required unless the parties agree to the contrary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Finality of international awards</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The policy and practice of treating international awards as final and reviewable only on narrow grounds have been enforced by courts in the United States and Europe — although precise standards vary. Most of the international arbitral institutions promoting international arbitration as the preferred method of resolving disputes emphasize the finality of proceedings conducted under their rules, and the extremely limited scope of judicial review applicable to such awards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enforceability of foreign awards under the New York Convention</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The enforceability of foreign arbitral awards is essentially a matter of international treaty. The 1958 New York Convention is the most significant of these treaties. It applies to awards made within the territory of a state other than the state in which recognition and enforcement is sought, and to “arbitral awards not considered as domestic awards in the state where the recognition and enforcement are sought.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Convention, prior judicial recognition of an award in the country where the award was rendered is not typically required for enforcement: for the purpose of international conventions. Once the proponent of the award has produced the award and arbitral agreement under which it was granted, the burden of proving the non-enforceability of an award is on the the party “against whom it is invoked.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article V of the Convention sets forth a limited list of grounds upon which a country may refuse recognition or enforcement to an award. These include:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) invalidity of the arbitration agreement under applicable law (as specified in the agreement or, in the absence of specific provision, under the law of the country where the award was made);</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) lack of a fair opportunity to be heard;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(3) an award outside the scope of the submission;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(4) an arbitral authority or procedures not in accordance with the parties’ agreement, or, in the absence of such agreement, the law of the country where the award was made ;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(5) lack of a final, binding award, as where an award “has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc367711550"></a>Enforcement and challenge in the courts of the country where the award is rendered.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A number of questions regarding application of the New York Convention to the enforcement and vacatur of awards in the country where rendered have been addressed by judicial decisions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Enforcement of non-domestic awards rendered in the U.S. Courts have made clear that the Convention may apply to awards rendered in the U.S. in an arbitration in which some or all of the parties are foreign.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Law applicable to set-aside actions. Article V(1)(e) of the Convention impliedly contemplates an action seeking to have the award vacated or set aside by the courts of the country of rendition. It does not, however, specify whether that country’s domestic arbitration law is applicable to such actions. The question is very important since the domestic law of some countries provides grounds for vacatur beyond those set forth in Article V of the Convention, discussed above.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In one recent decision, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that while a U.S. court could not refuse to enforce an award rendered in a foreign country on grounds other than those enumerated in Article V, the Convention authorized set-aside actions in the country of rendition, under the domestic law of that country. Under this approach, “non-domestic awards” (such as an award in an arbitration between two foreign parties or an arbitration between a domestic party and a foreign party) are subject to the grounds for the review of domestic awards under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) in addition to the grounds described in the Convention. Because it exposes international arbitration awards to the vagaries of local law, arguably undermining the intended goal of the Convention to provide uniform enforcement of such awards, this result has been criticized by a number of commentators. .</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is authority for the proposition that in the U.S. a party may raise defenses to enforcement under Article V of the New York Convention without moving to set aside the award.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impact of a set-aside on foreign enforcement.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article VII of the New York Convention states that “the provisions of the Convention shall not act to deprive any interested party of any right he may have to avail himself of an arbitral award in the manner and to the extent allowed by law . . . of the country where such award is sought to be relied upon.” Relying upon this language, and upon the fact that the Convention apparently gives courts discretion to refuse to enforce an award vacated in the country where rendered under Article V(1)(e), a U.S. federal district court in the Chromalloy decision denied res judicata effect to an Egyptian court decision nullifying an arbitration award on grounds of U.S. policy, and enforced the award under the FAA. More recently, the Second Circuit refused to follow Chromalloy in a similar case, citing principles of comity and the impropriety of enforcing an award nullified in a proper set-aside action in a foreign court. Chromalloy has engendered fierce debate between those who say it appropriately limits the ability of courts in the country of rendition to thwart enforcement abroad through set-aside actions and those who believe it permits inconsistent treatment of set-aside awards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Strategic challenges.</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Occasionally, awards are challenged in the country where renderedfor strategic reasons. In certain circumstances, an award that is under attack in the courts of the country where it was rendered will not be enforced anywhere until the judicial challenge has been finally resolved, although there are notable exceptions to this principle. In the jurisdiction where the challenge has been filed, a final resolution could take years. The prospect of delay may motivate a settlement of the dispute on terms different from those prescribed in the award.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strategic challenges to arbitration awards are generally disfavored by established members of the international arbitration bar. Unless extraordinary error has obviously infected the arbitral proceedings, the presumption of and preference for finality in such awards is strong among lawyers who specialize in international arbitration. If a party believes that the arbitral panel has committed serious error, but finds that its counsel in the proceedings is unduly reluctant to consider any effort to challenge the award in judicial proceedings in the country where rendered, a second opinion from independent, qualified counsel may be desirable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Waiver of the right to judicial recourse.</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where applicable law permits resort to courts on points of law, concerns regarding the potential delays and costs associated with judicial intervention may motivate parties to seek to avoid such recourse. In England, for example, the courts traditionally had the power to decide all questions of law in arbitration, and parties often raised issues of law during arbitration and delayed the proceedings by asking a court to decide the issues. A party unhappy with an award could also challenge the award on the basis the arbitrators had made a mistake of law. Over the years, various arbitration acts have given parties power to agree to limit the courts’ monopoly on deciding questions of law. The Arbitration Act of 1996 permits parties to waive their rights to bring questions of law to the courts during an arbitration and to challenge an award for a mistake of law. Especially if the place of arbitration is England or a British Commonwealth country, parties may wish to include a provision in their arbitration clause waiving any right the parties may have to seek judicial rulings on issues of law during the arbitration and waiving any right to appeal the arbitral award based on errors of law. Some sets of arbitration rules, including the LCIA Rules and the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules, contain such waivers. English courts have also held that a clause incorporating the ICC Arbitration Rules operate as a waiver of the right to seek judicial rulings on errors of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The courts do not have jurisdiction to set aside a foreign arbitral award under the UNCITRAL Model Law.. That ruling has attracted critical commentaries. Instead of simply echoing them, this article has ventured to suggest that any concern that the setting aside of a foreign award may undermine the finality of arbitration is largely unfounded and that its only negative effect would be a possible confusion that might be brought about by the unfamiliarity of such a measure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This report has further endeavoured to show what useful purpose, if any, could be served by accepting jurisdiction over a challenge to a foreign arbitral award. It has come to an affirmative conclusion, albeit in a limited situation. Thus, accepting such jurisdiction may, if the challenge is made in a country closely connected with the underlying contract, serve the useful purpose of providing the court with an opportunity to make findings under its own legal system as to whether the underlying contract is illegal, how significant is such illegality, and whether the illegality has the effect of rendering the contract unenforceable, so that the court in another country seized of proceedings to set aside, recognize or enforce the same award would be able to take notice of such findings and thereby form an accurate view concerning such illegality if that court, in scrutinizing the compatibility of an arbitral award with its own public policy, needed to take into account the illegality of the underlying contract under the law of countries which were more closely connected with the contract. This process may serve the further useful purpose of promoting, albeit indirectly, the legal policy of countries closely connected with the underlying contract that may otherwise be by-passed.</p><hr/><p style="text-align: justify;">[1]Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 21 UST 2517 [hereinafter New York Convention</p><p style="text-align: justify;">[2]UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAWS, UNCITRAL MODEL LAW ON INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION, 40 U.N.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">THE ARTICLES DEFINE THE DUTIES, THE RIGHTS AND THE POWER OF GOVERNING BODY AS BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE COMPANY AT LARGE AND THE MODE AND FORM IN WHICH THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY IS TO BE CARRIED ON.</p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">1.     INTRODUCTION</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Company is made by law where each organization has own identity. It is a common term which is an association of a number of directors and shareholders, formed for some common purpose and registered according to the law relating to companies. Lord Justice Lindley<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> defines, “By a company is meant an association of many persons who contribute money or money’s worth to a common stock and employ it for a common purpose. The common stock so contributed is denoted in money and is the capital of the company. The persons who contribute it or to whom it belongs are members. The proportion of capital to which each member is entitled is his share<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>”. Law or the Company Act gives clear guideline about how the organization can be managed and executed.  However, company can’t run by itself. There are group of directors, chairman, managing director – top level executors to run the company. This research is going to talk about what duties, power and rights they have as board of directors to run the company.</p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">2.     FORMATION OF A COMPANY</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Company Act 1994<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>, “Any seven or more persons or, where the company to be formed will be a private company, any two or more persons associated for any lawful purpose may subscribing their names to a memorandum of association and otherwise with the requirements of this Act in respect or registration form an incorporated company, with or without limited liability. – Section 5”. So the documents and registration is must required no matter whether it is a private company or a public one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are many steps we need to follow to form a company successfully which are given below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 1: Steps of Formation of a Company</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The very first stage is the promotional stage where the promoter thinks to form a company for specific purpose. They have to take necessary decisions regarding company name, address, types of the company, what they are going to do, authorized and paid-up capital, how they collect the paid-up capital, etc. They have to collect name clearance from the authorized registrar. Now it is the time to prepare the documents like – memorandum of association<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> and articles of association<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>. Then the promoters have to submit all the documents to the registrar’s office to authorize the company under the company act. Finally, registrar office gives the certificate of incorporation and the certificate of commencement. Company Act 1994 Sec 23(1)<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> states, “On the registration of the memorandum of a company the Registrar shall certify under his hand that the company is incorporated”. After successful completion of all these documents and registration, a company can starts its operation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">3.     MEMORENDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The most important documents to form and run a company are the memorandum of association and the articles of association. Without these two documents no company can be formed and registered.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">A.     Memorandum of Association</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is the main document that governs the relationship between the company and the outside. It is one of the documents required to incorporate a company in many common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth. Bangladeshi Company Act 1994 sec – 2(1-n)<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> states, “Memorandum means the memorandum of association of a company as originally framed or as altered in pursuance of the provisions of this Act”. It is not cleared from the act but Lord Cairns defined it more carefully in a case<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>. He said, “The Memorandum of Association of a company is its charter and defines its limitation of the powers of the company, established under the Act”. Memorandum of Association contains different clauses which are –</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="284">Ø      Name   clause</td><td valign="top" width="284">Ø      Situation   and address clause</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="284">Ø      Object   clause</td><td valign="top" width="284">Ø      Capital   clause</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="284">Ø      Liability   clause</td><td valign="top" width="284">Ø      Consent   clause</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, the memorandum contains all these fundamental conditions upon which alone the company is to be incorporated.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">B.     Articles of Association</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is the second most important document that is required to run the company perfectly. It includes internal rules and regulations of a company which directly describes the duties, rights, power and responsibilities of the directors; nature and the process of the business; and the changing of internal management rules and nature. Lord Cairns also agreed with this definition of Articles of Association.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is a significant relation between Memorandum and the Articles of Association. Lord Cairns in Riche, described the relationship between the memorandum and the articles in this language: “The memorandum is as it were, the area beyond which the actions of the company cannot go; inside the area, the shareholders may make such regulations for their own government as they think fit<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>“.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      The Articles are subordinate to Memorandum.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      The Memorandum must be read in conjunction with the Articles.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      The terms of the Memorandum cannot be modified or controlled by the Articles.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="568"><strong><em>Laws alone can not secure   freedom of expression; in order that every man present his views without   penalty there must be spirit of tolerance in the entire population. </em></strong><p>–            <strong><em>Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955)</em></strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 style="text-align: justify;">4.     LEGAL EFFECT OF THE ARTICLES</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We know Articles of Association contains internal rules and regulations. It has same importance as memorandum of association. The legal effects are –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      It is one kind of contract between the company and the shareholders. After the registration it is assumed by the act that company and the shareholders both agreed with all the conditions of Articles of Association. Both parties must are oblige to maintain the conditions. If necessary it can be enforced by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      If any party breaks any condition then any party can take legal action against other party for breaking the rules of Article of Association.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      If any shareholder has the liability to the company according to the Article of Association then s/he must pay that liability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      It is a document that is open for all who are linked with the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">5.     FORMS AND CONTENTS OF ARTICLES</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to under section 18 of Company Act 1994, any company whose liability is limited can have the sample schedule 1 as their Article of Association. However, for the company whose liability is not limited they have to have a separate Article of Association. Under sec 19 of Company Act 1994<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>, it has been stated regarding how an Article should be formed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>[“Articles shall – </em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      <em>Be printed;</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      <em>Be divided into paragraph numbered consecutively; and</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      <em>Be signed by each subscriber of the memorandum, who shall add his address and description in the presence of at least two witness who shall attest the signature.”]</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are many issues that need to be discussed in the Articles of Association. Those issues should be very specific and very straight forward. The contents of Articles of Association are discussed below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Share Related Issues</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Share capital, rights of shareholders, payment of commissions, share certificates;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      No of share; Share price; Selling of a share;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Lien on shares; Calls on shares; Transfer of shares;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Transmission of shares; Forfeiture of shares;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Conversion of shares into stock; Share warrants;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Capital Related Issues</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Alteration, of capital; Authorized capital;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Types of the capital; Rules for reforming capital;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meeting Related Issues</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Call up an AGM, EGM or any other meeting;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      General meetings and voting rights of members;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Appointment and remuneration of directors, board of directors, managers and secretary;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dividend/Profit Related Issues</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Dividends and reserves;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Accounts and audit and borrowing powers;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Capitalization of profits;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Winding-up Related Issues</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Winding up;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Distribution of the liabilities-assets after winding up</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 2: Two Main Phase to form The Company</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">6.     GOVERNING BODY/BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Managing a company is quite different from any other types of business. Though shareholders are the real owner of a company, but they can’t be that much active in operation. Their contribution is very limited. However, board of directors (also referred as the governing body) work as agent of the shareholder they has the highest power to run the company. Now the question is – who are the directors? According to the Company Act 1994<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>, “Director includes any person occupying the position of director by whatever name called”. [sec. 2(f)]. The board of the directors plays the most vital role in a company. All the executions are taken care by the board of directors. For public limited company there should be minimum 3 directors and 2 directors for the public limited company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="568"><strong><em> </em></strong>” <strong><em>Even when laws have been   written down, they ought not always to remain unaltered.”</em></strong><p>–           <strong><em>Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC),   Politics </em></strong><br/><strong> </strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 style="text-align: justify;">7.     LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE DIRECTORS</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Legal position of the directors can be categorized into three parts.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">A.     Director as Agent</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every company has its own entity by the law. But a company can’t do anything by itself. That’s why it needs agents who help to do necessary works. Directors play a vital role for the company for which we can identify them as the agent of the company. Cairns L. J.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> agreed with the idea and said:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“What is the position of the directors of a public company? They are merely agent of the company. The company itself cannot act in its own person, for it has no person, it can only act through directors, and the case is, as regards those directors, merely the ordinary case of principal and agent, for wherever an agent is liable those directors would be liable, where the liability would attach to the principal, and the principal only, the liability is the liability of the company”.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">B.     Director as Trustee</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Directors are the trustee of a company as they maintain everything and monitoring all the activities for the company. In this case, Ramaswamy Iyer Vs. Brahmayya &amp; Co<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> directors are identified as trustee. Though directors are the trustee but there are some limitations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">C.     Director as Employee</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">By law, directors can’t be defined as the employee of the company. Though, any directors can be employee by signing a contract between him/r and the company. There are no restrictions in this case by law. So any directors can also be the Managing Director of the company. Lord Selborne<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> said, “The directors are the mere trustees or agents of the company, trustee of the company’s money and property, agents in the transactions which they enter into on behalf of the company”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="568"><strong><em>“Law stands mute in the   midst of arms.” </em></strong><p>–            <strong><em>Cicero</em></strong><strong><em> (106 BC  – 43   BC), Pro Milone</em></strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">8.     POWER OF DIRECTORS</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The powers of the directors are clearly defined by the Article of Association.

The body sometimes has a different name, such as board of trustees, board of governors, board of managers, or executive board. It is often simply referred to as “the board.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Wikipedia<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>, A board’s activities are determined by the powers, duties, and responsibilities delegated to it or conferred on it by an authority outside itself. These matters are typically detailed in the organization’s bylaws. The bylaws commonly also specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and when they are to meet. The board is elected by the stockholders and is the highest authority in the management of the corporation. In a non-stock corporation with no general voting membership, e.g., a university, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Typical duties of boards of directors include –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Governing the organization by establishing broad policies and objectives;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the chief executive;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Approving annual budgets;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ü      Accounting to the stakeholders for the organization’s performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and with the jurisdiction within which it operates. For public corporations, these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Articles are a requirement for the establishment of a company under the law of India, the United   Kingdom and many other countries. Together with the memorandum of association, they constitute the constitution of a company. The Articles of Association is the main thing that shows the path to the director about how they run the company. The issuing of shares (also called stock)<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a>, valuation of intellectual rights, the appointments of directors<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a>, directors meetings<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a>, management decisions<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a>, transferability of shares<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a>, special voting rights of a Chairman, and his/her mode of election, the dividend policy<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a>, winding up – the conditions, notice to members, confidentiality of know-how and the founders’ agreement and penalties for disclosure, first right of refusal<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> – actually everything is directly discussed in the Articles of Association.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="561"><strong><em>“It was the boast of   Augustus that he found </em></strong><strong><em>Rome</em></strong><strong><em> of brick and left it of marble.

And which, along with memorandum of association, forms the constitution of a firm. Also called articles, it is a contract (1) between the members (stockholders, subscribers) and the firm and (2) among the members themselves. It sets out the rights and duties of directors and stockholders individually and in meetings. As Articles of Association has certain rules and regulation, the directors can’t do anything that is prohibited by the Articles. So, the duties, rights and the power of the directors are clearly bound by the Articles, by the Company Act. What the directors will do must be matched with the Articles. If any decisions or anything has been done that is not authorized by the Articles will not be valid by the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, we can agree with the topic that the articles define the duties, the rights and the power of governing body as between themselves and the company at large and the mode and form in which the business of the company is to be carried on.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h1 style="text-align: justify;">13.           BIBLIOGRAPHY</h1><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ø      Articles of Agreement Law &amp; Legal Definition</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ø      Company.” Crystal Reference Encyclopedia.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://issuu.com/md.papon/docs/the_aspects_of_labour_strikes_in_ba">View With Charts And Images</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Aspects of Labor Strikes in Bangladesh</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the light of “The Industrial Relations Ordinance (IRO), 1969”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our social life is subject to numerous laws. Law is an important part of social structure that regulates our social life. There are numerous laws – some regulates our social behavior and some are to regulate the behavior of organization. Again there are some provisions of law to ensure the right of the worker. As the worker is always deprived of their right, this provision has given the opportunity of this deprived section to enjoy their right. Due to the opportunity to form an organization of their own, the labor has got the opportunity to speak of their problem. Now they are in a position to bargain with the management and other regulative authority. They can jointly fight to save their right. Strike is one form of demonstrations all the workers can do rather than trade union, collective bargaining, negotiation, lock out etc. Strike is one of the important sections of “The Industrial Relations Ordinance (IRO), 1969.” The nature of strikes varies due to the nature of the industry they exist. The role and objective also differ substantially due to changing working condition and very nature of the business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Historical Background of Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The strike tactic has a very long history. Towards the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> dynasty, under Pharaoh Ramses<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> III in ancient Egypt in the 12<sup>th</sup> century BCE, the workers of the royal necropolis organized the first known strike or <i>worker’s uprising</i> in the history. The event was reported in detail on a <i>Papyrus</i> at that time, which has been preserved and currently located in Turin.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strikes first became important during the industrial revolution<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, when mass labour became important in factories and mines. In most countries they were quickly made illegal as factory owners had far more political power than the workers. Most western countries legalized striking partially in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Communist regimes such as the former USSR, striking was illegal and viewed as counter-revolutionary. It is also illegal for an employee of the United States Federal Government to strike. President Ronald Reagan terminated air traffic controllers after their refusal to return to work from an illegal strike in 1981<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the government in such systems was meant to represent the working class it was claimed that unions and strikes were not necessary. Most other totalitarian systems also ban strikes. In some democratic countries like Mexico, strikes are legal but subject to close regulation by the state.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notable General Strikes</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>1820 Rising in Scotland<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></li><li>Russian Revolution of 1905<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></li><li>1912 Brisbane General Strike<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></li><li>Winnipeg General Strike of 1919<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></li><li>Seattle General Strike of 1919<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></li><li>British General Strike of 1926<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></li><li>San Francisco general strike of 1934<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a></li><li>Toledo General Strike of 1934<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></li><li>Great Arab Revolt of 1936 <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></li><li>French general strike of May 1968<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a></li><li>Uruguay general strike of 1973<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a></li><li>Northern Ireland general strike of May 1974<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a></li><li>Spanish general strike of 1988<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></li><li>Italian general strike of 2002<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a></li><li>Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">· Ukraine’s Orange Revolution of 2004<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Notable Strikes in Bangladesh from 1950 – 2004</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh is also famous for having general strikes. Some have small impact on economy an some have large impact. Sometime a strike is called for higher payment of minimum wages and for privatization of state owned mills and factories. On July 30, 1997<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a>– such strike was called where more than 3000 protesters were gathered to raise their voices against all the disputes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The following table shows the numbers of strike are held and days lost because of those strikes from 1950 to 2004 in Bangladesh.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The year 1957 and 1964 have the highest number of strikes before the independence of Bangladesh. At that time on an average of 2174615 days were lost because of those strikes occurred. But surprisingly, instead of getting low rate of occurring strikes in the country, in year 1981 and in 1984, there were more strikes happening in the country along with continuation from previous years. But after all those years the rate of occurring general strikes in our country have become less and less which shows an improvement in year 1997 with zero rate of strike occurring in the country</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Table 1: Number of Strike and days lost from 1950 – 2004 in Bangladesh</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td

style="text-align: justify;">Strike is carried out by a group of employees, for the purpose either of enforcing demands relating to employment conditions on their employer or of protesting unfair labor practices. In Europe and Asia, strikes have sometimes been called for political purposes. Strikes are conducted most frequently by workers organized into trade unions. A sympathy strike occurs when a union stops work to support the strike of another union<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General definition</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Strike </b>is the mass refusal by employees to perform work due to certain grievances. If an agreement could not be reached, workers could strike, or refuse to work until certain demands were met<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A strike may consist of workers refusing to attend work or picketing outside the workplace so as to prevent or dissuade other people from working in their place or conducting business with their employer. Or, a strike may consist of workers attending or occupying the workplace, but refusing to do their jobs or leave. Strikes may be specific to a particular workplace, employer, or unit within a workplace, or they may encompass an entire industry, or every worker within a city or country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Definition as per IRO, 1969</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">‘Strike’ means a cessation of work by a body of persons employed in establishment acting in combination or concerted refusal, or refusal under a common understanding of any number of persons who are or have been so employed to continue to work or to accept employment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Definition of illegal strike as per IRO, 1969</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">‘Illegal’ strike means a strike declared, commenced or continued otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>When a Strike is not a Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A “strike” is defined in section 25 of the <i>Industrial Relation Ordinance (IRO) </i>1969 as any concerted stoppage of work. There are two questions. What is a ‘stoppage of work’ and what is ‘concerted’. The Labor Court said that concerted means mutually planned and that any refusal to work, if mutually planned, will be within the definition of a strike. A strike is a case where an employee refuses to work for a period of time for which he or she is employed to work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But some methods of conducting a strike are not protected. For example, employees may not stage a “sit-in” in which they take over the employer’s premises and refuse to admit others.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Deliberate slowdowns are also unprotected, as are concerted refusals to work overtime. Picket line violence is another unprotected form of strike activity, and the employer may lawfully discharge (i.e., refuse to reinstate) strikers who assault nonstrikers, or who maliciously destroy property. Minor misconduct, however, will not justify a refusal to re-employ.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A strike may also be unprotected because its objectives are illegal. For example, a strike to force an employer to accept midterm modification of a valid collective bargaining agreement is not protected under the Act<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A union may contractually waive its right to strike in a collective bargaining agreement. Even where the contract does not contain an express no-strike clause, such a promise may be implied quid pro quo for an arbitration provision.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A no-strike clause is generally assumed to prohibit only economic strikes, but a union may also waive its right to strike in protest of unfair labor practices if it does so explicitly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Types of Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most strikes involve actions by labor unions during collective bargaining with an employer. Generally, such actions are rare. According to the <i>News Media Guild</i>, 98%<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a> of union contracts are settled each year without a strike.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A general strike is a strike action by an entire labour force in a city, region or country. In the late 19th century, the growing international labour movements advocated general strikes for industrial or political purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">General strikes are effective because of the wide-reaching disruption they cause. Few official services continue to run in a general strike because other workers will often appeal to other strikers and labour organizations to join the strike.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A large-scale strike, like a general strike, requires a high level of labour organization. Often a galvanizing motive like widespread economic hardship or social unrest is necessary to provoke one. This philosophy was favored especially in the early twentieth century. General strikes were frequent in Spain during the early twentieth century, where revolutionary anarcho-syndicalism was most popular. The biggest general strike in recent European history – in fact the first general wild strike ever – was May 68 in France<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wild-cat Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a strike takes place against the will of the leadership of the union, or without a union, it’s known as a wildcat strike. In many countries, wildcat strikes do not enjoy the same legal protections as standard union strikes, and may result in penalties for the union whose members participate. The same often applies in the case of strikes conducted without an official ballot of the union membership, as required in some countries like the United Kingdom.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sit-down Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A strike may consist of workers refusing to attend work or picketing outside the workplace so as to prevent or dissuade other people from working in their place or conducting business with their employer. Less frequently workers may occupy the workplace, but refuse either to do their jobs or to leave.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sympathy Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A sympathy strike is, in a way, a small scale version of a general strike in which one group of workers refuses to cross a picket line established by another as a means of supporting the striking workers. This strike is initiated by workers in one industry and supported by workers in a separate but related industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jurisdictional Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A jurisdictional strike Jurisdictional strike is a concept in United States labor law that refers to a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a union to assert its member’s right to particular job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Work-to-rule Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A work-to-rule, in which workers perform their tasks exactly as they are required to but no better. For example, workers might follow all safety regulations in such a way that it impedes their productivity, or they might refuse to work any overtime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Such strikes may in some cases be a form of “partial strike” or “slowdown”, which is “unprotected” in some circumstances under United States labor law, meaning that while the tactic itself is not unlawful, the employer may fire the employees who engage in it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Japanese Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A Japanese strike on the contrary has the workers maximizing their output. They are nominally working as usual but the surplus can break the planning, especially in just-in-time systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Green Ban</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the development boom of the 1970s in Australia the <b>Green ban</b> was developed by certain socially more conscious unions. This is a form of strike action taken by a trade union or other organized labor group for environmentalist or conservationist purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Black Ban</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strike action taken against a particular job or employer in order to protect the economic interests of the strikers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Student Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A student strike has the students (sometimes supported by faculty) not attending schools. Unlike other strikes, the target of the protest (the educational institution or the government) does not suffer a direct economical loss but one of public image.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hunger Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A Hunger strike is the voluntary refusal to eat. Hunger strikes are often used in prisons as a form of political protest. Like student strikes, a hunger strike aims to worsen the public image of the target.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strategy for Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Labour strikes are often strengthened by adopting various strategies. Some of the strategies are found to be very effective as follows-</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go-slow</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Go-slow means an organized ,deliberate and purposeful slowing down of normal output of work by a body of workers in a concerted manner, and which is not due to the mechanical defect ,breakdown of machinery, failure or defect in power supply or in the supply of normal material and spare parts of machinery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conducting procession</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Processions are an effective way to raise demands. Most of the times workers are seen to conduct procession to earn their demands. It can be done in both small and large scale depending in which industry it is being done.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Distributing leaflets</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever workers are looking for mass support, distributing leaflets is one of the most effective ways. It informs public about the reason of strike. Sometimes it helps in earning public support thus success becomes easier.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Road block</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A worker sometimes blocks important roads and makes the strike stronger. This strategy is most helpful in case of transportation strikes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Besieging factory</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Besieging the factory is one of the basic strategies of strike. It enables the workers to restrict others entry to the factory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Detaining management representative</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Labors often detain representative of the management to make sure that their voice is hard. It causes severe distraction to the management and immediate consideration of the workers’ demands.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wearing Badges</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Workers sometimes wear badges at their work place or at other times to protest any decision taken by management.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hunger Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is the ultimate strategy to make the decision making authority to fulfill workers’ demands. Sometimes symbolic hunger strike is also conducted. Causes of Strike</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The general causes of strike are as follows-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lay off</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lay off decisions often make workers to call on a strike.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wage increase</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Demand for increasing wage is another reason for strike.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proper working condition</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Workers are sometimes found to do strike demanding a proper working environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management decision</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Decisions taken by management that is not friendly for workers or might cause any harm to the workers may lead to a strike. It includes shutting down the factory; lay off, salary decrease, seasonal work, hiring unskilled labors etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Government decision</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes government decision regarding the industry might cause strike. Government’s decision for shutting down a factory, arresting any labour leader, changing Labour laws etc can lead to such situation. For example, government decision of arresting a transportation worker leader causes a nationwide transportation strike from November 21, 2005 to November 22, 2005.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Managing a Strike</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The most important aspect of managing an economic strike is to prevent it from becoming an unfair labor practices strike. The issue of communications with union members, for instance, is rife with rules that can ensnare the unknowing small business owner. These communication rules apply both to the pre-strike and strike periods. Following are the specific guidelines that small businesses should adhere in negotiating with the union members.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bargain in good faith</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Everybody should continue to bargain in good faith throughout the process. Because both sides have a continuing responsibility to engage in good faith collective bargaining, which means that one must meet with the union with the intent of reaching an agreement about the workers’ demands. Failure to do so also could convert the nature of a strike.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Provide legal information</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provide unions with all information to which they are legally entitled. Under U.S. labor law, unions can request information about management’s plans regarding various operational aspects of the business during the strike. For example, the union can ask for information about where the business plans to get replacement workers and the wages that they will be paid<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Know management rights</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many legal protections are in place to protect workers from unfair management practices, but business owners have rights, too. Businesses can discuss and clarify with striking employees how their proposal differs from that of the union leadership, and they can ask employees to vote to accept the final offer when it’s presented for ratification.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many strike situations also give them the option of utilizing replacement workers without penalty. Nonetheless, businesses should be aware that there are many legal “do’s and don’ts” associated with management-union interactions during collective bargaining and strike periods, and they should make sure that they have adequate legal representation to assist them in this area.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use replacement workers</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes the management of establishments on strike hires workers to do the jobs of the workers on strike. The new workers are known as replacement workers. They are also known as scabs, or scab labor, or strike-breakers. Unionists use the epithet “scab” to refer to workers who are willing to accept terms that union workers have rejected<b>. </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The hiring of replacement workers can complicate the estimation of a strike’s impact. If replacement workers are hired immediately, then the strike will not be reflected at all in economic data. Furthermore, if replacement workers are hired later during the course of an ongoing strike, their presence may falsely indicate that the strike is over even if it is not. To further complicate matters, replacement workers could permanently displace the strikers, or they could instead be just a temporary solution and be laid off when the strike ends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ban of strike in specific professions</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">People in certain professions, particularly those regarded as critical to society, are sometimes prohibited by law from striking. Police, firefighters, and air traffic controllers are among the groups sometimes affected. Occasionally, people in these professions will try to circumvent strike restrictions, such as by falsely claiming inability to work due to illness – this is sometimes called a “sickout”. The term “blue flu” has sometimes been used to describe this action when taken by police officers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lockout of factory</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The counterpart to a strike is a lockout, in which an employer refuses to allow employees to work. Two of the three employers involved in the Caravan park grocery workers strike of 2003-2004 locked out their employees in response to a strike against the third member of the employer bargaining group.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strategy for managing possible threat of strike suggested by Management Support System</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management Support Services (MSS) is a Northwest Indiana based crisis management firm specializing in work stoppage preparations and strategy on a nationwide basis. As strike management specialists, MSS has discreetly and confidentially helped more than 900 companies, ranging from major Fortune 500 corporations to leading mid-size and small privately-held firms face the specter of strike preparedness with confidence and knowledge that if one occurs, management can still maintain operations. The focus of our total strike management services center on the following three interrelated steps:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step 1:</b> Preparation of a comprehensive Work Stoppage Strategy &amp; Planning Manual which is written to meet specific operational needs. Depending on the size of organization, including <i>“how to”</i> counter the <i>“Union Corporate Campaign-Inside Game”</i> strategy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step 2:</b> Provide the necessary technical assistance for arranging food and lodging services, specialized strike-trained security guards to augment existing plant protection force and all types of temporary replacement workers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Step 3:</b> Provide an on-site representative to implement and coordinate all Strike Plan activities should a work stoppage actually occur.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Labor strikes often and unnecessarily cost companies millions. Inadequate strike preparedness is usually the cause<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impact of Strike on Bangladesh Economy</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A strike can have various impacts on employment, average weekly hours, and average hourly earnings. Further, if the company affected by the work stoppage has weekly hours or hourly earnings that differ significantly from the industry average, the strike can have a large impact on average weekly hours or hourly earnings for the industry. Similarly, if the industry involved in the strike has hours and earnings that differ significantly from higher level aggregates, the strike can have an impact on the higher level estimates of average hours or hourly earnings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Change in the number of persons employed</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">While determining the number of persons on payroll, those actually getting paid for work or for leave that occurred during the strike are counted. Thus, persons on strike for the entire period are not counted as employed, because they are not on the payroll. This increases the number of unemployed persons in a particular period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The growth in employment over the month</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The growth in employment over the month is affected by the number of strikers. The employees on strike cause a negative growth in the employment growth indicator.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Effects on hours and earnings estimates</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strikes also affect estimates of workers’ average weekly hours and average hourly earnings. These are hours for which production workers either are paid for work or are on paid leave (including paid vacation, holidays, sick leave, or other paid leave) for the reference pay period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When workers are on strike for an entire pay period, their hours and earnings can be affected in two ways-</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Within industry effects</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the specific industry involved in the strike, estimates are affected only if the hours or earnings of the persons on strike or layoff differ significantly from the industry’s average hours or earnings. The impact is phased in slowly over the months the strike continues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sum across industry effects</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The absence of persons on strike or layoff from payrolls may affect average weekly hours or average hourly earnings at higher levels of industry aggregation. If workers in the specific industry involved in the strike work shorter hours or earn less than workers in other industries in the aggregation, the hours and earnings estimates for the aggregation will be higher. Conversely, if workers in the specific industry involved in the strike work longer hours or earn more than workers in other industries in the aggregation, the hours and earnings estimates for the aggregation will be lower.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Impact on establishment dependent on the striking establishment</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Among the potential secondary effects of a strike is that on establishments which are not on strike, but are dependent on the striking establishment. Competitors taking over market</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another secondary strike effect occurs when competitors of a striking firm add employees to cover additional business foregone by the striking company<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An employee strike is an episode wherein a company’s work force engages in a work stoppage in an effort to elicit changes from its employer in such areas as wages, benefits, job security, and management practices. The beginning of an employee strike is almost always a difficult period for the business owners.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The adversarial nature of such actions can be jarring for company leaders who are unfamiliar with strikes, and the walk-out itself can threaten small-and midsized business owners with devastating economic consequences. Large companies can be hurt by strikes, too, of course, but their very existence is not usually jeopardized. Given this reality, the business owners and their management teams must take steps to ensure that their companies will be able to continue their operations during the strike.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As Brenda Paik Sunoo<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a> wrote in <i>Personnel Journal,</i> “a strike will inevitably pose challenges in many areas: managing contingent workers; setting up communication between management and all employees; maintaining customer service; establishing interim policies regarding benefits, overtime, vacations, and sick leave; and bolstering non-striking employees’ morale. Clearly, those that prepare well in advance will suffer the least trauma during and after a labor dispute.”<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As Bangladesh is a developing country so strike is very fatal for its economic growth. Strikes not only destroy the working spirit of the workers but also demolish the future of the nation. But strike is the only legal way of demonstrating agitation, and grievance towards the anarchy. So it’s the duty of both the management and the worker to solve the dispute and work along with side by side for the betterment of the country.</p><hr/><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> Available at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramses iii</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> Available at: http://encyclopedia.laborlawtalk.com/Industrial_revolution</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> Available at: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1820_Rising</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian Revolution of 1905</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912 Brisbane General Strike</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title="">[7]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg General Strike of 1919</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" title="">[8]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle General Strike of 1919</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" title="">[9]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British General Strike of 1926</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10" title="">[10]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San Francisco general strike of 1934</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title="">[11]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo general strike of 1934</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12" title="">[12]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great Arab revolt of 1936</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13" title="">[13]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french general strike of 1968</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14" title="">[14]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uruguay general strike of 1973</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref15" name="_ftn15" title="">[15]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern Ireland general strike of 1974</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref16" name="_ftn16" title="">[16]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish strike of 1988</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref17" name="_ftn17" title="">[17]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian general strike of 2002</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref18" name="_ftn18" title="">[18]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venezuelan strike 2002-2003</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref19" name="_ftn19" title="">[19]</a> Available at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrain’s orange revolution of 2004</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20" title="">[20]</a> Available at: http://www.sonic.net/~figgins/generalstrike/asia/bangladesh.html</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref21" name="_ftn21" title="">[21]</a> Available at : http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref22" name="_ftn22" title="">[22]</a> Available at: http://www.icra.org/ratingsv02.html</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23" title="">[23]</a> Available at: http://www.constructionlaborlawblog.com/__utm.js</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref24" name="_ftn24" title="">[24]</a> Available at: http://www.rsac.org/ratingsv01.html</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref25" name="_ftn25" title="">[25]</a> Available at: : http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref26" name="_ftn26" title="">[26]</a> Available at: http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/small/Di-Eq/Employee-Strikes.html</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref27" name="_ftn27" title="">[27]</a> Available at: Waidelich, Eric. “Controlling the Strike Zone.” <i>Risk Management.</i> February 1998</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref28" name="_ftn28" title="">[28]</a> Available at: http://www.w3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref29" name="_ftn29" title="">[29]</a> Available at: Sunoo, Brenda Paik. “Managing Strikes, Minimizing Loss.” <i>Personnel Journal.</i> January 1995</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref30" name="_ftn30" title="">[30]</a> Available at: http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/small/Di-Eq/Employee-Strikes.html</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“The award of the Arbitrator is not absolutely immune”. Discuss the grounds when such awards can be nullified by the court and also explain the differences and similarities between Conciliation and Mediation.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>We need to the meaning of an arbitrator must be explained to fully understand the grounds that should be considered by the court to be able to upset an arbitrator’s award. An arbitrator is a neutral person who is chosen to judge a disagreement. An arbitrator could be used to settle any non-criminal dispute, and many business contracts make provisions for an arbitrator in the event of a disagreement. Generally, resolving a disagreement through an arbitrator is substantially less expensive than resolving it through a court of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">‘Arbitration Award’, is referred to as an ‘Award’ even where the entire claimant’s claims fail (and thus no money needs to be paid by either party), or the Award is of a non-monetary nature. Although arbitration awards are characteristically an award of damages against party, tribunals usually has a range of remedies that can form a part of the award:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. the tribunal may order the payment of a sum of money (conventional damages)<br/>2. the tribunal may make a “declaration” as to any matter to be determined in the proceedings<br/>3. in most jurisdictions, the tribunal has the same power as to a court to:<br/>i) order a party to do or refrain from doing something (“injunctive relief”)<br/>ii) to order specific performance of a contract<br/>iii) to order the rectification, setting aside or cancellation of a deed or other document.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arbitration is particularly popular as a means of dispute resolution in the commercial sphere. One of the reasons for doing so is that, in international trade, it is often easier to enforce an arbitration award in a foreign country than it is to enforce a judgment of the court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conciliation is an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process whereby the parties to a dispute (including future interest disputes) agree to utilize the services of a conciliator, who then meets with the parties separately in an attempt to resolve their differences. They do this by lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, providing technical assistance, exploring potential solutions and bringing about a negotiated settlement.<br/>Mediation, as used in law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), a way of resolving disputes between two or more parties. A third party, the mediator assists the parties to negotiate their own settlement (facilitative mediation). In some cases, mediators may express a view on what might be a fair or reasonable settlement, generally where all the parties agree that the mediator may do so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This assignment is presented in a structure as follows: Part I- examines grounds for upsetting an Arbitrator’s Award, Part II- describes issues on conciliation and mediation, Part III lays out differences and similarities between Conciliation and Mediation, Part IV- explores powers of the Court for upsetting the Award of Arbitrator(s) and finally in Part V- offers conclusion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part I. Grounds for upsetting an Arbitrator’s Award</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to The Arbitration Act, 2001 Court has been empowered to set aside/ upsetting arbitral award (in Bangladesh) as under :</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(1) The Court may set aside any arbitral award under this act other than an award made in an international commercial arbitration on the application of a party with in sixty days from the receipt of the award.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) The High Court Division may set aside any arbitral award made in an international commercial arbitration held in Bangladesh on the application of a party with in sixty days from the receipt of the award.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A. Grounds for setting aside arbitral tribunal (in Bangladesh)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An arbitral award may be set aside if-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i ) a party to the arbitration agreement was under some incapacity;<br/>(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it;<br/>(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable due to some reasonable causes to present his case.<br/>(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not failing within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decision on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with the provisions of this Act, or in the absence of such agreement, was not in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) the Court or High Court Divisions, as the case be, is satisfied that-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by the arbitration under the law for the time being in force in Bangladesh ;<br/>(ii) the arbitral award is prima facie opposed to the law for the time being in force in Bangladesh ;<br/>(iii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of Bangladesh ; or<br/>(iv) the arbitral award is induced or affected by fraud or corruption.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Where an application is made to set aside an award, the court or the High Court Division, as the case may be, may order that any money payable by the award shall be deposited in the court or the High Court Division, as the case may be, or otherwise secured pending the determination of the application.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expression “Court” in this section means the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the arbitral award has been finally made and signed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">B. Upsetting of Arbitrator’s Award in abroad</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In United States, as per UAA 1955 or 2000, the grounds for upsetting an Arbitration Award are as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Arbitration Award procured by” corruption, fraud or undue means<br/>Words like “corruption “and “fraud” suggest more than mere wrongdoing.<br/>ii) Evident partiality or corruption. This provision addresses substantive misconduct by the arbitrator.<br/>iii) Arbitrator’s “exceeded their powers” .<br/>iv) Prejudicial misconduct in conducting the Arbitration hearing. This category includes the failure to postpone a hearing despite sufficient cause; failure to hear “evident pertinent and material,” or other Arbitration misconduct prejudicial to the right of a party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Italy, the Award can be challenged under article 829 of the Italian Code of Civil procedure. After the 2006 Reform, the grounds for setting aside the Award are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. If there is an invalid Arbitration agreement, provided that said objection has been raised in the first submission after the arbitrator’s acceptance of the appointment;<br/>2. If the arbitrators have not been appointed according to the provisions of the code of civil procedure provided that said objection has been raised during the arbitral proceedings.<br/>3. If the Award has been rendered by a person who could not be appointed as an arbitrator, as provided for by article 812 of the code of civil procedure;<br/>4. If the Award exceeds the scope of Arbitration agreement, provided that said objection has been raised during the arbitral proceeding; or if the Award decides the merits of the dispute when the merits could not be decided;<br/>5. If the Award does not include the reasons on which the Award is based, the arbitrators’ decision (relief) and the arbitrators’ signature;<br/>6. If the Award has been rendered after the expiration of the time-limit, provided that the party’s intention to set aside the Award on this ground has been notified to others parties and to the arbitrators before the issuing of the Award.<br/>7. If the formalities required by the parties under express sanction of nullity has not been cured.<br/>8. If the Award is contrary to a previous Award or judgment having the force of res judicata between the same parties, provided that said Award or court decision has been brought to the attention of the arbitrators during the proceeding.<br/>09. If the principle of due process has not been observed during the Arbitration Proceedings;<br/>10. If the Award includes the arbitral proceedings without deciding the merits of the dispute and the merits had to be decided;<br/>11. If the Award contains contradictory provisions;<br/>12. If the Award has not pronounced on some of the claims and counterclaims falling under the scope of the Arbitration agreement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Hungary, as per Arbitration Act, 1994, Hungarian court practice in connection with Arbitration, the court may consider only the grounds for annulment that the claimants have explicitly raised by reference to the appropriate provision of the Act. Hungarian Arbitration Act, 1994 which closely follows the UNCITRAL Model Law 1985 .In keeping with this model, the only recourse against an arbitral Award is an application to the competent court to set aside the Award. The grounds for annulment are the same as in Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Model law and Article V of the convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Hungary, the Supreme Court’s position is that if an Award is set aside on the grounds that the composition of the tribunal or the Arbitration procedure was not in accordance with the parties agreement or the act, only the whole Award may be set aside , irrespective of whether the claimant sought only a partial annulment or whether the decisions made in the Award can be separated. For example, if an arbitrator fails to disclose a fact that may call into question his or her independence or impartiality; the entire Award must be set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part II. Issues on conciliation and mediation</strong><br/><strong> A. Conciliation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conciliation is a process in which parties to a dispute with the assistance of a neutral third party identify the disputed issues, develop options, consider alternatives and endeavor to reach an agreement. The Conciliator may have an advisory role in regard to the content of the dispute or the outcome of its resolution, but not a determinative role. The Conciliator may advise on or determine the process of Conciliation whereby resolution is attempted, and may make suggestions or give advice on terms of settlement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B. Mediation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mediation is a process in which parties to a dispute with the assistance of a neutral third party identify the disputed issues, develop options, consider alternatives and endeavor to reach an agreement. The Mediator has no advisory or other determinative role in regard to the content of the dispute or the outcome of its resolution, but may advise on or determine the process of Mediation whereby resolution is attempted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part III-A: Differences between Conciliation and Mediation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Conciliation Mediation<br/>1. As per Indian law, practice of UK &amp; Japan and the UNCITRAL model, the role of the ‘Conciliator’ is pro-active and is somewhat more than the role of a ‘Mediator’. 1. As per Indian law, practice of UK &amp; Japan and the UNCITRAL model, the role of the ‘Mediator’ is not pro-active and is somewhat less than the role of a ‘Conciliator’.<br/>2. In India, under Part III of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 the ’Conciliator’s powers are larger than those of a ‘Mediator’ as he can suggest proposals for settlement 2. In India, ‘Mediator’s powers are limited than those of a ‘Conciliator ’ as he can not suggest proposals for settlement</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. In India, ‘Conciliator’ can make proposals for settlement, ‘formulate’ or ‘reformulate’ the terms of a possible settlement 3. In India, ‘Mediator’ would not do so but would merely facilitate a settlement between the parties.<br/>4. In India, ‘Conciliation’ is a process in which the Conciliator plays a proactive role to bring about a settlement . 4. In India, ‘Mediation’ is “a more passive process” in which the mediator does not play a proactive role to bring about a settlement.<br/>5. From the point of role of a ‘Conciliator’, he/ she is also known as a discussion leader, safety valve, communication link, an innovator, sounding board, stimulator, advisor, face saver, promoter of collective bargaining . 5. From the point of role of a ‘Mediator,’ he/ she is also known as a confidential advisor, facilitator, or an industrial diplomat.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. The definition of ‘Conciliation’ formulated by the ILO (1983) is as follows: “the practice by which the services of a neutral third party are used in a dispute as a means of helping the disputing parties to reduce the extent of their differences and to arrive at an amicable settlement or agreed solution. It is a process of orderly or rational discussion under the guidance of the conciliator.” 6. According to the ACAS, (UK) ‘Mediation’ in this context involves a process in which the neutral “mediator takes a more pro-active role than a conciliator for the resolution of the dispute, which the parties are free to accept or reject .</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. In the USA, the person having the pro-active role is called a ‘ mediator’ rather than a ‘Conciliator’. 7. In the USA, the role of a ‘Conciliator’ is not pro-active.<br/>8. In the USA, the word ‘Conciliation’ has disappeared.<br/>8. In USA, the word ‘Mediation’ has appeared and ‘Mediation’ is used for the neutral who takes a pro-active role. For example:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Whereas the terms ‘Conciliation’ and ‘counseling’ have long since disappeared from the literature in reference to dispute resolution services in the USA and elsewhere, these terms have remained enshrined in Australian family laws, with ‘Mediation’ grafted on as a separate dispute resolution service in 1991.”<br/>9. From the point of procedural activities, in Conciliation the conciliator may not follow a structured process, instead administering the Conciliation process as a traditional negotiation, which may take different forms depending on the case . 9. From the point of procedural activities, in Mediation, the mediator controls the process through different and specific stages: introduction, joint session, caucus, and agreement, while the parties control the outcome.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. ‘Conciliation works are suggestive &amp; advisory . 10. ‘Mediation’ works purely facilitative: the practitioner has no advisory role.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Some Observations on Conciliation and Mediation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">I have thus attempted to clear some of the doubts raised as to the meaning of the words ‘Conciliation’ and ‘Mediation’. Under Indian law, in the context of sec. 30 and sec. 64(1) and sec. 73(1) of the 1996 Act, the conciliator has a greater or a pro-active role in making proposals for a settlement or formulating and reformulating the terms of a settlement. A mediator is a mere facilitator. The meaning of these words in India is the same in the UNCITRAL and Conciliation Rules and in UK and Japan. But, in USA and in regard to certain institutions abroad, the meaning is just the reverse; a ‘Conciliator’ is a mere ‘facilitator’ whereas a ‘mediator’ has a greater pro-active role. While examining the rules made in US in regard to ‘Mediation’, if we substitute the word ‘Conciliation’ wherever the word ‘Mediation’ is used and use the word ‘conciliator’ wherever the word ‘mediator’ is used, we shall be understanding the said rules as we understand them in connection with ‘Conciliation’ in India.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part III-B: Similarities between Conciliation and Mediation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A. Basic similarities between Conciliation and Mediation are narrated below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">01. Both are ADR methods.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">02. Mediator and Conciliator both are neutral and impartial persons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">03. In both cases, a neutral third party seeks to help two or possibly more, opposing sides find a suitable resolution to a conflict.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">04. Mediation and Conciliation provide important benefits to parties and may be seen as complementary to the judicial process .</p><p style="text-align: justify;">05. Disputing parties use Conciliation or Mediation method because both are expeditious, private and generally much less expensive than a trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">06. Conciliation and Mediation both look to maintain an existing business relationship and to rekindle a lost balance of power between two parties. These concepts are sometimes used as synonyms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">07. Conciliation sometimes serves as an umbrella-term that covers all Mediation and facilitative and advisory dispute resolution process, neither process determines an outcome, and both share many similarities. For example, both processes involve a neutral third-party who has no enforcing powers .</p><p style="text-align: justify;">08. Both Mediation and Conciliation serve to identify the disputed issues and to generate options that help disputants reach a mutually- satisfactory resolution. They both offer relatively flexible processes; and any settlement reached should have the agreement of all parties. This contrasts with litigation, which normally settles the disputes in favour of the party with the strongest legal argument. In- between the two operates collaborative law, which uses a facilitative process where each party has counsel.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B. Court-Decision:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the recent Decision Paper by the lord Chancellor’s Department on Alternative Dispute Resolution Where while defining ‘Mediation’ and ‘Conciliation’, it is stated that ‘Mediation’ is a away of settling disputes by a third party who helps both sides to come to an agreement, which each considers acceptable. Mediation can be ‘evaluative’ or ‘facilitative’. ‘Conciliation,’ it is said, is a procedure like Mediation but the third party, the Conciliator, takes a more interventionist role in bringing the two parties together and in suggesting possible solutions to help achieve a settlement. But it is also stated that the term ‘Conciliation’ is gradually falling into disuse and a process which is pro-active is also being regarded as a form of Mediation. This has already happened in USA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part IV: Powers of the court for upsetting the Award of Arbitrator(s)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Legal provisions and Court-decisions regarding upsetting the Award of Arbitrator(s)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>01. State courts can upset an Award if the Award is “in conflict with public policy”.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the arbitrator’s Awards are “in conflict with public policy “of India the Award is to be set aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this connection two notable cases: (1)”SAW PIPES”-Oil &amp;Natural Gas corporation Ltd. v. Saw Pipes and (2) The Venture Global Engineering v. Satyam Computer Services Ltd. may be cited. In SAW PIPES case, the supreme court of India held that the public policy provision of section 34 could be used to set aside an Award “if the Award is contrary to the substantive provisions of law”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Venture Global Engineering v. Satyam Computer Services Ltd the Supreme Court of India held that section 34, which allows Awards to be set aside if they contravene “public policy”, does apply to international Awards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>02. Court can upset an Arbitration Award due to bias</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Alim v. KBR, 2011 WL 61868 , we see one instance where a prior relationship leads to dismissal of an Arbitration Award. The arbitrator, Scott Rosuck did not disclose that he had presided over a prior Arbitration three years prior with KBR, with the same KBR attorney and with the same KBR representative. Mr. Rosuck was required to disclose prior relationships, but did not mention the prior Arbitration. He did say at the beginning of the Arbitration that he had “come across” the lawyer and representative before. But, the Dallas court of appeals found that to be insufficient disclosure to put the employee on notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Rosuck said he relied on memory to check prior conflicts. It appears he had overlooked the prior Arbitration with the same employer, the same employer’s representative and the same employer’s attorney. Obviously, he needs a better system for checking potential issues. The court found this oversight to be “inexcusable.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>03. An Award can be challenged for upsetting by third party whose interest is impacted by arbitral Award</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The cassation court held that a non-party to an Arbitration proceeding may request an arbitral Award be set aside if the party’s rights are affected by the Award. Such affirmation was based on a procedural rule that any person may seek protection of their rights in the state courts. The court held that as long as there is no other way of intervening in Arbitration proceeding, an appeal to set aside the Award is the only way for party to protect its rights. The Russian constitutional court held that one person’s recourse of judicial protection does not breach the constitutional right of the other person to judicial protection. Interference by a third party does not preclude the other party from protecting its rights in the same case. Furthermore, if an Award is annulled, it can always be litigated to protect the infringed rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>o4. An international Arbitration Award can be set aside which based on deficient pleadings</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it isn’t pleaded, you can’t consider it. That in a nutshell appears to be the holding established recently by the Singapore High Court in Kaminski Hotels SA v PT Prima International Development [2011] .That case saw the setting aside of three related international Arbitration Awards on the basis that the tribunal had gone beyond the scope of matters submitted to it by making a decision based on an issue not formally pleaded.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before the Singapore High Court, Kempinski Hotels sought to set aside the Awards on five grounds and failed on all but a pleading point which forms the focus of this note.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The learned Judge’s reasoning can be summarized as follows. Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law provides that an Arbitration Award can be set aside when the matters decided by the tribunal were beyond the scope of the submission to Arbitration. To determine whether matters in an Award were within or outside the scope of submission to Arbitration, a reference to pleadings would usually have to be made. An arbitrator is bound to decide the case in accordance with the parties’ pleadings, and the arbitrator is not entitled to go beyond the pleadings and decide on points which the parties have not given evidence or submissions.<br/>05. Supreme Court Can Strike Down Arbitrator’s Decision Allowing Class Action Arbitration</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In an important decision for domestic and international Arbitrations, the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling on April 27, 2010, striking down an Arbitration panel’s decision that allowed an Arbitration to proceed as a class action where the contract was silent on the issue. Stolt-Nielsen, S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp . The Court emphasized that Arbitration is a product of the parties’ agreement, and it held that the Arbitration panel’s decision ordering class Arbitration where the contract was silent was “fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that Arbitration is a matter of consent.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Part V: Conclusion</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the above discussion ,we may say, the decision of the arbitrator can be upset on grounds of fraud ,corruption, undue means, misconduct by the arbitrator, or refusal to hear pertinent and material evidence, or failure to post phone a hearing despite sufficient cause. An Award can be upset by the state courts if the Award is – ‘in conflict with public policy” or “contrary to substantive provision of law”. Even, an Award can be challenged for up setting by third party whose interests is impacted by arbitral Awards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We may also say, there are some differences and similarities between Conciliation and Mediation. As per Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, UNCITRAL and existing Conciliation Rules in U K and Japan, the ‘ Conciliator’ has a greater pro-active role and ‘mediator’ is a mere ‘ facilitator’ . But in U S A and in regard to certain institutions abroad, the meaning is just the reverse, a ‘ conciliator’ is a mere ‘facilitator’ whereas as a ‘mediator’ has a greater pro-active role. We observe here one noticeable matter is that both are ‘peaceful’ dispute resolution tools that are complementary existing court system. Both methods look to maintain an existing business relationship and to rekindle a lost balance of power between two parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These concepts are sometimes used as synonyms. The aim of both methods is to resolve business disputes quickly for the interest of the business communities of the world. It is more interesting matter that both processes involve a neutral third-party who has no enforcing powers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Bangladesh Government has taken some corrective actions to improve the status and position of indigenous people –illustrate and explain</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh has been the home place of different ethnic groups. In fact, 35 smaller groups of indigenous people or in Bengali Adhibashi covering about 2 percent of the total population have been living in different places of the hilly zones &amp; small areas of the plane lands of the country. Their historical background, economic activities, social structure, religious beliefs &amp; festivals make them distinctive. The terms “indigenous people,” “indigenous ethnic minorities,” and “tribal groups” are used to describe as social groups that share similar characteristics, namely a social and cultural identity that is distinct from dominant groups in society.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Who are indigenous people? </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Wikipedia “Indigenous peoples, or Natives, are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups" title="Ethnic groups">ethnic groups</a> who are native to a land or region, especially before the arrival and intrusion of a foreign and possibly dominating culture. They are a group of people whose members share a cultural identity that has been shaped by their geographical region. Varieties of names are used in various countries to identify such groups of people, but they generally are regarded as the “original inhabitants” of aterritoryor region. Their right to self-determination may be materially affected by the later-arriving ethnic groups<i>.</i>” Therefore, they are the oldest resident in the country. United Nations human rights bodies, ILO, the World Bank and international law apply four criteria to distinguish indigenous people:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Indigenous peoples usually live within (or maintain attachments to) geographically distinct ancestral territories.</li><li>They tend to maintain distinct social, economic, and political institutions within their territories.</li><li>They typically aspire to remain distinct culturally, geographically and institutionally, rather than assimilate fully into a national society.</li><li>They self-identify as indigenous or tribal.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, an undercounting of indigenous people has been reported in the national census. The challenge for liberal groups is to alter this political culture and promote multiculturalism and diversity. Several organizations are working together to protect the rights of indigenous people and to correct the discriminatory policies. The Bangladesh Government has taken some corrective actions to improve their status and position. In recognition of this, in 2009, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a US Congressional body dropped Bangladesh from its Watch List of countries deemed to violate minorities’ rights to religious freedom.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Indigenous people and the constitution of the Bangladesh:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is unfortunate that our constitution has been changed many times. Now it is 15th amendment to the National Constitution of Bangladesh. However, there is no clear Article about the indigenous people. For example, Article 6(2) of the Constitution now says <i>“The people of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangalees as a nation and the citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangladeshis”.</i> So here, the identity of the indigenous people is ignored. Another article (Article 23) says, “<i>The State shall adopt measures to conserve the cultural traditions and heritage of the people, and so to foster and improve the national language, literature and the arts that all sections of the people are afforded the opportunity to contribute towards and to participate in the enrichment of the national culture”. </i>In here, the traditional culture and heritage of indigenous people is not mentioned.Those are some example that in the constitution there is nothing about indigenous people or adibashi. There are also some debatable Articles. For example, The insertion of the phrase “Bismillah?ar?Rahman?ar?Rahim” before the preamble to the constitution was added in the fifth amendment to the Constitution in 1979 by military ruler, General Ziaur Rahman along with the phrase inserting ‘trust and faith in almighty Allah’ in place of ‘secularism’ (Art.8). The eighth amendment to the Constitution, adopted under the military ruler, General Hossain Mohammad Ershad, in 1988, purported to make Islam as the state religion (Article 2A). Both these provisions resulted in the Constitution moving away from one of its founding pillars of ‘secularism’ and becoming clearly discriminatory and public in nature. It is a direct rejection of the full citizenship rights of the hundreds of thousands of people from diverse religions and beliefs who are Bangladeshis. There are estimates of 50?60 indigenous peoples living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) and in the plain lands all over the country. They should be rightfully recognized as ‘indigenous peoples’ in line with the United Nation’s modern accepting of the term based on self?identification, historical continuity with pre?colonial and/or pre?settler societies, strong link to territories, distinct social, economic or political systems, distinct language, culture and beliefs, and their no authority in society.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Indigenous people and the new constitution of Bangladesh:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">30<sup>th</sup> June 2011, the 15th amendment to the National Constitution of Bangladesh, which was passed by the Parliament. This new constitution changes some articles for the indigenous people. For example, the old Article 23 is now changed. The new Article 23A says “<i>The culture of tribes, small ethnic groups, ethnic sects and communities? The state shall take steps to protect and develop the unique local culture and tradition of the tribes [upajati], minor races [khudro jatishaotta], ethnic sects and communities [nrigoshthi o shomprodai]”. </i>By this for the first time the word indigenous use in the constitution of Bangladesh. Therefore, the government finally recognized them. However, this is not enough for their identity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Their status now in Bangladesh:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The status of the indigenous people is not so well. The most populous indigenous peoples in Bangladesh are the Santal (200,000), Chakma (195,000), Marma (66,000) and Mandi (60,000). Of these, the first and last are considered plains-dwelling Adivasis, with the Mandi living in north-central Bangladesh and the Santal in the north-west. In comparison with Bengalis, Adivasis are generally viewed by Bengalis themselves as more open, friendly, generous and honest. They have a strong relationship with the land and there is a deep interrelationship between their religious beliefs (animism) and their social structure. These indigenous people differ in their social organization, marriage customs, birth and death rites, food, and other social customs, from the people of the rest of the country. In the mid-1980s, the percentage distribution of tribal population by religion was Buddhist 44, Hindu 24, Christian 13, and others 19. Time has changed and now we find some disturbing news in newspaper. A report in the Daily Independent, ‘Tribal leaders divided over indigenous issue (30 May 2011), claimed that the indigenous peoples of the CHT (Chittagong Hill Tracts) are ‘divided’ over their identity as indigenous people. The report, wrongfully pointed out that the different indigenous peoples are divided over using the term ‘indigenous’ to be recognized in the Bangladesh Constitution. On 29 April, a demonstration was held in Dhaka with participation from indigenous peoples from all over the country, including the plains where indigenous peoples consistently demanded that they should be recognized in the constitution in a respectful manner and that unacceptable identity be imposed upon them. Although the provisions of the Peace Accord, the Indigenous peoples of CHT continue to suffer from violence, discrimination and exclusion. On 12 July 2006, the army tortured and brutalized a shopkeeper in Mahalchari. Similarly, there are reports of assaults and rape of indigenous women by the settlers or by the army men. A woman from Marma tribe was gang-raped on 30 June 2006. The issues’ relating to land rights of the CHT peoples remains unresolved and indigenous people continue to face further land grabbing by the settler-population. Problems faced by the indigenous population of Bangladesh may be categorized as follows:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>In addition to facing discrimination due to their ethnicity, members of indigenous communities face hardship in education, employment, and everyday life.</li><li>Lands of the indigenous peoples have been violated upon and settled by newcomers. With little legal protection, indigenous peoples can rarely recover the lands they traditionally occupied. Sometimes government agencies in the name of development work take over lands belonging to the indigenous people.</li><li>All over the north of Bangladesh, indigenous people say they are concerned about what they call violation onto their traditional homelands by Bengali settlers.</li><li>Indigenous communities are mostly situated in remote, rural areas, where they lack infrastructure and access to larger markets and proper facilities<a name="_GoBack"></a>.</li><li>Indigenous communities have also played a historically important role in environmental protection. Traditional livelihoods in indigenous communities may depend upon agriculture and raising animals. Environmental damage, therefore, is having a severe impact on their economies.</li><li>Land reform and property laws have restricted some indigenous groups like Khasis at Moulvibazar or Garos at Modhupur, making their traditional occupations untenable.</li><li>As they are, mostly marginalized, indigenous and tribal peoples lack influence in national and even in most local governments, with the limited exception of local governments of Chittagong Hill Districts. Their interests and needs are often ignored by decision-makers.</li><li>Years of discrimination have cast the indigenous people into poverty, thus further damaging their chances at empowerment and opportunities to improve their situation.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Each indigenous community, however small it may be, has a distinctive culture and heritage. The leaders from those communities express concern that those are fading away due to lack of government concern and aggressive activities by sections of local people. They complain that their rights are often violated both by the government and by Bengalis. These can be protected only if the government shows more awareness and sensitivity to indigenous causes, comes forward, and take steps.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conclusion: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh is a poor country, but it may not be wrong to say that, with very few exceptions, Bangladesh’s indigenous peoples are mostly the poorest among the poor. They face undeniable discrimination in education, employment, and civil rights. Decades of violence between indigenous revolts and government security forces in the Chittagong Hill Tracts gave rise to social tensions there, which persist despite the signing of a peace accord nearly fifteen years ago. Accusations of serious human and civil rights abuses against members of indigenous communities surface every now and then. The diversity of our culture due to the presence of indigenous communities is providing extra strength to the national fabric of Bangladesh. Moreover, indigenous people are the original inhabitants of our country. Therefore, they have the same right we have over Bangladesh, if not more.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BIBLIOGRAPHY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">“United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/RES/61/295)”</a>. <i>United Nations</i>.

of the employer to pay compensation.—(1) If a worker is bodily injured by an accident arising out of the course of his employment, his employer shall be liable to pay him compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.</li></ol><p>(2) An employer shall not be liable to pay such compensation, if—</p><ul><li>a worker does not lose the ability to work, in whole or in part, for a period exceeding three days due to injury;</li><li>the cause of injury to a worker, not resulting in death, by the accident directly attributed to—</li><li>the worker having been at that time under the influence of drink or drugs;</li><li>the willful disobedience by the worker of a clear order or to rules made for the purpose of securing the safety of workers; ,</li><li>the willful removal or disregard by the worker of any safety guard or other device which he knew to have been provided for the purpose of securing the safety of workers.</li><li>If—</li><li>any worker, employed in any employment specified in “Part-A” of the Third Schedule, is attacked with any disease specified therein as an occupational disease peculiar to that of employment; or</li><li>a worker, while in the service of an employer for a continuous period of not less than 6 (six) months in any employment specified in Part-B of the Third Schedule, is attacked by any disease specified therein as an occupational disease peculiar to that employment,</li></ul><p>being attacked of such disease shall be deemed to be an injury by accident within the meaning of this section, and, unless the employer proves the contrary, such accident shall be deemed to have arisen out of the course of his employment.</p><p>Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, a period of service shall be deemed to be continuous if the service of the same kind under any other employer is not joined therewith.</p><ul><li>The Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, add any description of employment to the employments specified in the Third Schedule, and in that case, shall specifically mention what shall be the occupational disease peculiar to that employment, and there after the provisions of sub-section (3) shall be so applied as if such disease were declared as occupational disease peculiar to that employment under this Chapter.</li><li>Save as provided by sub-sections (3) and (4), no compensation shall be payable to a worker in respect of any disease unless the disease is directly attributable to an injury by accident arising out of the course of his employment.</li><li>Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to confer any right to compensation on a worker in respect of any injury if he has instituted a suit for damages for such injury in a civil Court against the employer or any other person.</li><li>No suit for damages, in respect of any injury, shall be instituted by a worker in any Court, if—</li><li>he submits an application claiming compensation in respect of such injury before a Labour Court; or</li><li>there is an agreement between him and his employer providing for the payment of compensation in respect of such injury in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.</li><li>For the purposes of this Chapter, “worker” means any person employed by the employer directly or through contractors, who is—</li><li>a railway servant as defined in section 3 of the Railways Act, 1890 (Act No. IX of 1890) (who is not employed in any permanent post of any administrative, district or upazilla office of the railway, and also not employed in any post specified in the Fourth Schedule); or</li><li>employed in any post specified in the Fourth Schedule;</li></ul><p>whether the contract of his employment is oral or in writing, expressed or implied, and any reference to a injured worker shall, if he dies, include his dependents or any of them.</p><p>Explanation.—For the purposes of this Chapter, the exercise of power or performance of duty by a local authority or by any department acting on behalf of the Government shall, unless a contrary intention appears, be deemed to be the trade or business of such authority or department.</p><ol start="151"><li>Amount of compensation.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, the amount of compensation shall be as follows, namely:—</li></ol><ul><li>where death results from the injury, the sum mentioned in the second column of the Fifth Schedule<sup>1</sup> [:]</li></ul><p><sup>2</sup>[Provided that this amount of compensation shall be in addition to the

the worker is adult or minor], the sum</li></ul><p>mentioned in the third column of the Fifth Schedule; and</p><p><sup>4</sup>[(ii) ***]</p><ul><li>where permanent partial disablement results from the injury,—</li><li>in the case of injury specified in the First Schedule, such percentage of the compensation which would have been payable in the case of permanent total disablement which is equal to the ratio specified therein as being the percentage of the loss of earning capacity caused by that injury;</li><li>in the case of an injury not specified in the First Schedule, such percentage of the compensation payable in the case of permanent total disablement as is proportionate to the loss of earning capacity permanently caused by the injury; and</li><li>where temporary disablement, whether total or partial, results from the injury, a monthly compensation shall be payable on the first day of the month following the month in which it is due after the expiry of a waiting period of 4 (four) days from the date of disablement and thereafter shall be payable for the period of disablement or for a period as specified in the last column of the Fifth Schedule, whichever is shorter.</li><li>Where more than 1 (one) injury is caused by the same accident, the amount of compensation payable under sub-section (1)(c) shall be aggregated, but not in such a way as to exceed the amount which would have been payable if permanent total disablement would resulted from the injuries.</li><li>If the disablement ceases before the date on which any monthly compensation is payable, a sum proportionate to the duration of the disablement in that month shall be payable in respect of that month.</li></ul><ol start="152"><li>Method of calculating wages.—(1) For the purposes of this Chapter “monthly wages” means the amount of wages deemed to be payable for work of 1 (one) month, whether the wages is payable by month or by other period or at piece rates.</li></ol><ul><li>Such wages shall be calculated as follows, namely:—</li><li>where the worker was in the service of the employer who is liable to pay compensation for a continuous period of not less than 12 (twelve) months immediately preceding the accident, the monthly wages of the worker shall be ^ (one-twelfth) of the total wage to be paid to him by the employer for the preceding 12 (twelve) months;</li><li>where the worker was in the service of the employer who is liable to pay the compensation for a continuous period of less than 1(one) month immediately preceding the accident, the monthly wage of the worker shall be the sum equal to the monthly average of income which, during the 12 (twelve) months immediately preceding the accident, was being earned by a worker employed on the same work by the same employer, or, if there was no worker so employed, by any other worker employed on similar work in the same locality;</li><li>in other cases, the monthly wages shall be the sum arrived at on the basis of the following calculation:</li></ul><p>30 (thirty) times of the total wages earned from the employer who is liable to pay compensation for a continuous period of service immediately preceding the accident divided by the number of days comprising such period.</p><p>Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, any period of service shall be deemed to be continuous which is not interrupted by a period of absence from work for exceeding 14 (fourteen) days.</p><ol start="153"><li>Review.—(1) Any monthly compensation payable under this Chapter, whether under an agreement between the parties or under an order of the Labour Court, may be reviewed by the Labour Court, if—</li></ol><ul><li>an application is made either by the employer or by the worker accompanied by a certificate of a registered medical practitioner stating that the condition of the worker has been changed; or</li><li>besides such certificate, an application is made either by the employer or by the worker on the ground that the compensation was fixed by fraud or undue influence or other improper means or from the record it is clearly seen that such fixation was wrong.</li><li>Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any monthly compensation may, on review under this section, be continued, increased, decreased or stopped, or if it is found that permanent disablement results from the accident, the monthly compensation payable may be converted to the lump sum to which the worker is entitled, but the sum already received as monthly compensation shall be deducted from it.</li></ul><ol start="154"><li>Payment of monthly compensation by lump-sum.—(1) The employer may pay monthly compensation payable to a worker by paying a lump-sum amount on the basis of the agreement between the parties.</li></ol><p>(2) If there is no such agreement and the payment of compensation continues for not less than 6 (six) months the monthly compensation may be redeemed, on the application of either party, by the payment of such lump sum amount as may be determined by the Labour Court.</p><ol start="155"><li>Distribution of compensation.—(1) No compensation payable in respect of a worker died from injury and no lump sum amount payable as compensation to a person under a legal disability, shall be paid otherwise than by making deposit with the Labour Court.</li></ol><ul><li>If any compensation mentioned in sub-section (1) is paid directly by an employer, it shall not be deemed to be a payment of compensation, unless the concerned worker, during the period of his employment, has nominated in the manner prescribed by rules any of his heirs to receive the compensation in the event of an injury resulting in his death and the compensation is paid to that nominated heir.</li><li>Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in the case of a deceased worker, the employer may make advance payment as compensation to any of his dependents, and the Labour Court shall, deducting such advance from the compensation payable to such dependent, refund it to the employer <sup>1</sup>[:]</li></ul><p><sup>2</sup>[Provided that where, in the case of a deceased worker, any amount is paid for his burial or treatment or carrying of dead body, it shall not be deducted from any amount paid in advance by the employer or from the compensation payable to the dependents through the Labour Court.]</p><ul><li>Any other sum payable as compensation may be deposited with the Labour Court on behalf of the person entitled thereto.</li><li>A receipt given by the Labour Court shall be a sufficient discharge in respect of any compensation deposited with it.</li><li>On the deposit of any money as compensation in respect of a deceased worker under sub-section (1), the Labour Court may, if necessary, by a notice published, or served on each dependent, in such manner as it thinks fit, call upon the dependents to appear before it on such date as it may fix for determining the distribution of the compensation.</li><li>If the Labour Court is satisfied after any enquiry, which it may deem necessary, that there exists no dependent, the Court shall, after not less than 2 (two) years following the date of deposit, transfer the undistributed money deposited with it for the welfare of workers to such fund which the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify or establish.</li><li>The Labour Court shall, on an application by the employer, furnish him a statement showing in detail all disbursements made by it.</li><li>Any compensation deposited in respect of a deceased worker shall, subject to any deduction made under the provisions of sub-section (3), be apportioned among the dependents of the deceased worker or among any of them in such proportion as the Labour Court thinks fit, or the Labour Court may, in its discretion, allot it to any one dependent.</li><li>Where any compensation deposited with the Labour Court is payable to any person, the Labour Court shall, if the person to whom the compensation is payable is not under any legal disability, pay to him, and in other cases, may pay to the person entitled thereto.</li><li>Where any lump sum deposited with the Labour Court is payable to a person who is under a legal disability, such sum may be invested or applied for the benefit of such person during his disability in such manner as the Labour Court may direct.</li><li>Where a half monthly compensation is payable to any person who is under a legal disability, the Labour Court may, on its own or on an application, give order to pay such compensation during his disability to any dependent of the concerned worker or to any other person whom the Labour Court thinks fit to provide for the welfare of such worker.</li><li>Where on an application or otherwise the Labour Court is satisfied that due to negligence of a parent to heir her children, or due to changes of the circumstances of any dependent, or for any other sufficient reason, any order of the Labour Court as to the distribution of any sum paid as compensation or any order of such Court as to the investment or application of any compensation payable to any such dependent is to be varied, the Labour Court may make such order for the variation of its former order as it thinks fit in the circumstances of the case:</li></ul><p>Provided that if such order is prejudicial to any person, such order shall not be made, unless such person has been given an opportunity of showing cause against such order, or in any case in which it is necessary to make repayment by the dependent of any sum already paid to him as compensation.</p><ul><li>Where the Labour Court varies any order under sub-section (13) on the ground that the payment of compensation to any person has been obtained by fraud, impersonation or any other improper means, any compensation so paid may be recovered from him under the provisions of section 329.</li></ul><ol start="156"><li>Prohibition to assign, attach or charge compensation.—Save as provided in this Chapter, any lump sum or monthly compensation payable under this Chapter shall not be assigned, attached or charged, or shall not be transferred to any person other than the worker by operation of any law, or shall not be set off any claim against the same.</li><li>Notice and claim.—No claim for compensation shall be considered by the Labour Court, unless a notice of the accident is given in the manner hereinafter provided as soon as practicable after the occurrence thereof and unless the claim is preferred within 2 (two) years of the occurrence of the accident or in case of death within 2 (two) years of the date of death.</li></ol><ul><li>Where the accident is the contracting of a disease in respect of which the provisions of section 150 (3) is applicable, the accident shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day of the continuous absence of the worker in consequence of the disablement caused by the said disease.</li><li>Any defect or irregularity in or want of a notice shall not be a bar to the consideration of a claim—</li><li>if the claim is preferred in respect of the death of a worker resulting from an accident which occurs—</li><li>on the house or premises of the employer; or</li><li>at the place where the worker was working under the control of the employer or of any person employed by him; and the worker died on such house or premises or place, or died before having left the vicinity of the house or premises or place; or</li><li>if the employer or any person responsible to the employer for the management of the trade or business in which the injured worker was employed had knowledge of the accident from any other source at or about the time when it was occurred.</li><li>The Labour Court may consider and decide any claim to compensation in any case notwithstanding that the notice is not given, or the claim is not preferred, in due time, as provided in the aforesaid sub-section, if it is satisfied that there was sufficient reason for the failure to give such notice or prefer such claim.</li><li>In every such notice the name and address of the person injured shall be mentioned and the cause of the injury and the date of the accident shall be stated in easy language, and shall be served on the employer or upon any person responsible to the employer for the management of the trade or business in which the injured worker was employed.</li><li>A notice under this section shall be served by delivering it at, or sending it by registered post addressed to, the residence or office, or place of business of the person on whom it is to be served, or where a notice-book is maintained, by making an entry in the notice-book.</li></ul><ol start="158"><li>Power to require from employer statement regarding fatal accident.—(1)</li></ol><p>Where a Labour Court receives information from any source that a worker has died as a result of an accident arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, it shall send, by registered post, a notice to the worker’s employer requiring him to submit, within 30 (thirty) days of the service of the notice, a statement, in the form prescribed by rules, giving the reasons and circumstances attending the death of the worker, and indicating whether, in the opinion

deposit within 30 (thirty) days of the service of the notice.</li><li>If the employer is of the opinion that he is not liable to deposit compensation, he shall, in his statement, state the grounds of it.</li><li>Where the employer disclaims his liability as mentioned above, the Labour Court may, after such enquiry as it may think fit, inform any of the dependents of the deceased worker that it is open to the dependents to prefer a claim for compensation, and may provide them such other information, as the Court thinks fit.</li></ul><ol start="159"><li>Report of fatal accident.—Where, by any law for the time being in force, any notice is required to be given to any authority, as to the death resulting from an accident occurring in the house or premises of an employer, the employer or any

such refusal or obstruction, unless, in the case of refusal, he was prevented by sufficient cause from so presenting himself.</li><li>If a worker, before the expiry of the period within which he is supposed to present himself for medical examination under sub-section (1) or (2), voluntarily leaves, without having been so examined, the vicinity of his place of employment, his right to

instructions of such medical practitioner, and if it is proved that the worker has not thereafter been regularly attended by a registered medical practitioner or having been so attended has deliberately failed to follow medical practitioner’s instructions and such refusal, disregard or failure was unreasonable in the circumstances of the case and the injury is aggravated thereby, the injury and the disablement evident from it shall be deemed to be of the same nature and duration as they might have reasonably been expected to be if the worker had been regularly attended by a registered medical practitioner and had followed his instructions, and the compensation, if any, shall be payable accordingly.</li><li>Where any employer or the injured worker is not satisfied with the report of the medical examination by a registered medical practitioner, he may refer the case for re-examination by a medical specialist of at least the rank of an Associate Professor of a Medical

for fixing the compensation.</li></ol><p><sup>2</sup>[(2) Where sub-section (1) applies, all compensation shall be paid by the principal or original employer.</p><p>(3) Where the principal or original employer is of the opinion that the occurrence of death or injury of the concerned worker has been specially and in fact occurred as a result of violation of any rules of conduct on behalf of the contractor, he may, after depositing the full amount of compensation in the Labour Court (in the case of the death of the worker) or after payment of the prescribed amount of money to the worker concerned (in the case of the injury of the worker), apply to the Chief Inspector to determine the share of the said amount which should be paid by the contractor to the principal or original employer, and the Chief Inspector shall, within 45 (forty five) days of receipt of the application, dispose of it according to rules.]</p><ol start="162"><li>Insolvency of the employer.—(1) Where any employer is entered into a contract with any insurer in respect of any liability of the workers under this Chapter, in the event of the employer becoming insolvent or making a scheme of arrangement with his creditors, or if the employer is a company and it commences to be wound up, the right of the employer against the insurer in respect of such liability shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force relating to insolvency or the winding up of a company, be transferred to and vest in the worker, and upon any such transfer the insurer shall

(Act No. III of 1909), or under section 61 of the Insolvency Act, 1920 ( Act No. V of 1920) and under section 230 of the Companies Act, 1994 (Act No. XVIII of 1994), in the case of distribution of the property of the insolvent or in the case of distribution of the assets of the company being wound up and the said Acts shall have effect accordingly.</li><li>Where the compensation is a monthly payment, the amount due in respect thereof shall, for the purposes of this section, be taken to be the amount of the lump sum for which the monthly payment could, if redeemable, be redeemed if application were made for that purpose under section 154, and a certificate of the Labour Court as to the amount of such lump sum shall be conclusive proof thereof.</li><li>The provisions of sub-section (4) shall apply in the case of any amount for which an insurer is entitled to prove under sub-section (3), but such provision shall otherwise not apply where the insolvent or the company being wound up has entered into such a contract with insurer as is referred to in sub-section (1).</li><li>The provisions of this section shall not apply where a company is wound up voluntarily for

that the defendant or the person accused had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness and that the deposition, if taken in a criminal proceeding, was taken in the presence of the person accused

period during which the owner of the ship is, under any law for the time being in force in Bangladesh relating to merchant shipping, liable to defray the expenses of maintenance of the injured master

himself suffers losses or by a dependent] for compensation, for the settlement of any matter by a Labour Court under this Chapter, shall be made, unless the both parties have failed to settle the question raised as to such matter by agreement.</li><li>Power of the Labour Court to require more deposit in cases of fatal accident.—(1) Where any sum is deposited by the employer as compensation payable in respect of a worker whose injury has resulted in death, and in the opinion of the Labour Court such sum is insufficient, the Court may, by notice in writing stating its reasons, call upon

monthly payment or otherwise, or an agreement as to the amount of compensation payable to a person under a legal disability, should not be registered by reason of the inadequacy of the sum or amount or by reason of having been obtained by fraud or undue influence or other improper means; the Court may make such order as to any sum already paid under the agreement, as it thinks just in the

and return to a proper return port, of ship wrecked seamen and of seamen found otherwise in distress at any place outside Bangladesh, and with respect to the circumstances in which, and the conditions subject to which, seamen may be relieved, and provided with passages, and generally for carrying out the purposes of this Chapter ; and a distressed seaman shall not have any right to be relieved, maintained or sent to a proper return port except in the cases and to the extent and on the conditions provided for in such rules.</li></ol><p>Relief and maintenance of distressed seamen</p><ol

conveyance to a proper return port, or in case of death, for his burial, or otherwise in accordance with this Ordinance, those expenses, together with the wages, if any, due to the seaman, shall be a charge upon the ship, whether a Bangladesh ship or not, to which the distressed seaman belonged, and shall be a debt due to the Government from the master of the ship, or from the owner of the ship for the time being, or, where the ship has been lost, from the person who was the owner of the ship at the time of the loss, or where the ship has been transferred to some person not being a citizen

the person, whether principal or agent, who engaged the seamen for service in the ship.</p><ul><li>All excepted expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Government in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance shall constitute a debt due to the Government for which the seaman in respect of whom they were incurred and the owner or agent of the ship to which that seaman belonged at the time of his discharge or other event which resulted in his becoming a distressed seaman shall be jointly and severally liable; and the owner or agent shall be entitled to recover from the seaman any amount paid by the owner or agent to the Government in settlement or part settlement of such debt, and may apply to the satisfaction of claim so much as may be necessary to any wages due to the seaman.</li><li>All excepted expenses incurred in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance in respect of any distressed seaman by the owner or agent of the ship to which the seaman belonged at the time of his discharge or other event which resulted in his becoming a distressed seaman shall constitute a debt due to the owner or agent for which the seaman shall be liable; and the owner or agent may apply to the satisfaction of his claim so much as may be necessary of any wages due to the seaman, but shall not be entitled to recover from the seaman any repatriation expenses other than excepted expenses.</li><li>In any proceedings for the recovery of any expenses which in terms of sub-section (2) or sub section (3) are a debt due to the Government, the production of an account of

the money for his passage, and, as to any part of the route which is by land or air, by paying the expenses of his journey and of his maintenance during the journey or providing him with means to pay those expenses.</li><li>Where the master of a ship is required under this Chapter to provide for the return of a discharged seaman to a proper return port, the master may, instead of providing the seamen’s passage or the expenses of his journey or of providing the seaman with means to pay his passage or those expenses, deposit with the Bangladesh Consular Officer such sum as that Officer considers sufficient to defray the expenses of the return of the seaman to a proper return port.</li></ul><p>Receiving distressed seamen on ships</p><ol start="177"><li>(1) The master of a Bangladesh

to be so made for recognising Bangladesh Load Line Certificates as having the same effect in ports or places of that country as certificates issued under the said provisions; and</p><ul><li>that the said provision for the fixing, marking and certifying of load lines is based on the same principles as the corresponding provisions of this Part relating to load lines and is equally effective, it may, by notification in the official Gazette, direct that Load Line Certificates issued in pursuance of the said provision or in respect of ships of that class or description of ships of that country, shall have the same effect for the purpose of this Part as Bangladesh Load Line Certificates:</li></ul><p>Provided that such direction shall not apply to ships of one hundred and fifty tons gross or upwards belonging to countries to which the Load Line Convention applies, if such ships are engaged in plying on voyages from or to any port or place in Bangladesh to or from any port or place outside Bangladesh.</p><p>Certificates to be produced to Customs by ships belonging to non-Convention countries</p><ol start="344"><li>The master of every ship belonging to a country to which the Load Line Convention does not apply shall produce to the Collector of Customs from whom a port clearance for the ship is sought, either a Bangladesh Load Line Certificate or a certificate having effect under this Ordinance as such a certificate, being a certificate for the time being in force in respect of the ship, and port clearance shall not be granted and the ship may be detained until the certificate required by this section is so produced.</li></ol><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>CARRIAGE OF SPECIAL CARGOES</p><p>Power to make rules as to deck cargo</p><ol start="345"><li>(1) The Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, make rules hereinafter referred to as “the deck cargo rules” prescribing requirements to be complied with where cargo is carried in any uncovered space on the deck of a Bangladesh ship or any other ship within any port or place in Bangladesh; and different requirements may be so prescribed in relation to different descriptions of ships, different descriptions of cargo, different voyages or classes of voyages, different seasons of the year or any other different circumstances.</li></ol><ul><li>If the load line rules provide, either generally or in particular cases or classes of cases, for assigning special free boards to ships which are to have effect only where a cargo of timber is so carried, then, without prejudice to the generality of the preceding sub section, the deck cargo rules may prescribe special requirements to be complied with in circumstances where any such special free board has effect.</li><li>If any provision of the deck cargo rules are contravened-</li><li>in the case of a Bangladesh ship, or</li><li>in the case of any other ship while the ship is within any port or at any place in Bangladesh, the master or owner of the ship shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand Taka.</li><li>Where a person is charged with an offence under the last preceding sub section, it shall be a defence to prove that the contravention was due solely to deviation or delay and that the deviation or delay was caused solely by stress of weather or other circumstances which neither the master nor the owner nor the charterer, if any, could have prevented or forestalled.</li><li>For the purpose of securing compliance with the deck cargo rules, any Surveyor authorised in that behalf by the Government may inspect any ship which is carrying cargo in any uncovered space on her deck.</li></ul><p>Tonnage of spaces occupied by deck cargo to be added to registered tonnage</p><ol start="346"><li>(1) If any ship, either Bangladesh or foreign, other than a coasting ship or home trade ship, carries as deck cargo, that is to say, in any uncovered space upon deck, or in any covered space not included in the cubical contents forming the ship’s registered tonnage, and not exempted by regulations under this Ordinance, timber, stores or other goods, all dues payable on the ship’s tonnage shall be payable as if there were added to the ship’s registered tonnage, the tonnage of the space occupied by those goods at the time at which the goods become payable.</li></ol><ul><li>The space so occupied shall be deemed to be the space limited by the area occupied by the goods and by straight lines enclosing a rectangular space sufficient to include the goods.</li><li>The tonnage of the space shall, for the purpose of this section, be ascertained by an officer of the Customs and when so ascertained shall be entered by him in a memorandum which he shall deliver to the master, and the master shall, when the said dues are demanded, produce that memorandum in like manner as if it were the certificate of registry, or, in the case of a foreign ship, the document equivalent to a certificate of registry, and in default, shall be liable to pay the same penalty as if he had failed to produce the said certificate or document.</li></ul><p>Carriage of dangerous goods</p><ol start="347"><li>(1) The Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, make rules for regulating, in the interests of safety, the carriage of dangerous goods in ships, or adopt, with or without modification, any rules, regulations or codes relating to the carriage of such goods made by any other country or any international organisation and the provisions of the rules, regulations or codes so adopted shall have effect as if they were rules made under this sub section.</li></ol><ul><li>In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for the classification of such goods, the packing, marking and stowing of such goods or any class of such goods, and the fixing of the maximum quantity of any such class of goods which may be carried in different ships or classes of ships.</li><li>The owner, master or agent of a ship carrying or intending to carry any dangerous goods as cargo and about to make a voyage from a port or place in Bangladesh shall furnish in advance the prescribed particulars of the ship and the cargo to the Principal Officer or to such other officer as may be specified for the purpose.</li><li>A Surveyor may inspect the ship for the purpose of ensuring that the rules made under this section are complied with.</li><li>If any of the rules made under this section is not complied with in relation to any ship, the owner or master of the ship shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to twenty thousand Taka, or with both, and the ship shall be deemed for purposes of this Part to be an unsafe ship.</li></ul><p>Explanation. In this section, the expression “dangerous goods” means goods which by reason of the nature, quantity or mode of stowage are either singly or collectively liable to endanger the life or the health of person on or near the ship or to imperil the ship, and includes all substances within the meaning of the expression “explosives” as defined in the Explosives Act, 1884 (IV of 1884), and any other goods which the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, specify as dangerous goods, but shall not include any fog or distress signals or like equipment required to be carried by the ship under this Ordinance or the rules or regulations made thereunder.</p><p>Carriage of grain</p><ol start="348"><li>(1) Where grain is loaded on board any Bangladesh ship or is loaded on board any ship within any port or place in Bangladesh, all necessary and reasonable precautions shall be taken to prevent the grain from shifting; and if such precautions are not taken, the owner or the master of the ship or any agent of the owner who was charged with the loading or with sending the ship to sea laden with grain shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five thousand Taka, and the ship shall be deemed for the purposes of this Part to be unsafe by reason of improper loading.</li></ol><ul><li>Where any ship which is loaded with grain outside Bangladesh without all necessary and reasonable precautions having been taken to prevent the grain from shifting, enters any port or place in Bangladesh so laden, the owners or the master of the ship shall be punishable with fine which may extend to Taka ten thousand, and the ship shall be deemed for the purpose of this Part to be unsafe by reason of improper loading:</li></ul><p>Provided that this sub section shall not apply to a ship which would not have entered any such port or place but for stress of weather or any other circumstances that neither the master nor the owner nor the charterer, if any, could have prevented or forestalled.</p><ul><li>On the arrival at a port or place in Bangladesh from a port or place outside Bangladesh of any ship carrying a cargo of grain, the master shall cause to be delivered at the office of the Principal Officer or to such other officer as may be specified by the Government in this behalf, a notice stating­-</li><li>the draught of water and free board of the said ship after the loading of the cargo was completed at the final port of loading; and</li><li>the following particulars of the grain carried, namely:</li><li>the kind of grain and quantity thereof stated in cubic feet, quarters, bushels or tons weight;</li><li>the mode in which the grain is stowed; and</li><li>the precautions taken to prevent the grain from shifting.</li><li>If the master fails to deliver the notice required by sub section (3), or if in any such notice makes any statement that he knows it to be false in a material particular, or recklessly makes a statement that is false in a material particular, he shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five thousand Taka.</li><li>A Surveyor or any other person authorised in this behalf by general or special order of the Government may, for securing the observance of the provisions of this section, inspect a ship carrying a cargo of grain and the mode in which such cargo is stowed therein.</li><li>The Government may make rules prescribing in relation to loading of ships generally or of ships of any class the precautions to be taken, and when such precautions have been prescribed, they shall be treated for the purposes of this section to be included in the expression “necessary and reasonable precautions”.</li><li>In this section, the expression “grain” includes wheat, maize, oats, rye, barley, rice, pulses and seeds and processed forms thereof whose behaviour is similar to that of grain in its natural state.</li></ul><p>Carriage of bulk cargoes other than grain, etc</p><ol start="349"><li>(1) The Government may make rules in relation to the loading of bulk cargoes, other than grain as defined in sub section (7) of section 348 and oil in bulk, on any Bangladesh ship or in any ship within any port or place in Bangladesh.</li></ol><p>(2) The owner or master of a ship in respect of which the provisions of any of the rules made under sub section (1) are contravened shall be punishable with fine which may extend to ten thousand Taka.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>UNSEAWORTHY AND UNSAFE SHIPS</p><p>Unseaworthy ships</p><ol start="350"><li>A ship is “unseaworthy” within the meaning of this Ordinance when the materials of which she is made, her construction, the qualifications of the crew including officers, the weight, description and stowage of the cargo and ballast, the condition of her hull and equipment, boilers and machinery are not such as to render her in every respect fit for the proposed voyage or service.</li></ol><p>Unseaworthy ship not to be sent to sea</p><ol start="351"><li>(1) Every person who sends or attempts to send a Bangladesh ship to sea from any port or place in Bangladesh in such an unseaworthy state that the life of any person is likely to be thereby endangered shall, unless he proves that he used all reasonable means to ensure her being sent to sea in a seaworthy state, or that her going to sea in such an unseaworthy state was under the circumstances reasonable and justifiable, be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to forty thousand Taka, or with both.</li></ol><ul><li>Every master of a Bangladesh ship who knowingly takes such ship to sea in such unseaworthy state that the life of any person is likely to be thereby endangered shall, unless he proves that her going to sea in such unseaworthy state was, under the circumstances reasonable and justifiable, be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to forty thousand Taka, or with both.</li><li>For the purpose of giving such proof, every person charged under this section may give evidence in the same manner as any other witness.</li><li>No prosecution under this section shall be instituted except by, or with the consent of, the Government.</li></ul><p>Obligation of owner to crew with respect to seaworthiness</p><ol start="352"><li>(1) In every contract of service, express or implied, between the owner of a Bangladesh ship and the master or any seaman thereof, and in every contract of apprenticeship whereby any person is bound to serve as an apprentice on board any such ship, there shall be implied, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, an obligation on the owner that such owner and the master, and every agent charged with the loading of such ship or the preparing thereof for sea, or the sending thereof to sea, shall use all reasonable means to ensure the seaworthiness of such ship for the voyage at the time when such voyage commences, and to keep her in a seaworthy state during the voyage.</li></ol><ul><li>For the purpose of seeing that the provisions of this section have been complied with, the Government may, either at the request of the owner or otherwise, arrange for a survey of the hull, equipment or machinery of any sea-going ship by a Surveyor.</li></ul><p>Power to detain unsafe ship and procedure for detention</p><ol start="353"><li>(1) Where a Bangladesh ship in any port or place to which the Government may specially extend this section is an unsafe ship, that is to say, is by reason of the defective condition of her hull, equipment or machinery, or by reason of under-manning or by reason of overloading or improper loading, unfit to proceed to sea without serious danger to human life, having regard to the nature of the service for which she is intended, such ship may be provisionally detained for the purpose of being surveyed or for ascertaining the sufficiency of her crew and either finally detained or released as follows, namely:-</li></ol><ul><li>the Government, if it has reason to believe, on complaint or otherwise, that any such ship is unsafe, may order the ship to be provisionally detained as an unsafe ship for the purpose of being surveyed;</li><li>a written statement of the grounds of such detention shall be forthwith served on the master of such ship;</li><li>when the Government orders that a ship be provisionally detained, it shall either refer the matter to the Court of Survey for the Port where the ship is detained, or forthwith appoint some competent person to survey such ship and report thereon; and, on receiving the report, may either order the ship to be released or, if in its opinion the ship is unsafe, may order her to be finally detained, either absolutely or until the performance of such conditions with respect to the execution of repairs or alterations, or the unloading or reloading of cargo, as the Government thinks necessary for the protection of human life;</li><li>before an order for final detention is made, a copy of the report shall be served upon the master of the ship, and within seven days after such service, the owner or master may appeal against such report, in the manner prescribed, to the Court of Survey for the port where the ship is detained;</li><li>where a ship has been provisionally detained and a person has been appointed under this section to survey such ship, the owner or master of the ship, at any time before such person makes that survey, may require that he shall take with him as assessor such person as the owner or master may select, being a person named in the list of assessors for the Court of Survey or, if there is no such list, or if it is impracticable to procure the attendance of any person named in such list, a person of nautical, engineering or other special skill and experience; if the Surveyor and assessor agree that the ship should be detained or released, the Government shall cause the ship to be detained or released accordingly, and the owner or master shall have no right of appeal; if the Surveyor and assessor differ in their report, the Government may act as if the requisition had not been made, and the owner or master shall have a right of such appeal touching the report of the Surveyor as is hereinbefore provided in this section;</li><li>where a ship has been provisionally detained, the Government may, at any time, if it thinks fit expedient, refer the matter to the Court of Survey for the port where the ship is detained; and</li><li>the Government may, at any time, if satisfied that a ship detained under this section is not unsafe, order her to be released either with or without any conditions.</li></ul><p>(2) A Principal Officer or any other person appointed by the Government for the purpose, in this Ordinance referred to as a Detaining Officer, shall have the same power as the Government has under this section of ordering that a ship be provisionally detained for the purpose of being surveyed, and of appointing a person to survey her; and, if he thinks that a ship so detained by him is not unsafe, a Detaining Officer may order her to be released.</p><ul><li>A Detaining Officer shall forthwith report to the Government any order made by him for the detention or release of a ship.</li><li>A ship detained under this section shall not be released by reason of her ceasing to be a Bangladesh ship subsequent to her detention.</li><li>A Detaining Officer may, for the purpose of this Part,-</li><li>go on board any ship and may inspect the same or any part thereof, or any of the machinery, equipment and cargo on board thereof, and require the unloading or removal of any cargo, ballast or tackle, not unnecessarily detaining or delaying her from discharging, unloading or proceeding on any voyage;</li><li>by summons under his hand, require the attendance of all such persons as he thinks fit to call before him, examine such persons, and, by a like summons, require returns in writing to any inquiries he thinks fit to make;</li><li>require and enforce the production of all books, papers or documents which he considers important; and</li><li>administer oaths, or, in lieu of administering an oath, require every person examined by him to make and subscribe a declaration of the truth of the statements made by him in his examination.</li></ul><p>Liability of Government for cost and damages to a ship wrongly detained</p><ol start="354"><li>If it appears that there was not reasonable and probable cause, by reason of the condition of the ship or the act or default of the owner or the master, for the provisional detention of a ship, the Government shall be liable to pay to the owner of the ship his costs of and incidental to the detention and survey of the ship, and also compensation for any loss or damage sustained by him by reason of the detention or survey</li></ol><p>Liability of ship-owner for costs

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Venkatesh Nayak</p><div class="summary" data-sprawk-mtlangs=""><div class="field field--name-field-summery field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field--item"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>The debate on the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution, lying somnolent in the archives of India’s constitutional history during the last decade of the 20th century, has reappeared in the public realm.While setting up the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (the Commission), the National Democratic Alliance government (formed by a coalition of 24 national and regional level parties) stated that the basic structure of the Constitution would not be tampered with. Justice M.N. Venkatachalaiah, Chairman of the Commission, has emphasised on several occasions that an inquiry into the basic structure of the Constitution lay beyond the scope of the Commission’s work.</p><p>Several political parties — notably the Congress (I) and the two Communist parties which are in the opposition — have made it clear that the review exercise was the government’s ploy to seek legitimacy for its design to adopt radical constitutional reforms thus destroying the basic structure of the document.</p><p>Much of the public debate has been a victim of partial amnesia as even literate circles of urban India are unsure of the ramifications of this concept, which was hotly debated during the 1970s and 1980s. The following discussion is an attempt to chart the waters of that period rendered turbulent by the power struggle between the legislative and the judicial arms of the State.</p><p>According to the Constitution, Parliament and the state legislatures in India have the power to make laws within their respective jurisdictions. This power is not absolute in nature. The Constitution vests in the judiciary, the power to adjudicate upon the constitutional validity of all laws. If a law made by Parliament or the state legislatures violates any provision of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the power to declare such a law invalid or ultra vires. This check notwithstanding, the founding fathers wanted the Constitution to be an adaptable document rather than a rigid framework for governance. Hence Parliament was invested with the power to amend the Constitution. <strong>Article 368</strong> of the Constitution gives the impression that Parliament’s amending powers are absolute and encompass all parts of the document. But the Supreme Court has acted as a brake to the legislative enthusiasm of Parliament ever since independence. With the intention of preserving the original ideals envisioned by the constitution-makers, the apex court pronounced that Parliament could not distort, damage or alter the basic features of the Constitution under the pretext of amending it. The phrase ‘basic structure’ itself cannot be found in the Constitution. The Supreme Court recognised this concept for the first time in the historic Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973.[1] Ever since the Supreme Court has been the interpreter of the Constitution and the arbiter of all amendments made by Parliament.</p><p><strong>The pre-Kesavanada position</strong></p><p>Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution, particularly the chapter on the fundamental rights of citizens, was challenged as early as in 1951. After independence, several laws were enacted in the states with the aim of reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. This was in keeping with the ruling Congress party’s electoral promise of implementing the socialistic goals of the Constitution[contained in <strong>Article 39</strong> (b) and (c) of the <strong>Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>] that required <strong>equitable distribution of resources of production among all citizens and prevention of concentration of wealth in the hands of a few</strong>. Property owners — adversely affected by these laws — petitioned the courts. The courts struck down the land reforms laws saying that they transgressed the fundamental right to property guaranteed by the Constitution. Piqued by the unfavourable judgements, Parliament placed these laws in the <strong>Ninth Schedule</strong> of [2] the Constitution through the<strong> First and Fourth amendments </strong>(1951 and 1952 respectively), thereby effectively removing them from the scope of judicial review.</p><p>[Parliament added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution through the very first amendment in 1951as a means of immunising certain laws against judicial review. Under the provisions of Article 31,which themselves were amended several times later, laws placed in the Ninth Schedule — pertaining to acquisition of private property and compensation payable for such acquisition — cannot be challenged in a court of law on the ground that they violated the fundamental rights of citizens. This protective umbrella covers more than 250 laws passed by state legislatures with the aim of regulating the size of land holdings and abolishing various tenancy systems. The Ninth Schedule was created with the primary objective of preventing the judiciary – which upheld the citizens’ right to property on several occasions – from derailing the Congress party led government’s agenda for a social revolution.[3] ]</p><p>Property owners again challenged the constitutional amendments which placed land reforms laws inthe Ninth Schedule before the Supreme Court, saying that they violated Article 13 (2) of the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Article 13 (2) </strong>provides for the protection of the fundamental rights of the citizen.[4] Parliament and thestate legislatures are clearly prohibited from making laws that may take away or abridge the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizen. They argued that any amendment to the Constitution had the status of a law as understood by <strong>Article 13 (2)</strong>. In 1952 (Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Unionof India [5]) and 1955 (Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan[6]), the Supreme Court rejected both arguments and upheld the power of Parliament to amend any part of the Constitution including that which affects the fundamental rights of citizens. Significantly though, two dissenting judges in Sajjan Singh v.Rajasthan case raised doubts whether the fundamental rights of citizens could become a plaything of the majority party in Parliament.</p><p><strong>The Golaknath verdict</strong></p><p>In 1967 an eleven-judge bench of the Supreme Court reversed its position. Delivering its 6:5 majority judgement in the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case [7], <strong>Chief Justice Subba Rao</strong> put forth the curious position that Article 368, that contained provisions related to the amendment of the Constitution,merely laid down the amending procedure.<strong> Article 368</strong> did not confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution. The amending power (constituent power) of Parliament arose from other provisions contained in the Constitution (<strong>Articles 245, 246, 248</strong>) which gave it the power to make laws (plenary legislative power). Thus, the apex court held that the amending power and legislative powers of Parliament were essentially the same. Therefore, any amendment of the Constitution must be deemed law as understood in<strong> Article 13 (2)</strong>.</p><p>The majority judgement invoked the concept of <strong>implied limitations on Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution</strong>. This view held that the Constitution gives a place of permanence to the fundamental freedoms of the citizen. In giving the Constitution to themselves, the people had reserved the fundamental rights for themselves. <strong>Article 13</strong>, according to the majority view, expressed this limitation on the powers of Parliament. Parliament could not modify, restrict or impair fundamental freedoms due to this very scheme of the Constitution and the nature of the freedoms granted under it. The judges stated that the fundamental rights were so sacrosanct and transcendental in importance that they could not be restricted even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval of both houses of Parliament. They observed that a Constituent Assembly migh tbe summoned by Parliament for the purpose of amending the fundamental rights if necessary.</p><p><strong>In other words, the apex court held that some features of the Constitution lay at its core and required much more than the usual procedures to change them.</strong></p><p>The phrase ‘<strong>basic structur</strong>e’ was introduced for the first time by M.K. Nambiar and other counsels while arguing for the petitioners in the Golaknath case, but it was only in 1973 that the concept surfaced in the text of the apex court’s verdict.</p><p><strong>Nationalisation of Banks and Abolition of Privy Purses</strong></p><p>Within a few weeks of the Golaknath verdict the Congress party suffered heavy losses in the parliamentary elections and lost power in several states. Though a private member’s bill – tabled by Barrister Nath Pai – seeking to restore the supremacy of Parliament’s power to amend the Constitutionwas introduced and debated both on the floor of the house and in the Select Committee, it could notbe passed due to political compulsions of the time. But the opportunity to test parliamentary supremacy presented itself once again when Parliament introduced laws to provide greater access to bank credit for the agricultural sector and ensure equitable distribution of wealth and resources of production and by:</p><p>a) nationalising banks and</p><p>b) derecognising erstwhile princes in a bid to take away their Privy purses, which were promised inperpetuity – as a sop to accede to the Union – at the time of India’s independence.</p><p>Parliament reasoned that it was implementing the <strong>Directive Principles of State Policy</strong> but the Supreme Court struck down both moves. By now, it was clear that the Supreme Court and Parliament were at loggerheads over the relative position of the <strong>fundamental rights</strong> vis-à-vis the Directive Principles of State Policy.At one level, the battle was about the supremacy of Parliament vis-à-vis the power of the courts to interpret and uphold the Constitution.</p><p>At another level the contention was over the sanctity of property as a fundamental right jealously guarded by an affluent class much smaller than that of the large impoverished masses for whose benefit the Congress government claimed to implement its socialist development programme.</p><p>Less than two weeks after the Supreme Court struck down the President’s order derecognising the princes, in a quick move to secure the mandate of the people and to bolster her own stature Prime Minister Indira Gandhi dissolved the Lok Sabha and called a snap poll.</p><p>For the first time, the Constitution itself became the electoral issue in India. Eight of the ten manifestos in the 1971 elections called for changes in the Constitution in order to restore the supremacy of Parliament. A.K. Gopalan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) went to the extent of saying that the Constitution be done away with lock stock and barrel and be replaced with one that enshrined the real sovereignty of the people[8]. The Congress party returned to power with a two-thirds majority. The electorate had endorsed the Congress party’s socialist agenda, which among other things spoke of making basic changes to the Constitution in order to restore Parliament’s supremacy.</p><p>Through a spate of amendments made between July 1971 and June 1972 Parliament sought to regain lost ground. It restored for itself the absolute power to amend any part of the Constitution including Part III, dealing with fundamental rights.[9] Even the President was made duty bound to give his assent to any amendment bill passed by both houses of Parliament. Several curbs on the right property were passed into law. The <strong>right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws (Article 14)</strong> and the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Article 19[10] were made subordinate to <strong>Article 39</strong> (b) &amp; (c) in the <strong>Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>.[11] Privy purses of erstwhile princes were abolished and an entire category of legislation dealing with land reforms was placed in the<strong> Ninth Schedule</strong> beyond the scope of judicial review.[12]</p><p><strong>Emergence of the Basic Structure Concept- the Kesavanada milestone</strong></p><p>Inevitably, the constitutional validity of these amendments was challenged before a full bench of the Supreme Court (thirteen judges). Their verdict can be found in eleven separate judgements.[13] Nine judges signed a summary statement which records the most important conclusions reached by them in this case. Granville Austin notes that there are several discrepancies between the points contained in the summary signed by the judges and the opinions expressed by them in their separate judgements.[14] Nevertheless, the seminal concept of ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution gained recognition in the majority verdict.</p><p>All judges upheld the validity of the <strong>Twenty-fourth</strong> amendment saying that Parliament had the power to amend any or all provisions of the Constitution. All signatories to the summary held that the Golaknath case had been decided wrongly and that <strong>Article 368</strong> contained both the power and the procedure for amending the Constitution.</p><p>However they were clear that an amendment to the Constitution was not the same as a law as understood by<strong> Article 13 (2)</strong>.</p><p>[It is necessary to point out the subtle difference that exists between two kinds of functions performed by the Indian Parliament:</p><p>a) it can make laws for the country by exercising its legislative power[15] and</p><p>b) it can amend the Constitution by exercising its constituent power.</p><p><strong>Constituent power is superior to ordinary legislative power.</strong> Unlike the British Parliament whichis a sovereign body (in the absence of a written constitution), the powers and functions of the IndianParliament and State legislatures are subject to limitations laid down in the Constitution. TheConstitution does not contain all the laws that govern the country. Parliament and the statelegislatures make laws from time to time on various subjects, within their respective jurisdictions. Thegeneral framework for making these laws is provided by the Constitution. Parliament alone is given the power to make changes to this framework under <strong>Article 368 </strong>[16]. Unlike ordinary laws,amendments to constitutional provisions require a special majority vote in Parliament.</p><p>Another illustration is useful to demonstrate the difference between Parliament’s constituent powerand law making powers. According to <strong>Article 21</strong> of the Constitution, <strong>no person in the country maybe deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law</strong>. The Constitution does not lay down the details of the procedure as that responsibility is vested withthe legislatures and the executive. Parliament and the state legislatures make the necessary lawsid entifying offensive activities for which a person may be imprisoned or sentenced to death. The executive lays down the procedure of implementing these laws and the accused person is tried in acourt of law. Changes to these laws may be incorporated by a simple majority vote in the concernedstate legislature. There is no need to amend the Constitution in order to incorporate changes to theselaws. However, if there is a demand to convert<strong> Article 21</strong> into the fundamental right to life byabolishing death penalty, the Constitution may have to be suitably amended by Parliament using itsconstituent power.</p><p>Most importantly seven of the thirteen judges in the Kesavananda Bharati case, including <strong>Chief Justice Sikri</strong> who signed the summary statement, declared <strong>that Parliament’s constituent powerwas subject to inherent limitations</strong>. Parliament could not use its amending powers under<strong> Article 36</strong>8 to <strong>‘damage’, ’emasculate’, ‘destroy’, ‘abrogate’, ‘change’ </strong>or<strong> ‘alter’ the ‘basic structure’</strong> or framework of the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Basic Features of the Constitution according to the Kesavanada verdict</strong></p><p>Each judge laid out separately, what he thought were the basic or essential features of the Constitution. There was no unanimity of opinion within the majority view either.</p><p><strong>Sikri, C.J.</strong> explained that the concept of basic structure included:</p><p>• supremacy of the Constitution</p><p>• republican and democratic form of government</p><p>• secular character of the Constitution</p><p>• separation of powers between the legislature, executive and the judiciary</p><p>• federal character of the Constitution</p><p><strong>Shelat, J. </strong>and<strong> Grover, J.</strong> added two more basic features to this list:</p><p>• the mandate to build a welfare state contained in the Directive Principles of State Policy</p><p>• unity and integrity of the nation</p><p><strong>Hegde, J.</strong> and <strong>Mukherjea, J.</strong> identified a separate and shorter list of basic features:</p><p>• sovereignty of India</p><p>• democratic character of the polity</p><p>• unity of the country</p><p>• essential features of the individual freedoms secured to the citizens</p><p>• mandate to build a welfare state</p><p><strong>Jaganmohan Reddy, J.</strong> stated that elements of the basic features were to be found in the <strong>Preamble</strong> of the Constitution and the provisions into which they translated such as:</p><p>• sovereign democratic republic</p><p>• parliamentary democracy</p><p>• three organs of the State</p><p><strong>He said that the Constitution would not be itself without the fundamental freedoms and the directive principles.[17]</strong></p><p><strong>Only six judges on the bench (therefore a minority view) agreed that the fundamental rights o fthe citizen belonged to the basic structure and Parliament could not amend it.</strong></p><p><strong>The minority view</strong></p><p>The minority view delivered by <strong>Justice A.N. Ray</strong> (whose appointment to the position of Chief Justice over and above the heads of three senior judges, soon after the pronunciation of the Kesavanand averdict, was widely considered to be politically motivated), <strong>Justice M.H. Beg</strong>, <strong>Justice K.K. Mathew</strong> and <strong>Justice S.N. Dwived</strong>i also agreed that Golaknath had been decided wrongly. They upheld the validity of all three amendments challenged before the court.<strong> Ray, J.</strong> held that all parts of the Constitution were essential and no distinction could be made between its essential and non-essential parts. All of them agreed that Parliament could make fundamental changes in the Constitution by exercising its power under <strong>Article 368</strong>.</p><p>In summary the majority verdict in Kesavananda Bharati recognised the power of Parliament to amend any or all provisions of the Constitution <strong>provided such an act did not destroy its basic structure</strong>. But there was no unanimity of opinion about what appoints to that basic structure. Though the Supreme Court very nearly returned to the position of Sankari Prasad (1952) by restoring the supremacy of Parliament’s amending power, in effect <strong>it strengthened the power of judicial review much more</strong>.[18]</p><p><strong>Basic Structure concept reaffirmed- the Indira Gandhi Election case</strong></p><p>In 1975, The Supreme Court again had the opportunity to pronounce on the basic structure of the Constitution. A challenge to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s election victory was upheld by the Allahabad High Court on grounds of electoral malpractice in 1975. Pending appeal, the vacation judge- Justice Krishna Iyer, granted a stay that allowed Smt. Indira Gandhi to function as Prime Minister on the condition that she should not draw a salary and speak or vote in Parliament until the case was decided. Meanwhile, Parliament passed the <strong>Thirty-ninth amendment</strong> to the Constitution which removed the authority of the Supreme Court to adjudicate petitions regarding elections of the President, Vice President, Prime Minister and Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Instead, a body constituted by Parliament would be vested with the power to resolve such election disputes. Section 4 of the Amendment Bill effectively thwarted any attempt to challenge the election of an incumbent, occupying any of the above offices in a court of law. This was clearly a pre-emptive action designed to benefit Smt. Indira Gandhi whose election was the object of the ongoing dispute.</p><p>Amendments were also made to the Representation of Peoples Acts of 1951 and 1974 and placed in the <strong>Ninth Schedule</strong> along with the Election Laws Amendment Act, 1975 in order to save the Prime Minister from embarassment if the apex court delivered an unfavourable verdict. The mala fide intention of the government was proved by the haste in which the <strong>Thirty-ninth amendment</strong> was passed. The bill was introduced on August 7, 1975 and passed by the Lok Sabha the same day. The Rajya Sabha (Upper House or House of Elders) passed it the next day and the President gave his assent two days later. The amendment was ratified by the state legislatures in special Saturday sessions. It was gazetted on August 10. When the Supreme Court opened the case for hearing the next day, the Attorney General asked the Court to throw out the case in the light of the new amendment.</p><p>Counsel for Raj Narain who was the political opponent challenging Mrs. Gandhi’s election argued that the amendment was against the basic structure of the Constitution as it affected the conduct of free and fair elections and the power of judicial review. Counsel also argued that Parliament was not competent to use its constituent power for validating an election that was declared void by the High Court.</p><p>Four out of five judges on the bench upheld the <strong>Thirty-ninth amendmen</strong>t, but only after striking downthat part which sought to curb the power of the judiciary to adjudicate in the current election dispute.[19] One judge, <strong>Beg, J</strong>. upheld the amendment in its entirety. Mrs. Gandhi’s election was declared validon the basis of the amended election laws. The judges grudgingly accepted Parliament’s power topass laws that have a retrospective effect.</p><p><strong>Basic Features of the Constitution according to the Election case verdict</strong></p><p>Again, each judge expressed views about what amounts to the basic structure of the Constitution:</p><p>According to<strong> Justice H.R. Khanna, democracy is a basic feature of the Constitution andincludes free and fair elections</strong>.</p><p><strong>Justice K.K. Thomas</strong> held that the <strong>power of judicial review is an essential feature</strong>.</p><p><strong>Justice Y.V. Chandrachud</strong> listed four basic features which he considered unamendable:</p><p>• sovereign democratic republic status</p><p>• equality of status and opportunity of an individual</p><p>• secularism and freedom of conscience and religion</p><p>• ‘government of laws and not of men’ i.e. the rule of law</p><p>According to <strong>Chief Justice A.N. Ray</strong>, the constituent power of Parliament was above the Constitution itself and therefore not bound by the principle of separation of powers. Parliament could therefore exclude laws relating election disputes from judicial review. He opined, strangely, that <strong>democracy was a basic feature but not free and fair elections</strong>. <strong>Ray, C.J. </strong>held that ordinary legislation was not within the scope of basic features.</p><p><strong>Justice K.K. Mathew</strong> agreed with <strong>Ray, C.J.</strong> that ordinary laws did not fall within the purview of basic structure. But he held that <strong>democracy was an essential feature and that election disputes must be decided on the basis of law and facts by the judiciary</strong>.</p><p><strong>Justice M.H. Beg</strong> disagreed with <strong>Ray, C.J.</strong> on the grounds that it would be unnecessary to have a Constitution if Parliament’s constituent power were said to be above it.[20] Judicial powers were vested in the Supreme Court and the High Courts and Parliament could not perform them. He contended that <strong>supremacy of the Constitution and separation of powers</strong> were basic features as understood by the majority in the Kesavananda Bharati case. <strong>Beg, J.</strong> emphasised<strong> that the doctrine of basic structure included within its scope ordinary legislation also</strong>.</p><p><strong>Despite the disagreement between the judges on what constituted the basic structure of the Constitution, the idea that the Constitution had a core content which was sacrosanct was upheld by the majority view.</strong></p><p><strong>The Kesavananda Review Bench</strong></p><p>Within three days of the decision on the Election case <strong>Ray, C.J.</strong> convened a thirteen judge bench toreview the Kesavanada verdict on the pretext of hearing a number of petitions relating to land ceiling laws which had been languishing in high courts. The petitions contended that the application of landceiling laws violated the basic structure of the Constitution. In effect the Review bench was to decidewhether or not the basic structure doctrine restricted Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution. The decision in the Bank Nationalisation case was also up for review.</p><p><strong>Meanwhile Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in a speech in Parliament, refused to accept thedogma of basic structure. </strong>[21]</p><p>It must be remembered that no specific petition seeking a review of the Kesavananda verdict filedbefore the apex court- a fact noted with much chagrin by several members of the bench. N.N.Palkhivala appearing for on behalf of a coal mining company eloquently argued against the move toreview the Kesavananda decision. Ultimately, <strong>Ray, C.J.</strong> dissolved the bench after two days ofhearings. Many people have suspected the government’s indirect involvement in this episode seekingto undo an unfavourable judicial precedent set by the Kesavananda decision. However no concerted efforts were made to pursue the case.</p><p>The declaration of a National Emergency in June 1975 and the consequent suspension offundamental freedoms, including the right to move courts against preventive detention, diverted theattention of the country from this issue.</p><p><strong>Sardar Swaran Singh Committee and the Forty-second amendment</strong></p><p>Soon after the declaration of National Emergency, the Congress party constituted a committee under the Chairmanship of Sardar Swaran Singh to study the question of amending the Constitution in the light of past experiences. Based on its recommendations, the government incorporated several changes to the Constitution including the <strong>Preamble</strong>, through the <strong>Forty-second amendment</strong> (passed in 1976 and came into effect on January 3, 1977). Among other things the amendment:</p><p>a) gave the <strong>Directive Principles of State Policy</strong> precedence over the <strong>Fundamental Rights</strong> contained in <strong>Article 14</strong> (<strong>right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws</strong>), <strong>Article 19</strong> (various freedoms like <strong>freedom of speech and expression, right to assemble peacefully, right to form associations and unions, right to move about and reside freely inany part of the country and the right to pursue any trade or profession</strong>) and <strong>Article 21</strong> (<strong>right to life and personal liberty</strong>). <strong>Article 31C </strong>was amended to prohibit any challenge to laws madeunder any of the <strong>Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>;[22]</p><p>b) laid down that amendments to the Constitution made in the past or those likely to be made infuture could not be questioned in any court on any ground;</p><p>c) removed all amendments to fundamental rights from the scope of judicial review and</p><p>d) removed all limits on Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution under Article 368.</p><p><strong>Basic structure doctrine reaffirmed- the Minerva Mills and Waman Rao cases</strong></p><p>Within less than two years of the restoration of Parliament’s amending powers to near absolute terms,the <strong>Forty-second amendment</strong> was challenged before the Supreme Court by the owners of MinervaMills (Bangalore) a sick industrial firm which was nationalised by the government in 1974.[23]</p><p>Mr. N.A. Palkhivala, renowned constitutional lawyer and counsel for the petitioners, chose not tochallenge the government’s action merely in terms of an infringement of the fundamental right toproperty. Instead, he framed the challenge in terms of Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution.</p><p>Mr. Palkhivala argued that Section 55 of the amendment[24] had placed unlimited amending power in the hands of Parliament. The attempt to immunise constitutional amendments against judicial review violated the doctrine of basic structure which had been recognised by the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharati and Indira Gandhi Election Cases. He further contended that the amended <strong>Article 31C</strong> was constitutionally bad as it violated the Preamble of the Constitution and thefundamental rights of citizens. It also took away the power of judicial review.</p><p><strong>Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud</strong>, delivering the majority judgement (4:1), upheld both contentions.The majority view upheld the power of judicial review of constitutional amendments. They maintained that clauses (4) and (5) of <strong>Article 368 </strong>conferred unlimited power on Parliament to amend the Constitution. They said that this deprived courts of the ability to question the amendment even if it damaged or destroyed the Constitution’s basic structure.</p><p><strong>The judges, who concurred with Chandrachud, C.J. ruled that a limited amending power itselfis a basic feature of the Constitution</strong>.</p><p><strong>Bhagwati, J.</strong> the dissenting judge also agreed with this view stating that no authority howsoever lofty, could claim to be the sole judge of its power and actions under the Constitution[25].</p><p>The majority held the amendment to <strong>Article 31C</strong> unconstitutional as it destroyed the <strong>harmony and balance between fundamental rights and directive principles which is an essential or basic feature of the Constitution</strong>.[26] The amendment to<strong> Article 31C </strong>remains a dead letter as it has notbeen repealed or deleted by Parliament. Nevertheless cases under it are decided as it existed prior tothe <strong>Forty-second amendment</strong>.</p><p>In another case relating to a similar dispute involving agricultural property the apex court, held that all constitutional amendments made after the date of the Kesavananda Bharati judgement were open to judicial review.[27] All laws placed in the <strong>Ninth Schedule</strong> after the date of the Kesavananda Bharatijudgement were also open to review in the courts. They can be challenged on the ground that theyare beyond Parliament’s constituent power or that they have damaged the basic structure of theConstitution. In essence, the Supreme Court struck a balance between its authority to interpret the Constitution and Parliament’s power to amend it.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>It may be said that the final word on the issue of the basic structure of the Constitution has not beenpronounced by the Supreme Court- a scenario that is unlikely to change in the near future. While theidea that there is such a thing as a basic structure to the Constitution is well established its contentscannot be completely determined with any measure of finality until a judgement of the Supreme Courtspells it out. Nevertheless <strong>the sovereign, democratic and secular character of the polity, rule oflaw, independence of the judiciary, fundamental rights of citizens etc. are some of theessential features of the Constitution that have appeared time and again in the apex court’s pronouncements</strong>. One certainty that emerged out of this tussle between Parliament and thejudiciary is that all laws and constitutional amendments are now subject to judicial review and lawsthat transgress the basic structure are likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court. In essenceParliament’s power to amend the Constitution is not absolute and the Supreme Court is the finalarbiter over and interpreter of all constitutional amendments.</p><p>[1] Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225: AIR 1973 SC 1461.2</p><p>[2] Originally, the Constitution guaranteed a citizen, the fundamental right to acquire hold and dispose of property underArticle 19f. Under Article 31 he could not be deprived of his property unless it was acquired by the State, under a lawthat determined the amount of compensation he ought to receive against such an acquisition. Property owned by anindividual or a firm could be acquired by the State only for public purposes and upon payment of compensationdetermined by the law. Article 31 has been modified six times — beginning with the First amendment in 1951 –progressively curtailing this fundamental right. Finally in 1978, Article 19f was omitted and Article 31 repealed by the Fortyfourthamendment. Instead Article 300A was introduced in Part XII making the right to property only a legal right. Thisprovision implies that the executive arm of the government (civil servants and the police) could not interfere with the citizen’sright to property. However, Parliament and state legislatures had the power to make laws affecting the citizens’ right toproperty.]</p><p>[3] Later on, laws relating to the nationalisation of certain sick industrial undertakings, the regulation of monopolies and restrictive trade practices, transactions in foreign exchange, abolition of bonded labour, ceiling on urban land holdings, the supply and distribution of essential commodities and reservation benefits provided for Scheduled Castes and Tribes in Tamil Nadu were added to the Ninth Schedule through various constitutional amendments.</p><p>[4] Article 13 (2) states- “The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.” The term Part refers to Part III ofthe Constitution which lists the fundamental rights of the citizen.</p><p>[5] Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><b>Accord and satisfaction</b> is a contract law concept about the purchase of the release from a debt obligation. It is one of the methods by which parties to a contract may terminate their agreement. The release is completed by the transfer of valuable consideration that must not be the actual performance of the obligation itself.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</sup> The accord is the agreement to discharge the obligation and the satisfaction is the legal “consideration” which binds the parties to the agreement. A valid accord does not discharge the prior contract; instead it suspends the right to enforce it in accordance with the terms of the accord contract, in which satisfaction, or performance of the contract will discharge both contracts (the original and the accord). If the creditor breaches the accord, then the debtor will be able to bring up the existence of the accord in order to enjoin any action against him.</p><p>Accord and satisfaction is normally a matter of state law and is usually defined as an agreement to discharge a claim in which the parties agree to give and accept different performance which is usually less than what is required or owed. Any claim based on an express or implied contract may be the subject matter of an accord and satisfaction. See our article on <strong>Contracts.</strong> Since an accord agreement is considered a new agreement substituting the old one, accord and satisfaction must have all essential elements of a contract.</p><p>Under most state law, a valid accord and satisfaction requires four elements as a minimum, usually,</p><p>(1) proper subject matter,</p><p>(2) competent parties,</p><p>(3) meeting of the minds of the parties and</p><p>(4) adequate consideration. See our <strong>contracts</strong> article for the usual additional requirements for a binding agreement in California.</p><p>An accord can be either an express agreement or may be implied, based on the circumstances surrounding the transaction. In <strong>litigation</strong>, since accord and satisfaction is an affirmative defense, the party raising accord and satisfaction must specifically plead it and prove it to the satisfaction of the Trier of Fact.</p><p><strong>The Basics:</strong></p><p>Usually, accord and satisfaction deals with a debtor’s offer of payment and a creditor’s acceptance of a lesser amount than the creditor originally claimed to be owed. It is a method of discharging a claim by settlement of the claim and performing the new agreement. The accord is the agreement and the satisfaction its execution or performance. <em>A new contract is substituted for an old contract thereby discharging an obligation or cause of action, which is settled, and must have all of the elements of a valid contract.</em></p><p>In an accord contract it is typical that the consideration supplied is less than bargained for in the original contract. Consideration is the value given in return for a promise. It has two elements:</p><p>(1) there must be a bargained-for exchange between the parties</p><p>(2) what is bargained for must have legal value.</p><p>Something legally sufficient must be given in exchange for a promise. It may be a return promise, such as not to file bankruptcy and/or provide security for the new obligation. If it is performance, that performance may be an act or forbearance. Whatever it is, it must be either legally detrimental to the promise or legally beneficial to the promisor. Legally detrimental is not always economically detrimental. A person can incur legal detriment by doing or promising to do something that he or she had no prior legal duty to do or refraining from or promising to refrain from doing something that he or she had no prior legal duty to refrain from doing.</p><p><strong>Accord and Satisfaction Versus Novation, Release and Payment</strong></p><p>The essential difference between an accord and a novation rests on the intention of the contracting parties. See <em>Paramount Aviation Corp. v. Agusta</em>, 178 F.3d 132 (3d Cir. N.J. 1999). An accord and satisfaction is a substitute contract for settlement of a debt by some alternative other than full payment. The consideration for an accord is often the resolution of a disputed claim. While in a <strong>novation</strong>, the new promise itself satisfies the preexisting claims, in an accord <em>it is the performance of the new promise</em> that satisfies the preexisting duty. The distinctive feature of an accord and satisfaction is that the obligee does not intend to discharge the existing claim merely upon the making of the accord. She or he can do so <em>only upon performance or satisfaction. If the satisfaction is not tendered, the obligee may sue under the original claim or for breach of the accord.</em> On the other hand, novation bars revival of the preexisting duty. Burden of proving the extinguishment of preexisting duty is upon the party asserting a novation.</p><p>If the parties may intend that a new agreement, though only executory, will immediately discharge the existing obligation, such an agreement is called a <strong>substituted agreement</strong>. In situations where, “…the full performance of the revised contract terms is necessary to extinguish or discharge claims arising under an old contract, the revised contract is called an executory accord and performance is called a satisfaction, while in cases where mutual promises in a revised contract are held by themselves to discharge all claims arising under the earlier contract, the revised contract is called a substituted contract. <em>Community Builders v. Indian Motorcycle Assocs</em>., 44 Mass. App. Ct. 537 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998).</p><p>Payment is the discharge of a pecuniary obligation by the debtor by delivering a specific sum of money or the equivalent of a specific sum. The delivery can be actual or constructive and is made for the purpose of extinguishing an obligation. Payment requires delivery by the debtor and acceptance by the creditor, both with common purpose.<em> Parnell v. Sherman</em>, 899 S.W.2d 900 (Mo. Ct. App. S.D. 1995)</p><p>In opposition to <strong>payment</strong> or novation, an accord and satisfaction is generally defined as an agreement to discharge a debt or claim by some performance other than that which was originally due. Accord and satisfaction is contractual in nature, and hence the joint intent of the parties is necessary. Thus, a transaction will constitute an accord and satisfaction of a claim only where both parties both intend it. Absent such intent, a claim for a specific sum of money cannot be satisfied by partial payment. When a payment of less than what is claimed is offered and accepted, it will not constitute an accord and satisfaction of the entire claim unless it can be demonstrated that the creditor intended to accept it as full satisfaction.</p><p>According to California Civil Code § 1521, an accord is an agreement to accept, in extinction of an obligation, something different from or less than that to which the person agreeing to accept is entitled. Cal Civ Code § 1522 states that since the parties to an accord are bound to actually execute it, it does not extinguish the obligation <em>until it is fully executed</em>.</p><p>California Civil Code § 1523 defines satisfaction as acceptance, by the creditor, of the consideration of an accord. Satisfaction extinguishes the obligation. Moreover, Cal Civ Code § 1524 explains that part performance of an obligation extinguishes the obligation, if performed either before or after a breach thereof, but only where <em>expressly accepted by the creditor in writing, in satisfaction, or rendered in pursuance of an agreement in writing, though without any new consideration.</em></p><p><u>“Payment in Full” on the check:</u></p><p>According to Cal Civ Code § 1526, where a claim is disputed or unliquidated and a check or draft is tendered by the debtor in settlement thereof in full discharge of the claim, and the words “payment in full” or similar words are notated on the check or draft, the acceptance of the check or draft does <em>not </em>constitute an accord and satisfaction <em>if the creditor protests against accepting the tender in full payment by striking out or deleting that notation, or if the acceptance of the check or draft was inadvertent or without knowledge of the notation.</em></p><p>However, the acceptance of a check or draft constitutes an accord and satisfaction, if a check or draft is tendered pursuant to a composition or extension agreement between a debtor and its creditors, all creditors of the same class are accorded similar treatment, and the creditor receives the check or draft with knowledge of the restriction.</p><p>In the absence of such intent, the partial payment will operate as a discharge of only the amount paid, and the creditor will be entitled to maintain an action to recover the balance of his claim. To determine the intent of the parties, it is necessary to examine the language of the order of satisfaction and release in light of the circumstances existing at the time of the transaction.</p><p><u>Release versus Accord and Satisfaction:</u></p><p>An accord and satisfaction is distinguishable from <strong>release</strong>. A release is a abandonment of a right, which may be given gratuitously (for free) or for inadequate consideration, while an accord and satisfaction is the discharge of a debt or claim by the acceptance of some payment which is agreed to constitute full satisfaction<em> Holman v. Simborg</em>, 152 Ill. App. 3d 453, 456 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 1987). Thus, consideration is not a required element for a release but is for accord and satisfaction.</p><p>An accord and satisfaction has the same effect as that of a release in its impact <em>on third persons</em>. Since there can be but a single satisfaction for an injury or wrong, an accord and satisfaction made by one of two or more joint <strong>tort </strong>feasors will operate to discharge the others. However, where a payment made by one joint tort feasor is not intended to constitute satisfaction in full, it will not result in a discharge of the others, although it will operate as a partial satisfaction to be credited to any recovery against the remaining tort feasors.</p><p><strong>Off Sets and Counterclaims</strong></p><p>Controversy can arise as to settlement of claim on the basis of accord and satisfaction where a counterclaim or set-off is claimed as a part payment of the liquidated and undisputed debt. An initially liquidated claim becomes unliquidated when, by reason of a counterclaim or setoff, the actual amount due on the balance has been put in doubt between the parties. Under such circumstances, an accord and satisfaction may result from the payment of a lesser sum than the creditor’s claim, even a sum not in excess of the balance concededly due. Thus, a liquidated claim due a creditor is rendered unliquidated, “…when the debtor in good faith asserts a disputed counter-claim or set-off, and in such a case an accord and satisfaction may result from the payment by the debtor of an amount less than the creditor’s claim and no greater than the amount which the debtor concedes to be due. In <em>H.L. “Brownie” Choate, Inc. v. Southland Drilling Co., Inc</em>., 441 S.W.2d 672 (Tex. Civ. App. San Antonio 1969), plaintiff creditor, who was the service provider to the defendant debtor caused damage to defendant’s drilling rig. In accordance with their past practice, defendant recovered the damage amount by deducting it from the amount it owed to plaintiff for services rendered. Plaintiff filed suit to recover the deducted amount. The court held that, “…when the amount due was in dispute, and the debtor tendered a check for less than the amount claimed by the creditor while expressing his intention that the check was offered in full settlement, the retention and cashing of the check by the creditor was regarded as an acceptance of the offer, and such action on the part of the creditor operated as a full satisfaction.” The court found that plaintiff’s acceptance of a lesser amount constituted an accord and satisfaction of the debt. A majority of jurisdictions follow this view although there is authority to the contrary<em>. See B. Mifflin Hood Co. v. Lichter</em>, 106 F. Supp. 220, 231 (D. Tenn. 1950). (A counter or additional claim in dispute does not render the principal obligation unliquidated where such principal obligation is itself not in dispute. An accord and satisfaction in such cases would not be applicable.) The law of your own particular state will have to be reviewed by competent counsel to determine what would apply.<strong>UCC and Accord and Satisfaction</strong></p><p>See our article on the <strong>UCC </strong>before reading further.</p><p>According to the Uniform Commercial Code, U.C.C. § 3-311, if a person against whom a claim is asserted proves that:</p><ul><li>that person in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim;</li><li>the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute; and</li><li>the claimant obtained payment of the instrument</li></ul><p>then under U.C.C. § 3-311(b), unless other law applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a <u>conspicuous</u> statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.</p><p>However, a claim is not discharged if either:</p><ul><li>the claimant, if an organization, proves that within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office, or place, and the instrument or accompanying communication was not received by that designated person, office, or place; or</li><li>the claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that within 90 days after payment of the instrument, the claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against whom the claim is asserted.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, a claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Accords and satisfactions occur both in business and in daily life far more often that usually realized. Every time you accept less than owed, even informally, you have adopted an accord and satisfaction if and when the new obligation is performed. When economic times are difficult, such resolutions of dispute are common. What is often mistaken for accord and satisfaction, (releases and settlements and novations) require quite different criteria and documentation and that is where most people get into trouble.</p><p>And, of course, the omnipresent “payment in full” written on partial payment checks are a constant source of dispute as creditors and debtors argue as to whether an accord and satisfaction resulted. The law of the particular state rules such issues (often the UCC when between merchants) and the wise creditor or debtor will learn the particular law before issuing or cashing such a check.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> “The binding force of International Treaty is on account of the fundamental principle known as Pacta Sunt Servanda”. Explain.</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Introduction:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sanctity of contract is one of the most fundamental principles of law <b>(I)</b>. However, the interaction between the sanctity of contract and changed circumstances has to be investigated. This paper will therefore focus hardship clauses which provide for a change in circumstances <b>(II)</b>. It will then briefly consider to what extent arbitrators – amiable compositors – may grant relief because of changed circumstances <b>(III)</b>. It thereafter will examine whether arbitrators who are not amiable compositors and who cannot apply a hardship clause, are entitled to grant relief because of changed circumstances <b>(IV)</b>. Finally, the remedies available in a case of changed circumstances will be analyzed <b>(V)</b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">His sanctity of contract is, understandably, a paramount feature of the law of contract. <em><b>Pacta sunt servanda:</b></em>the contract has to be respected. As a matter of principle, parties must adhere to the terms of their contract. This explains, for instance, why economic hardship does not affect international sales under the Vienna Convention on International Sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arbitrators have to apply the terms of the contract which parties have agreed upon. Arbitration treaty law, arbitration statutes as well as arbitration rules confirm that the arbitrator has to respect the contract terms. Arbitrators have frequently confirmed the sanctity of contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For disputes with a state or state entity as a party, arbitrators often rely an <b>pacta sunt servanda</b> . This may not surprise as contracts concluded with such parties are generally submitted to rules of international law, which includes the principle of <em><b>pacta sunt servanda</b></em>. In the <em><b>Sapphire v. National lranian Oil Company</b></em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""></a> award, for instance, the arbitrators expressly stated: “It is a fundamental principle of law, which is constantly being proclaimed by international courts, that contractual undertakings must be respected. The rule <em>pacta sunt servanda</em> is the basis of every contractual relationship.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Contractual Provisions:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Parties, who are aware that the context of the contract may change, can agree on a hardship clause in their contract. Some of these clauses provide the contract will terminate when a specified change in circumstances has occurred. Other clauses, such as indexation clauses or price revision clauses provide the contract terms will be automatically changed if such circumstances arise. Finally, some clauses, adaptation clauses, merely order the parties to adapt the contract terms to the new circumstances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some authors have argued that the widespread use of hardship clauses in long-term contracts has created a custom: the hardship clause must be implied in the contract even if it was not expressly included by parties. However, the fact that parties sometimes include a hardship clause in the contract may prove that no general customary principle exists. Moreover, there is such a variety in these hardship clauses with regard to their scope, application and remedy, that it is difficult to base a customary principle on them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the mere presence of a hardship clause should not in itself exclude the application of the general law on changed circumstances. It would be too cumbersome if parties were obliged to negotiate and draft hardship clauses covering all possible events which may affect performance. Consequently, the general law on changed circumstances remains applicable to all changes not covered by a hardship clause. This principle has been recognized by arbitrators from the Arbitration Court of the Japan Shipping Exchange, who stated<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The relation between this <b>Article (renegotiation clause)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><b>[3]</b></a></b> and the principle of change in situation is such that the present article does not exclude the said principle, but provides for either one of the parties to request the other for consultation to amend the price, even in the instances where the principle of the change in situation does not need to be applied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Enforcement of International Law:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Rebus sic stantibus </i>is a principle of international treaty law. The 1969 Vienna Convention and Law of Treaties, <b>Article 62,</b> states:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties, may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from the treaty unless: <b>(a)</b> the existence of those circumstances constituted an essential basis of the consent of the parties to be bound by the treaty; and <b>(b)</b> the effect of the change is radically to transform the extent of the obligations still to be performed under the treaty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The wording of Article 62 demonstrates the exceptional character of <i>rebus sic <b>stantibus</b></i>. It is subordinate to the more general principle of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>, as set out in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The change in circumstance has to be fundamental. It has to jeopardize the survival of the State. Simple loss of economic gain or currency reforms is insufficient. As the International Court stated in the <b><i>Fisheries Jurisdiction </i></b>case, the changes must be vital: they have to “imperil the existence or vital development of one the parties”. Moreover, the change in circumstances has to be unforeseeable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, although parties have often invoked rebus sic stantibus before international tribunals, such parties have never been granted relief on these grounds. The International Court of Justice or other tribunals have always refused to apply <b><i>rebus sic stantibus</i></b> to a treaty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. Enforcement of National Law:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In <i>English law</i>, the doctrine of “frustration of purpose” excuses performance when the circumstances have changed so much that the performance required by the contract is radically different from that which was initially undertaken by the parties. However, more recently, English judges have been generally reluctant to find that a particular contract has been frustrated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In <b><i>German law</i>,</b> the theory of <b><i>Wegfall der Geschäftsgrundlage</i></b> (disappearance of the Basis of the transaction) covers the effect of changed circumstances on the contract. Paragraph 242 of the German Civil Code (BGB)<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> requires that the contract be performed in good faith. However, when the circumstances have unforeseeably and substantially changed, the foundations of the transaction have been destroyed and the parties are no longer bound to their original contractual commitments. Requesting the original performance of the contract would constitute bad faith. The <b><i>Wegfall der Geschäftsgrundlage</i></b> was quite easily applied in the years of galloping inflation after both World Wars. However, it has been less easily accepted with regard to commercial contracts concluded between businessmen. At present Wegfall der Geschäftsgrundlage is applied rather restrictively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. Recognition:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes the contract obliges parties to renegotiate when circumstances have changed. If these negotiations are successful, the contractual relationship is rearranged.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, what happens when these negotiations fail? Most renegotiation clauses are silent on this point. Arbitral practice is very scarce. For instance, arbitrators of the Arbitration Court of the Japan Shipping Exchange refused to terminate the contract in such event, similarly, an I.C.C<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>. Award, rendered in 1974, indicated that a clause to renegotiate does not give a party the right to terminate the contract when negotiations fail. Termination would only be possible if the other party unreasonably refused to accept the proposal to adapt the contract. Eventually, arbitrators would have to decide whether such refusal was unjustified and constituted a breach of contract giving rise to its termination. Arbitrators thus decided that a Libyan general contractor committed a breach of contract when he failed to participate in the renegotiations on price increases with his Italian subcontractor in spite of his contractual commitment to do so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>6. Contract Adaptation:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under certain legal systems, such as public international law or English law, a judge or an arbitrator does not have the power to adapt contract terms to changed circumstances or to substitute new terms more suitable for the changed situation. However, under some legal systems, such as the German, the Dutch or the Japanese, the judges or arbitrators are empowered to adjust contracts to take into account the changed circumstances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, some renegotiation clauses state that arbitrators have to adapt the contract to changed circumstances in the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement on contract amendment. Such clauses sometimes provide rather vague standards that the arbitrator has to apply: <b>he should have “due regard for the interests of the other party”; he should respect “<i>l’esprit de collaboration et de répartition équitable des résultats</i>“; he should do whatever is possible “<i>pour rétablir la position relative des parties</i>“.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><b>[6]</b></a></b> Such clauses sometimes specify the binding force of the arbitrator’s decision: it may either be finally binding or subject to both parties’ approval (In the latter case, the contract is terminated when both parties do not agree with the arbitrator’s proposal).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>7. Arbitration Practice:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Contract allocates risks among the parties. When the contract is drafted in precise terms but does not provide for a remedy when circumstances are changed, it may be assumed that the party, who is supposed to assume this risk, has taken such risk. As stated by an I.C.C. arbitrator:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a general rule, one should be particularly reluctant to accept it when there is no gap or lacuna in the contract and when the intent of the parties has been clearly expressed . . . . Caution is especially called for, moreover, in international transactions where it is generally much less likely that the parties have been unaware of the risk of a remote contingency or unable to formulate it precisely.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The decision on whether or not performance has become so onerous that relief should be granted depends on the risks assumed by each of the parties. In this context arbitrators sometimes distinguish between speculative and non-speculative contracts. When parties did not enter into a contract with speculative intentions, relief for changed circumstances should be more easily granted. The arbitrators in <i>S.E.E.E. v. Yugoslavia</i>, for instance, stated: “As regards an international contract concluded without speculative intention, it ought to be admitted, as it has been judged, that the devaluation guarantee was meant by the parties, save express convention.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, I.C.C. arbitrators have based their relief for changed circumstances on the non-speculative nature of the contract: “<i>C’est une règle de la Lex Mercatoria que les prestations restent équilibrées sur le plan financier et hier ce principe reviendrait à faire du contrat commercial un contrat aléatoire fondé sur la spéculation ou le hasard.</i>“.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arbitrators of the Japan Shipping Exchange similarly stated: “In contracts such as the present one, of a commercial base, where the cost may be set arbitrarily and which has a speculative nature to a degree, it is not possible to decide that there existed a situation to which so-called change in situation principle could be applied.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fundamental changes in the political conditions as a consequence of the Revolution in Iran, the different attitude of the new Government and the new foreign policy especially towards the United States which had considerable support in large sections of the people, the drastically changed significance of highly sensitive military contracts as the present one, especially those to which the United States companies were parties, are all factors that brought about such a change of circumstances as to give the Respondent (the Iranian government)<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> a right to terminate the contract when the Ministry of Defense decided not to go on.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>8. Conclusion:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It may be questioned whether the third person, who adapts the contract, is really an “arbitrator”, in the legal sense of this term. Indeed, an arbitrator is supposed to solve legal disputes, i.e., disputes over existing rights and duties. The person who adapts contract terms, merely rearranges the contractual relationship an behalf of the parties. In the strict sense of the term, adaptation is not arbitration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In many long term-contracts, time is of the essence and delays in performance are sanctioned heavily by substantial penalty clauses. When a change in circumstances affects contract performance, the contract will often not be suspended or terminated. The party continues performance but notifies the other side that compensation for additional performances or for unjust enrichment will be claimed after the work is finished. Compensation thus has been granted in arbitration to an Italian subcontractor who had continued to perform for a Lybian general contractor in spite of more difficult performance<a name="Footnote_Inline_772facf6ca9b472453039811"></a>&lt;href=”#Footnote-772facf6ca9b47245303981194fcfcea”&gt;91 . It has been doubted whether the person who adjusts contract terms, still can be considered to be an arbitrator. However, delicate questions as to the nature of contract adjustment are avoided when arbitrators do not adapt the contract terms, but grant a posteriori compensation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>9.

When parties did not enter into a contract with speculative intentions, relief for changed circumstances should be more easily granted. The arbitrators in <i>S.E.E.E. v. Yugoslavia</i>, for instance, stated: “As regards an international contract concluded without speculative intention, it ought to be admitted, as it has been judged, that the devaluation guarantee was meant by the parties, save express convention.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, I.C.C. arbitrators have based their relief for changed circumstances on the non-speculative nature of the contract: “<i>C’est une règle de la Lex Mercatoria que les prestations restent équilibrées sur le plan financier et hier ce principe reviendrait à faire du contrat commercial un contrat aléatoire fondé sur la spéculation ou le hasard.</i>“.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arbitrators of the Japan Shipping Exchange similarly stated: “In contracts such as the present one, of a commercial base, where the cost may be set arbitrarily and which has a speculative nature to a degree, it is not possible to decide that there existed a situation to which so-called change in situation principle could be applied.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fundamental changes in the political conditions as a consequence of the Revolution in Iran, the different attitude of the new Government and the new foreign policy especially towards the United States which had considerable support in large sections of the people, the drastically changed significance of highly sensitive military contracts as the present one, especially those to which the United States companies were parties, are all factors that brought about such a change of circumstances as to give the Respondent (the Iranian government) a right to terminate the contract when the Ministry of Defense decided not to go on.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>8. Conclusion:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It may be questioned whether the third person, who adapts the contract, is really an “arbitrator”, in the legal sense of this term. Indeed, an arbitrator is supposed to solve legal disputes, i.e., disputes over existing rights and duties. The person, who adapts contract terms, merely rearranges the contractual relationship and behalf of the parties. In the strict sense of the term, adaptation is not arbitration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In many long term-contracts, time is of the essence and delays in performance are sanctioned heavily by substantial penalty clauses. When a change in circumstances affects contract performance, the contract will often not be suspended or terminated. The party continues performance but notifies the other side that compensation for additional performances or for unjust enrichment will be claimed after the work is finished. Compensation thus has been granted in arbitration to an Italian subcontractor who had continued to perform for a Lybian general contractor in spite of more difficult performance<a name="Footnote_Inline_772facf6ca9b472453039811"></a>&lt;href=”#Footnote-772facf6ca9b47245303981194fcfcea”&gt;91 . It has been doubted whether the person who adjusts contract terms, still can be considered to be an arbitrator. However, delicate questions as to the nature of contract adjustment are avoided when arbitrators do not adapt the contract terms, but grant a posteriori compensation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>9.

9138	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE CAUSES OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Crime. Why some people commit crimes and while others do not has always interested me. Every hour a crime is committed in the United States and people have been committing crimes as early as the Bible days. Later in the seventeenth century European colonists in North America considered crime and sin the same thing. They believed evil spirits possessed those who did not conform to social norms or follow rules. The act of committing a crime is not relegated to any particular race, sex, or age. Persons as old as 80 have been convicted of murder: James von Brun, who shot the security guard at the Washington DC Holocaust Museum in June 2009 will likely be convicted; he was 88 at the time of the murder, to children as young as 11: On January 14, 2000, Nathaniel Abraham, 11, was the youngest child convicted of murder.</p><p>Many feel criminal activity and choosing to commit a crime is a case of nature vs. nurture. All of us combine good and bad traits, and while certain circumstances may cause individuals to go beyond the bounds of normal behavior, there is no basis to assert that these people are “totally evil.” We think we can spot lunacy, that a maniac with uncontrollable urges to kill will be unable to contain himself. In the street, it is the mentally ill we avoid, sidestepping the disheveled, unshaven man who rants on with himself It is evident that those guilty of the most heinous violent crimes tend to fit an otherwise “average” description. There are many reports where the neighbors of a mass murderer were shocked to find that the “nice guy who lived next door” had committed such despicable acts.</p><p>The factors causing criminal activities are varied and hard to pinpoint. Some cases may be due to the financial status of the person, while others may be due to the mental health or social outlook of the person. Crimes like theft are committed for gain and excitement, while many</p><p>violent crimes are committed by people who consider themselves powerless. But, how do some people decide to commit a crime? Do they think about the benefits and the risks? Why do some people commit crimes regardless of the consequences? Why do others never commit a crime, no matter how desperate their circumstances?</p><p>I am fascinated with the television show, Bait Car, it forces you to ask these questions and want to put them in perspective. The police department goes into an area that has a high vehicle theft crime rate, stages an argument and it seems as if the person is so distracted that they leave their car; door open and keys in the ignition. Then they, wait and watch to see if anyone takes the “bait” and drives off with the car. Every single time, without fail, a person or persons get in the car and take off. Sometimes, you can see that they wrestle with “good and evil”; they go to the car, sit in it, look through it, and some even leave it. Only to return, and inevitably steal the vehicle. Some are forewarned, by either a bystander or a friend, but they always choose the wrong path and knowingly take possession of something that they know is not theirs. While in the car, cameras catch the euphoria of the criminals thinking that they’ve gotten away with it, if they have a co-conspirator, they practice what to say when caught. When they are caught, excuses range from, “the owner of the car asked me to bring it to them, I was going to turn it in, I don’t know why I did, and I didn’t steal it”. For me, this show asks the question, “Why would you get into a car that simply is not yours”? Perhaps the answer to this is that some crimes are simply opportunistic and for the simple purpose of greed and stupidity. Some people decide to commit a crime and carefully plan everything in advance to increase gain and decrease risk. These people are making choices about their behavior; some even consider a life of crime better than a regular job-believing crime brings in greater rewards, admiration, and excitement-at</p><p>least until they are caught. Others get an adrenaline rush when successfully carrying out a dangerous crime. Others commit crimes on impulse, out of rage or fear.</p><p>What causes a person to turn to a life of crime? Is it the fault of the parents; is it a societal or medical mishap? What kind of upbringing breeds a child that would be violent enough at the age of fifteen to commit an act of armed robbery that results in murder?  “It was an urge. … A strong urge, and the longer I let it go the stronger it got, to where I was taking risks to go out and kill people – risks that normally, according to my little rules of operation, I wouldn’t take because they could lead to arrest.”-Edmund Kemper. Why does Kemper have this strong urge, and why does it have such a hold on him? If we experienced this urge, would we be able to resist? Is the need to commit a crime genetic, hormonal, biological, or cultural conditioning? Do people who kill have no control over their desire? We all experience rage and inappropriate sexual instincts, yet we somehow know how to keep our inner demons locked up.</p><p>Are we born evil? Born to be a criminal? Or does how and/or where we were raised determine that outcome? That same question was asked back in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when the role of genetics in crime was widely accepted (Joseph, 2001). Prominent researchers believed that genes were fully responsible for criminal activity and that criminals could be identified by their physiological features. This period was marked with inhumane treatment and the belief that genes were the sole reason behind criminal behavior. By the late twentieth century the general public did not believe that criminal acts were mental, they believed in free will and called for more prisons and longer bouts of incarceration. Researchers</p><p>in the twenty-first century, however, continued to look at psychological stress as a driving force behind some crimes.</p><p>In 1986, psychologist Robert Hare identified a connection between certain brain activity and antisocial behavior. He found that criminals experienced less brain reaction to dangerous situations than most people. Such a brain function, he believed, could lead to greater risk-taking in life, with some criminals not fearing punishment as much as others.</p><p>Neurochemicals are responsible for the activation of behavioral patterns and tendencies in specific areas of the brain (Elliot, 2000). As seen in the Brunner et al. study, there have been attempts to determine the role of neurochemicals in influencing criminal or antisocial behavior. Included in the list of neurochemicals already cited by researchers are monoamine oxidase (MOA), epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that has been shown to be related to antisocial behavior. Specifically, low MAO activity results in disinhibition which can lead to impulsivity and aggression. MAO is associated with many of the neurochemicals that already have a link to antisocial or criminal behavior. Norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are metabolized by both MAOA and MAOB (Elliot, 2000).</p><p>Serotonin is a neurochemical that plays an important role in the personality traits of depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2005). It is also involved with brain development and a disorder in this system could lead to an increase in aggressiveness and impulsivity (Morley &amp; Hall, 2003). In addition, children who suffer from conduct disorder, have</p><p>also been shown to have low blood serotonin (Elliot, 2000). There is a great deal of evidence that shows serotonin is related to aggression, which can be further associated with antisocial or criminal behavior. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is associated with pleasure and is also one of the neurotransmitters that is chiefly associated with aggression. Activation of both affective (emotionally driven) and predatory aggression is accomplished by dopamine (Elliot, 2000).</p><p>Personality traits and disorders have recently become essential in the diagnosis of individuals with antisocial or criminal behavior. Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD) is characterized by argumentativeness, noncompliance, and irritability, which can be found in early childhood. When a child with ODD grows older, the characteristics of their behavior also change and more often for the worse. They start to lie and steal, engage in vandalism, substance abuse, and show aggression towards peers (Holmes et al., 2001). Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and the inability to keep attention focused on one thing. Children diagnosed with ADHD have the inability to analyze and anticipate consequences or learn from their past behavior.</p><p>Conduct Disorder is characterized with an individual’s violation of societal rules and norms. This disorder can only be diagnosed when an individual is over the age of eighteen and at which point an individual shows persistent disregard for the rights of others (Morley &amp; Hall, 2003). It is of great importance that these early childhood disorders are correctly diagnosed and effectively treated to prevent future problems. Antisocial behavior between the ages of nine and fifteen can be correlated strongly with impulsivity and that aggression in early childhood can</p><p>predict antisocial acts and delinquency. One statistic shows that between seventy and ninety percent of violent offenders had been highly aggressive as young children (Holmes et al., 2001). These personality traits have, in some research, been shown to be heritable.</p><p>Searching for the origins of antisocial personality disorders and their influence over crime has led to studies of twins and adopted children. Identical twins have the exact same genetic makeup. Researchers found that identical twins were twice as likely to have similar criminal behavior as fraternal twins who have similar but not identical genes, just like any two siblings.</p><p>One of the most fundamental studies influencing scientific opinions of nature vs. nurture would be a study done comparing identical vs. fraternal twins. (Christiansen, 1977). In this study, twin pairs were examined for the concordance of criminal behavior for both twins. This is a study of particular interest because both sets of twins were raised in the same environment but in one case, the case of the identical twin sets, the siblings are genetically identical where as in the other case, the case of the fraternal twin sets, the siblings are merely genetically similar. The identical twin pairs were found to have a 50% concordance (in one out of two cases both twins exhibited criminal behavior) where in the fraternal cases there was only 21% concordance. This illustrates a strong correlation of genetics and criminal disposition but it also indicates the relative importance of environmental factors as well; environmental factors influence criminal behavior, which explains why there is not a 1:1 correlation of genetic disposition and criminal behavior.</p><p>Other research indicated that adopted children had greater similarities of crime rates to their biological parents than to their adoptive parents. A study was done using identical twins</p><p>that were adopted by two different families and raised apart from each other. It was observed that adopted children are as aggressive as their adoptive parents rather than their biological parents. The results from both studies indicate that environment and genetic disposition are equally as responsible in shaping human behavior. (Mednick, Gabrielli, and Hutchings, 1984)</p><p>The frontal lobe of the brain is the functioning area for behavior in human beings, and there are beliefs in the scientific community that damage to the frontal lobe can cause significant behavioral problems for individuals. In fact, there are findings that prefrontal cortical deficits and abnormalities in the temporal lobe are high within the incarcerated population</p><p>Recent studies show that our criminal justice system is the new home for individuals with psychological problems. Although this may seem like a solution, it is creates a dilemma for society. Do we have the treatment and rehabilitation in prison to prepare inmates for life outside? Once we label these individuals as criminals it creates a stigma for those who may suffer from psychological problems. Certain psychological problems have been shown to be heritable and if given the right circumstances, individuals with those genes could find themselves engaging in criminal activity. If a tragedy occurs and a friend or loved one’s life is ended purposely, or a child has been hurt or traumatized, people can lose control and act out of anger. And because of their reactions, they too, have now become the criminal.</p><p>Not everyone who is incarcerated has criminal tendencies. Many have made irrational choices out of anger or desperation or no thought of the consequences of an action. There are many factors that can create a criminal mind, but there are also many factors that cause people to</p><p>make irrational choices. It goes back to when we were taught “cause and effect”.</p><p>We often speculate but there is no definite answer to why some people become criminals. The brain is a mysterious organ, that is constantly being studied.</p></div></div>

By the aforesaid judgment the High Court Division made the Rule absolute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. The writ petition was filed questioning legality of the order dated March 27, 1997 dismissing the petitioner from the service of Thakurgaon Palli Biddyut Samity, Jagannathpur, Thakurgaon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. Facts, in short are that Respondent No.l was appointed by the Rural Electrification Board (REB) on February 10, 1991 as an officer of the Palli Biddyut Samity (the Samity)(General Service) for one year as probationer. After completion of period of probation he was made permanent officer of the Samity and later on was posted as Assistant General Manager (General Service) of Thakurgaon Palli Biddyut Samity. While serving as Assistant General Manager he was made accused in a cases filed by his wife under Section 10 (2) of the Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan (Bishesh Bidhan) Ain.1995 and was arrested in connection with that case on July 7, 1996. The authority put him under suspension by the order dated July 14, 1996. The Court by the judgment and order February 27, 1997 convicted the Respondent No. 1 in the case registered under Nari-o-Shishu Nirjatan (Baishesh Bidhan) Ain, 1995 and sentenced him to suffer imprisonment for life. On appeal, Criminal Appeal No. 411 of 1997. The High Court Division acquitted the Respondent No. 1 by the judgment and order January 11, 1998. Being convicted in the Nari-o-shishu Nirjatan case the authority dismissed the Respondent No.l on March 27. 1997 from the service under Rule 46 (2) of the Thakurgaon Palli Biddyut Samity Sevice Rule. The Respondent No. 1 on being acquitted by the judgment of the High Court Division filed application on February 12, 1998 for setting aside the order of dismissal and to restore into his post with all benefits and privileges. In spite of repeated remainders to the authority to set aside his order of dismissal and to restore himto his post the respondent No. 1 did not receive any reply from the authority. In the background of the aforesaid facts the Respondent No. 1 served notice demanding justice by way of setting aside the order of dismissal and for restoring him to his post with all benefits and privileges but did not receive any reply. ‘</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. The High Court Division upon observing .In the instant case the admitted position is that the petitioner was an Assistant General Manager (General Service) of Thakurgaon Palli Bidyut Samity. The impugned dismissal order was signed by the Acting General Magager of Thakurgaon Palli Bidyut Samity. According to the rule quoted above the General Manager, Thakurgaon Palli Bidyut Samity was required to obtain prior approval both of the Samity Board and the Rural Electrification Board.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. The Respondents have failed to show any eivdence that such approval was obtained from Thajurgaon Palli Bidyut Samity and the Rural Electrification Board. In that view of the matter we hold that the impugned dismissal order was passed without lawful authority. There is no record before us nor it is the case of the respondents that any domestic enquiry was held against the petitioner on allegation made in paragraph 1 of the dismissal order. No enquiry or proceeding having been started against the petitioner on those grounds or any other grounds, the dismissal order on those grounds without giving the petitioner an opportunity to defend himself or to be heard is illegal and without lawful authority. Therefore the impugned order as a whole passed without lawful authority. The petitioner having been acquitted of the charge made against him he under section 3 of the Public servants (Dismissal On conviction) Ordinance. 1985 is entitled to be reinstated to his original post held at the time of suspension and (dismissal order that is Assistant General Manager (General Service) of Thakurgaon Palli Bidut Samity The inordinate delay in considering his appeal was good enough reason for the petitioner to be aggrieved and to file this writ petition. Further is was pointed out that although an alternative forum is available if an order is passed without jurisdiction then that is corum-non-judice and the aggrieved person may come for relief under the writ jurisdiction although there is an alternative forum available for redress” made the Rule absolute with a direction to the writ Respondents to reinstate the Respondent No.l herein hi his service with all benefits from 14.7.1996.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. Leave was granted to consider the question of non maintainability of the writ petition for impleading chairman, Rural Electrification Board instead of the Rural Electrification Board.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. The learned Counsel appearing for the appellants submits that High Court Division was in serious error in granting the relief prayed for in the writ petition since the writ petitioner did not impaled the Rural Electrification Board which is the authority in the matter of employment and dismissal as well as reinstatement of an employee like the writ petitioner and others. The learned Counsel also submits that the Rural Electrification Board (the Board) is a statutory body established under the Rural electrification Board Ordinance, 1977 and as per section 3(2) of the said Ordinance the writ petition was required to be filed impleading the Board, but writ petitioner filed without impleading the Board and as such writ petition was not maintainable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. The submissions so made appears to be not correct. It is seen from the papers on record that while the writ Respondent Nos.l and 2 in their affidavit-in-opposition raised the question of maintainability of the writ petition on the ground of non-impleaiding the Rural Electrification Board, the writ petitioner filed an application for adding the Rural Electrification Board and the Thakurgaon Palli Bidyut Samity as Respondent Nos. 6 and 7 in the writ petition . The High Court Division by the order of January 27, 2000 impleaded the Rural Electrification Board and Thakurgaon Palli Bidyut Samity as writ Respondent Nos.6 and 7 and made further direction to serve a copy of the Rule that was issued on February 7,1999 on the added Respondents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. In response to the Rule so served on the Respondent Nos. 6 i.e. Rural Electrification Board, the Board entered appearance and filed an affidavit-in-opposition. In the afore state of the matter it is seen that the contention of the appellants that writ petition was filed without misleading the Rural Electrification Board and consequent thereupon the writ petition being not maintainable the High Court Division was in error in making the Rule absolute appears to be of no merit. As we have already mentioned hereinbefore the appellants (Respondent Nos.l and 2 in the writ petition ) in their affidavit-inopposition having had raised question of maintainability of the writ petition on the ground of non impleading Rural Electrification Board, the writ petitioner filed application before the High Court Division for impleading the Rural Electrification Board and Thakurgaon Ralli Bidyut Samity as Respondent and the High Court Division by the order January 27, 2000 impleaded them as Respondent Nos. 6 and 7 respectively and the respondent No.6 Rural Electrification Board filed affidavit-in-opposition. Thereafter, writ petition was heard on March 9, 2000 and by the judgment of March 12, 2000 the High Court Division made the Rule absolute in presence of the Rural Electrification Board with a direction to reinstate the writ petitioner, Respondent No. 1 herein, in his post which he was holding on July 14, 1996 with all benefits. In the afore state of the matter the contention making which leave was obtained by the appellants is of no merit. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs at all stages.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ed</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Source: I ADC (2004), 192</strong></p></div></div>

9144	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The Chief Prosecutor Vs. Abdul Quader Molla</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;">written by her titled ‘Shahid Kabi Meherun-nesa’ published in June 2011, in narrating the event, she has not incriminated the accused with the alleged killing. P.W.4 even in her earlier statement made to IO has not stated anything incriminating the accused.</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><b>232.  </b>It is further argued by the learned defence counsel that the hearsay version as to complicity of the accused does not carry value. Besides, P.W.10 another hearsay witness has stated that he learnt that non-Bangalees of the Mirpur locality killed Meherunnesa. Therefore, there has been no credible evidence to connect the accused with the perpetration of the crime alleged in charge no. 2.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>233. </b>Conversely, the learned prosecutor has submitted that P.W.2 and P.W.4 are quite reliable witnesses and their hearsay evidence coupled with other proved relevant facts and circumstances carries reasonable probative value. Even an ‘individual’, apart from member of ‘auxiliary force’ , may be brought to justice under the Act of 1973 and he can be held guilty even if he is found to have committed offence specified in section 3(2) of the Act of 1973. Context of war of liberation in 1971, extent of atrocities committed in furtherance of ‘operation search light’ and the pattern of criminal acts forming attack directed against civilians constituting the offence of murder itself  proves that the offence was not isolated crime but those were committed in violation of customary international law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>234. </b>The Tribunal notes that hearsay evidence, under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 is admissible and we do have jurisdiction to act on it if it is found to have reasonable probative value. It is found from evidence that immediately after the ‘operation search light’ on 25 March, 1971 the perpetrators had launched horrific attack on 27 Match 1971 to Meherunnesa and her family inmates and it is not disputed that they were brutally slaughtered at their own house.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>235. </b>The defence has not been able to offer even a hint, by cross-examining the prosec-ution witnesses, that the murder was not a part of planned or systematic attack and it was an isolated crime. Therefore, the context, facts and circumstances revealed inevitably have proved the elements to constitute the alleged offence of murder as crime against humanity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>236. </b>From the hearsay evidence of P.W.2 Syed Shahidul Huq Mama it has been proved that on 27 March accused Abdul Quader Molla, Hasib Hashmi, Abbas Chairman, Aktar Goonda, Hakka Goonda, Nehal and their accomplices slaughtered poetess Meherunnesa, her brothers and mother. In cross-examination it has been simply denied but could not be shaken. P.W.2 had learnt the event of horrific killing of Meherunnesa and her family inmates from mass people. Defence could not dislodge it. Besides, in view of frightened situation prevailing at that time it was not natural and probable for particular Bengali resident of the locality to witness such atrocious event of killing. Rather learning the incident from mass people was natural and probable. Thus, hearsay evidence of P.W.2, if viewed together with the facts relevant to the role and continuous culpable association of the accused with the local Bihari perpetrators, inspires reasonable degree of credence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>237. </b>Next, hearsay evidence of P.W.4 goes to show that she had sensed that an attack would have been directed to her and Meherunnesa for the reason that they were actively involved with the ‘action committee’ organized to resist the disgrace caused to Bengali residents of Mirpur locality by the Biharis. This fact remains unshaken.  Next, it has been already proved that local Bihari Aktar Goonda, Nehal goonda, Hakka goonda and Bihari hooligans were accomplices of the accused Abdul Quader Molla who led the gang to the crime site. We have also found from evidence of P.W.4 that accused himself did not enter into the house of Meherunnesa.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>238. </b>We are convinced to pen our unambiguous view that leading the gang to the crime site is a significant act to establish culpable link of accused to the actual commission of the crime.  In the case in hand we have found that accused Abdul Quader Molla led the gang of perpetrators to the house of the unarmed civilian victims, although the evidence does not show that the accused himself had directly participated to the actual commission of the crime alleged. As a result hearsay evidence of P.W.4 together with the relevant facts as to close culpable association of accused with the gang of Bihari perpetrators inevitably goes to adequately indicate his conduct as a link to the perpetration of the brutal killing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>239. </b>Murder as a crime against humanity under section 3(2) of the Act does not require the Prosecution to establish that the accused personally committed the killing. Personal commission is only one of the modes of responsibilities identified under section 4(1) of the Act.  The accused shall be considered to have incurred criminal responsibility for the commission of murder as crime against humanity if it is established that his act in any way proves his complicity to the commission of such crime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>240. </b>It is the ‘attack’, not the acts of the accused, which must be directed against the target population, and the accused need only know that his acts are part thereof. The context prevailing at the relevant time (27 March 1971) together with the pattern and extent of attack signifies that intent of launching attack was to cause wrongs and criminal acts directing Meherunnesa and her family inmates, the unarmed civilians.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>241. </b>The learned defence counsel has argued that P.W.4 is not a credible witness as her testimony made before the Tribunal is contradictory to the account she made in the book (Exhibit-B) titled “ Shahid Kabi Meherunnesa’ written by her.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>242. </b>P.W.4 Kazi Rosy admitted that she did not mention anybody’s name in her book titled ‘Shahid Kabi Meherunnesa’ as there had been no judicial mechanism of prosecuting the perpetrators. She further explained that for the reason of fear she could not name any perpetrator responsible for the killing of Meherunnesa and her family. Since a judicial forum has been set up she is now testifying implicating accused Abdul Quader Molla.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>243. </b>First, the oral evidence of a witness may not be identical to the account given in a prior statement. A witness may be asked different questions at trial than he/she was asked in prior interviews and that he/she may remember additional details when specifically asked in court. Second, presumably a predictable fear might have prevented P.W.4 in mentioning name of perpetrators in her book. Undeniably, for the reason of lack of a favourable situation and well-built consensus the issue of prosecuting and trying the perpetrators of dreadful crimes committed during the war of liberation in 1971 remained halted for several decades. Third, in the intervening time the pro-Pakistan political organisation has been able to revitalize its position in the independent Bangladesh, without any substantial impediment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>244. </b>For the rationales as stated above, a pro-liberation individual like P.W.4 usually is not likely to come forward with all details in narrating the account in the book written by her prior to making testimony before the Tribunal, for the reason of apprehended fear and risk. Explanation offered for the differences by the P.W.4 seems to be attuned to circumstances prevailing till setting up of a judicial mechanism under the Act of 1973. On contrary, defence could not suggest or establish any motive whatsoever for testifying such version which differs from her earlier account. Therefore, mere lack of specificity of perpetrator(s) or any omission in the book written by her earlier does not turn down her sworn testimony made before the Tribunal branding it to be a glaring contradiction, provided if it inspires credence in light of other relevant facts and circumstance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>245. </b>The act of leading the gang of actual perpetrators is indeed an act forming part of the attack that substantially contributed and provided ‘moral support’ and ‘encouragement’ to the actual commission of the crime. Merely for the reason that the accused had no physical participation to the perpetration he cannot be relieved from liability as his act of leading the gang of course provided substantial moral support and encouragement to the principals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>246. </b>Complicity encompasses ‘culpable association’ with the principals, and providing ‘moral support’, ‘encouragement’ to them. An accused can be considered to have participated in the commission of a crime if he is found to be ‘concerned with the killing’. By the act of leading the gang of perpetrators the accused is thus found to have provided moral support and encouragement to the principals to the actual commission of the crime. It is to be noted that a single or relatively limited number of acts on part of the accused would qualify as a crime against humanity, unless those acts may be said to be isolated. Leading the gang of perpetrators to the crime site was of course not an isolated act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>247. </b>It has been observed by the Appeal Chamber (ICTY) in the case of<b><i> Deronjic</i></b><b>,</b> [July 20, 2005, para. 109] that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“All other conditions being met, a single or limited number of acts on the accused’s part would qualify as a crime against humanity, unless those acts may be said to be isolated or random.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>248. </b>Also in the case of<b><i> Kupreskic, </i></b>the<b><i> </i></b>Trial Chamber of ICTY [January 14, 2000, para. 550] has observed that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“In certain circumstances, a single act has comprised a crime against humanity when it occurred within the necessary context.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>249. </b>Therefore, it is now settled that even a single act on part of accused constitutes part of attack for committing the offence of murder as ‘crime against humanity’. But the acts or conducts of accused must have been shown to have ‘link’ with the commission of the crime. ‘Leading the gang of perpetrators’ to the crime site is such a conduct that establishes a sufficient ‘link’ of the accused Abdul Quader Molla with the actual commission of the offence alleged.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>250. </b>Merely for the reason of absence of direct evidence the hearsay evidence, as discussed above, as to the complicity and conduct of the accused Abdul Quader Molla to the accomplishment of actual commission of the offence alleged cannot be brushed aside, particularly when it gets strength from some proved pertinent relevant facts and circumstances as to his patent culpable association with the gang of principal perpetrators.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>251. </b>The intent or mental element of complicity implies in general that, at the moment he acted, the accomplice knew of the assistance he was providing in the commission of the principal offence. In other words, the accomplice must have acted knowingly. Leading the gang of perpetrators in launching an attack directed against Meherunnesa and her family inmates who were unarmed civilians itself indicates that the accused acted so knowingly and he was aware of the consequence of his act. Attack directed to Mehernnusa and her family inmates on 27 March 1971, in view of context of the war of liberation in 1971 and circumstances prevailing particularly in Dhaka, in furtherance of ‘operation search light’ on 25 March, 1971, was of course launched with knowledge and with criminal intent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>252. </b>It may be lawfully inferred that the accused knew or had reason to know that the principals were acting with intent to commit the offence of murder.

They at the relevant time used to reside in Mirpur locality of Dhaka city. Both of them are hearsay witnesses as to the actual event of killing, as they had no opportunity to see the event. They have also testified facts relevant to the event of killing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Discussion of Evidence </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>255. </b><b>P.W.5 Khandoker Abul Ahsan </b>is the survived son of Khandoker Abu Taleb. At the relevant time he was student of class IX of Mirpur Shah Ali Academy High School. His father was an eminent journalist and lawyer and had been residing in the house situated in plot 13 road no. 2 block-B sections 10 of Mirpur locality.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>256. </b><b>P.W.5 Khandoker Abul Ahsan</b> stated that on 23 March 1971, while Syed Qayum (P.W.10), Head Master of Mirpur Bangla School had been staying at his house at Mirpur 10, block-C, at 02:30-03:00 am 3-4 persons entering inside the house by breaking door attacked said Qayum and started him scolding for hoisting the flag of ‘Swadhin Bangla’ at his school and then they stabbed him by repeated dagger blow causing bleeding injuries. Qayum attempted to flee there from but fell down on the street and then one Bangalee people somehow brought him to their (P.W.5) house wherefrom after giving him first aid, on the following morning, he was brought to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for having treatment and then his (P.W.5) father rushed to Bangabandhu and informed him of the incident. His father (victim) became mentally upset seeing the condition of Qayum and then on 24 March they came to the place of his ‘<i>phupu’</i> at Shantinagar’ area leaving his father at Mirpur house. His father was, at the relevant time, a part time feature editor of the ‘Daily Paigam’ and also was associated with a law firm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>257. </b>P.W.5 further stated that on 25 March, on getting information of demolishing the Ittefaque office his father (victim) rushed there for seeing condition of his colleagues but on arriving there he found some dead bodies there. On 29 March, his father(victim) was about to go to their Mirpur residence for bringing his car and money there from but on his way to Mirpur he had occasion to meet one non Bengali  Abdul Halim, the chief accountant of the ‘Daily Ittefaque’ who in the name of taking him to Mirpur by his own car brought him(victim) to the accused Abdul Quader Molla and then his father was slaughtered by the accused  to death by repeated dagger blows at Mirpur 10 ‘Jallad Khana’  and at that time Aktar Goonda and some non Bangalee were with Abdul Quader Molla(accused) .</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>258. </b>In cross-examination, P.W.5 stated that he cane to know from Advocate Khalil of BNR (Law Firm) that one non Bengali  Abdul Halim, the chief accountant of the ‘Daily Ittefaque’ brought his father by his car  and Abdul Halim handed his (P.W.5) father over to Abdul Quader Molla and his accomplices at Mirpur. He also re-affirmed, on cross-examination, that he heard from their non-Bangalee driver Nizam that Abdul Halim handed his father over to Abdul Qauder Molla and his accomplices and his father was slaughtered at ‘Jallad Khana’. At the revenant time Abdul Qauder Molla was a resident of Duari para, Mirpur and most people knew it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>259. </b>If we consider the narration made by P.W.5 in examination-in-chief and that he has re-affirmed on cross-examination together it is amply found that his hearsay testimony as to the fact of taking his farther the victim to Mirpur by Abdul Halim by his car and handing him over to Abdul Qauder Molla and his accomplices inspires credence. The sources of knowledge about the taking away of his father to Mirpur and handing him over to the accused and his accomplices were Advocate Khalil and their (P.W.5) non Bengali driver Nizam and both of them are not alive now.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>260. </b>P.W.5 stated that he himself did not witness the horrific incidents happened in 1971 and it was not possible for any Bangalee excepting a very few to witness it. This version reflects the horrifying reality and situation prevailing at the relevant time and as such availability of direct witness to prove the fact of actual commission of killing Khandaker Abu Taleb naturally may not be possible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>261. </b>P.W.5 further stated that subsequently he came to know from Nizam, their (P.W.5) non-Bangalee driver that the people who embraced defeat in 1970 national election i.e. Aktar Goonda, Abdullah and some other Biharis, on order of Abdul Quader Molla, committed extensive killings in the locality of Muslim Bazar, Shialbari, Jallad Khana. This version remains totally unshaken and rather it appears to have been re-affirmed on cross-examination.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>262. </b><b>P.W.10 Syed Abdul Qayum</b> a resident of Mirpur and friend of victim Khandoker Abu Taleb stated that Faruk Khan came to meet him in the month of June 1971 when he had been at his native village Nasirnagar after he had left Dhaka Medical College on 27 March 1971 wherein he was undergoing treatment for injuries he sustained resulting from the attack launched directing him in the night of 23 March 1971.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>263. </b>From Faruk Khan he (P.W.10) came to know that local Aktar Goonda, Biharis and Abdul Quader Molla had killed Taleb Saheb at Mirpur 10 ‘Jallad Khana’. He (P.W.10) returned home on 3 January 1972 after the independence and afterwards, he learnt from  Nizam the non Bangalee driver of Abu Taleb(victim) that Abu Taleb was coming his home at Mirpur with non-Bengali accountant Halim but Halim handed him (Abu Taleb) over to the Biharis who slaughtered him at ‘Jallad khana’. In cross-examination, defence simply denied this version instead of shaking its credibility.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Evaluation of Evidence and Finding</b></p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><b>264. </b> Slaughtering Kahndaker Abu Taleb to death at Mirpur ‘Jallad Khana’ is not disputed. From evidence of P.W.5 it has been proved that on 29 March 1971 victim was coming to his Mirpur home with non-Bengali accountant Abdul Halim by his (Halim) car. The fact of handing the victim over to accused Abdul Qauder Molla is denied by the defence. But the involvement of Aktar Goonda and local Bihari in slaughtering the victim to death remains also unshaken.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>265. </b>The Defence attacked the credibility of hearsay evidence of P.W.5 mainly on the ground of inconsistencies between his narration in court and that made to the investigation officer. The learned defence counsel has argued that  P.W.12 the Investigation officer has stated in his cross-examination P.W.5 did not state to him that non Bengali  Abdul Halim, the chief accountant of the ‘Daily Ittefaque’ brought his father by his car  and Abdul Halim handed his (P.W.5) father over to Abdul Quader Molla and his accomplices at Mirpur.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>266. </b>The learned defence counsel has argued that both the P.W.5 and P.10 are hearsay witnesses who have been examined by the prosecution in support of charge no.3. P.W.5 claims to have heard from their non-Bangalee driver Nizam that non-Bangalee Abdul Halim handed his father over to the accused Abdul Quader Molla. But he did not state it earlier to the IO. Besides, the book <b>(Exhibit-B-Page 24, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph)</b> speaks that said Abdul Halim handed the victim to non-Bangalees. Thus the defence does not dispute the fact of taking the victim by Abdul Halim by his car to Miprur and then he was slaughtered by Biharis. But the hearsay evidence of P.W.5 as to the fact of handing the victim over to accused is inconsistent with his earlier statement made to IO. Thus, the accused cannot be linked or said to have acted in any manner to the perpetration of killing Khandoker Abu Taleb.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>267. </b>The learned defence counsel went on to argue further that  hearsay evidence of P.W.10  has stated that he learnt the event alleged first from one Faruk Khan during 1971 and then in January 1972 from Bihari  Nizam , the driver of victim Khandoker Abu Taleb. Faruk Khan told P.W.10 that Biharis, Aktar goonda and Abdul Quader Molla slaughtered Khandoker Abu Taleb to death at Muslim Bazar. But Driver Nizam disclosed to P.W.10 that Bihari Aktar goonda and other Bihari people killed Khandoker Abu Taleb which is consistent with the  narration made in the book Exhibit-B. Which one is true? Inconsistent hearsay evidence thus cannot be relied upon for finding the accused guilty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>268. </b>The Tribunal notes that P.W.12 the IO has stated that P.W.5 stated to him that he learnt from Khalil that Halim brought his (P.W.5) father (victim) to Mirpur by his (Halim) car. Therefore, this cannot be a contradiction or subsequent embellishment, particularly when the P.W.5, in reply to question elicited to him by the defence stated that he came to know from Advocate Khalil of BNR (Law Firm) that one non Bengali Abdul Halim, the chief accountant of the ‘Daily Ittefaque’ brought his father by his car and Abdul Halim handed his (P.W.5) father over to Abdul Quader Molla and his accomplices at Mirpur.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>269. </b>It would be only an omission presumably due to his not being questioned on the point [Abdul Halim handed his (P.W.5) father over to Abdul Quader Molla and his accomplices at Mirpur] by the IO, during investigation. Therefore, that cannot be of any benefit to the defence to suggest that the witness is now making intelligent improvements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>270. </b>In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in   the   depositions   of witnesses   due   to   normal   errors   of   observation, namely,   errors   of   memory   due   to   lapse   of   time   or   due   to   mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence. Thus, exaggerations <i>per se</i> do not render the evidence brittle. However,   minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments   or   improvements   on   trivial   matters which   do   not   affect   the   core   of   the   prosecution   case,   should   not   be made a ground on which the evidence can be rejected in its entirety.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>271. </b>The fact of coming the victim on the date at his Mirpur home with Abdul Halim by his car, handing him over to the Bihari perpetrators and then slaughtering him to death at Mirpur ‘Jallad Khana’ remain quite unshaken. The hearsay evidence of P.W.5 and P.W.10 seems to be credible and relevant and thus carries probative value.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>272. </b>Having appraisal of evidence of P.W.2, we have already found as to who the accomplices of accused Abdul Quader Molla were and his culpable association with them, particularly during the early part of war of liberation 1971. It is proved that the local Biharis namely Aktar Goonda, Nehal, Hakka goonda, Abbas Chairman, Hasib Hashmi were close accomplices of accused Abdul Qauder Molla in all antagonistic activities during pre-25 March time and also during the early part of war of liberation in perpetrating atrocities in Mirpur locality. The event of killing as listed in charge no.3 took place on 29 March 1971 i.e within four days of the ‘operation search light’ on 25 March 1971. We have got a clear depiction as to role, conduct and culpable association of the accused with the local Bihari hooligans that he had shown on 26 March 1971, as described by P.W.2. It is significantly relevant to lend assurance as to complicity of accused with the commission of the event of killing Khandoker Abu Taleb, an unarmed civilian.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>273. </b>The above proved facts together with the evidence of P.W.5 that Abdul Qauder Molla, Aktar Goonda and some non-Bengali were at the Miprur ‘Jallad khana’ when his father (Khandoker Abu Taleb) was slaughtered to death sufficiently proves the complicity of the accused Abdul Quader Molla with  the event of killing.  Therefore, we are convinced that the hearsay evidence of P.W.5 carries probative value as it is found reliable and relevant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>274. </b>Complicity encompasses assistance, encouragement, or moral supports which are mostly possible to provide if culpable association is maintained with the principals. Amongst 10% of Bangalee residents of Mirpur locality why accused Abdul Quader Molla opted to be associated for almost all the time with the local Bihari hooligans namely Aktar goonda, Nehal, Hakka Goonda, Hasib Hashmi who were extremely antagonistic to Bangalees of the locality, instead of saving fellow Bangalee residents?  Of course such association of the accused fueled the principals targeting the local pro-liberation Bangalee civilians in furtherance of ‘operation search light on 25 March 1971.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>275. </b>Cumulative effect of evidence and relevant facts and circumstances may have a decisive role in determining the culpability of the accused.  Circumstantial evidence is not considered to be of less probative value than direct evidence. The act of culpable association of the accused with the principals and the evidence as discussed above inevitably proves that the accused Abdul Quader Molla was involved with the commission of the alleged brutal killing. Considering the context and pattern of attack we are satisfied that the aforementioned killing formed part of a systematic or organised attack against the civilian population. The victim of the alleged killing was a member of pro-liberation civilian population. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that the aforementioned killing constitutes the offence of murder as a crime against humanity committed in violation of customary international law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>276. </b>We have already observed that actual physical participation when the crime is committed is not necessary and an accused can be considered to have participated ‘in the commission of a crime’ if he is found to be ‘concerned’ with the killing. Since the testimony of P.W.5 as to the fact of bringing the victim to Mirpur by Non-Bangalee accountant Abdul Halim by his car who handed him over to accused Abdul Quader Molla and at the time of slaughtering the victim accused was present at the crime site carries sufficient probative value the accused is considered to have acted so  intending to provide moral support and encouragement to the principals with whom he maintained continuous and culpable association accused Abdul Quader Molla incurs criminal liability for ‘complicity’ in commission of the murder of Khandoker Abu Taleb constituting the offence of crimes against humanity as specified in section 3(2)(a)(h) of the Act of 1973 which are punishable under section 20(2)  read with section 3(1) of the said Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Adjudication of Charge No.4 </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>[Ghatar Char and Bhawal Khan Bari killing]</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>277. </b><b>Summary Charge No.04:</b> During the period of War of Liberation ,on 25.11.1971 at about 07:30 am to 11:00 am the accused Abdul Quader Molla one of  leaders of Islami Chatra Sangha and as well as prominent member of Al-Badar, being accompanied by his 60-70 accomplices belonging to Razaker Bahini went to the village Khanbari and Ghatar Char (Shaheed Nagar)  under police station Keraniganj, Dhaka and in concert with his accomplices, raided the house of  Mozaffar Ahmed Khan and apprehended two unarmed freedom fighters named Osman Gani and Golam Mostafa there from and thereafter,  they were brutally murdered by charging bayonet  in broad day light.

P.W.1 and P.W.8 are hearsay witnesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>279. </b>The commission of the crime causing mass killing as narrated in charge no.4 is however not disputed. Defence has argued that the accused was not involved with it in any manner as the prosecution has been totally failed to prove involvement of the accused either as a physical perpetrator or as an abettor or as an accomplice of the principals. Hearsay evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.8 does not carry any reliability and as such recognised standard of proof does not allow depending on it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Discussion of Evidence </b></p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><b>280. </b> <b>P.W.1 Mozaffar Ahmed Khan</b> is a valiant freedom fighter who is from the crime village. It is found from evidence of P.W.1 that he knew the accused even since 1969 as he while attending meetings at ‘Madhur canteen’; DhakaUniversity saw the accused who was a leader of Islami Chatra Sangha. But P.W.1 does not claim to have witnessed the accused committing any criminal act. However, he had learnt the incident from Abdul Mazid Palwan (P.W.7). P.W.1 testified the commission of the event and killing of two freedom fighters Osman Gani and Golam Mostafa. But he however has not claimed to have witnessed the involvement of accused with the commission of the massacre.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>281. </b>P.W.1 however, has stated that prior to the alleged event he saw the accused standing in front of Mohammadpur Physical Training center, Dhaka having rifle in hand while he was coming back home from Mohammadpur.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>282. </b>P.W.1 Mozaffar Ahmed Khan lodged a complaint against accused bringing accusation relating the alleged event of killing in the court of Magistrate, Keraniganj. It is admitted. P.W.12 the IO has admitted that for the purpose of initiating investigation he obtained information from the complaint petition after the same was sent to the Investigation Agency through the office of the Registrar, ICT.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>283. </b>P.W.7 Abdul Mazid Palwan claims to have witnessed the event of massacre and the accused Abdul Quader Molla accompanying the gang of perpetrators to the crime site. P.W.8 claims to have heard that accused was with the gang with a rifle in hand who killed her father.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>284. </b>We are to determine, was P.W.7 able to observe what he alleges to have witnessed? Does the witness have any reason to say something different from what he actually observed? It is not necessarily due to the bad faith of the witness. It may be that the witness was really present and that he saw the commission of the crime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>285. </b>Let us see what the P.W.7 has stated. P.W.7 Abdul Mazid Palwan, a resident of crime site Ghatar Char at the relevant time,  stated that on 25 November 1971 in the early morning on hearing gun firing from northern end of the village he started approaching towards that end and found, remaining in hiding into a bush, Pakistani army, Abdul Qauder Molla and Biharis killing civilians. Abdul Quader Molla also fired by the rifle in his hand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>286. </b>P.W.7 in the next breath has stated that after the gang of perpetrators had left the crime site at about 11:00 am he learnt that the person accompanying the gang wearing Pajama-Panjabi was Abdul Qauder Molla and some Bangalee having their body covered by ‘<i>borkha’ </i>also accompanied the Pakistani army to the crime site.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>287. </b>P.W.8 Nurjahan is the wife of victim Nabi Hossain. At the relevant time she was 13 years old and used to reside at village Ghatar Char with her husband and she was pregnant at that time.  On 25 November 1971 in the early morning on hearing heavy gun firing they remained in hiding under a cot. After gun firing had ceased her husband came out of house to see what was happening and he saw the Pakistani army coming toward their house and then her husband moved to his uncle Mozammel’s house and then she again heard gun firing. Afterwards her mother-in-law came and told that her husband was no more and with this she started running to the house of Mozammel and found her husband lying dead there. She also found there some Pakistani army and a Bangalee person of black complexion and dwarf height who by a rifle in his hand asked her to leave the place and with this being frightened she went inside the dwelling hut.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>288. </b>The event of attack causing murder of husband of P.W.8 remains undisputed and defence could not shake it by cross-examining her.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>289. </b>P.W.8 stated that afterwards she , at about 10:30-11:00 am found her husband dead receiving bullet injury on forehead and chest.P.W.8 also stated that she learnt that in conjunction of the event about 50-60 civilians of Ghatar Char were killed. She heard from her father-in-law Luddu Mia and Mazid Palwan (P.W.7) of their village that a person named Qauder Molla belonging to Jamat had killed her husband.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Evaluation and Findings</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>290. </b>The learned defence counsel argued that  two victims of Ghatarchar event(as listed in charge no.4)  were freedom fighters who were not ‘civilians’ as they were volunteer corps and a party to conflict and hostility and thus the acts resulted in their death cannot be considered as ‘directing any civilian population’.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>291. </b>We cannot agree with the argument that merely for the reason that two out of numerous civilian victims were freedom fighters the crimes committed resulting death of civilians cannot be characterized as the offence of crimes against humanity. The Tribunal notes that specific situation of the victim at the moment of the crimes committed, rather than his status, at the time of event of the attack is to be considered. In the case of <b><i>Prosecutor v. Blaskic</i></b> para 214 it has been observed that</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“a civilian is everyone who is no longer an active combatant in the ‘specific situation’ at the time of the commission of the crime. Besides, broad definition of civilian adopted by the adhoc tribunals implies that the character of a predominantly civilian population is not altered by the presence of certain non-civilians in their midst”</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>292. </b>The ICTY and ICTR Statutes as well as jurisprudence state that the attack must be committed against <i>any </i>civilian population. This qualification has been interpreted to mean that the inclusion of non-civilians (military forces or those who have previously borne arms in a conflict) does not necessarily deprive the population of its civilian character. <b>[</b><i> <b>Tadic</b> </i>Trial Judgment, <i> </i>638; <b><i>Blaskic</i></b><i> </i>Trial Judgment,  209] .</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>293. </b>However, the targeted population must remain predominantly civilian in nature. But according to ICTR and ICTY jurisprudence, it is the situation of the victim at the time of the attack, and not the victim’s status, that should be the focus of the inquiry. Therefore, we are of view that the attack as narrated in charge no.4 was directed against civilian population that resulted in numerous deaths of civilians and thus the offence of such murder is characterized as crimes against humanity as specified in section 3(2) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>294. </b>The learned defence counsel also advanced his submission on definition of ‘murder’ by citing decision dated 26 July 2010 in the case No.001/18-07-2007/ECCC/TC of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia(ECCC), para, 331 [ Page- 156 of the Final Argument Pack submitted by the defence)]. Paragraph 331 of the judgment reads as below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“Murder, a well established crime under customary international law, requires the death of the victim resulting from an unlawful act or omission by the perpetrator. The conduct of the perpetrator must have contributed substantially to the death of the victims.” </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>295. </b>The fact of death of victims resulting from the attack launched in the locality of Ghatarchar and Bhawal Kahnbari is not disputed. The accused is alleged to have accompanied the principals in perpetrating the crimes (as listed in charge no.4). Of course the burden is on prosecution to establish first the presence of accused at the crime site and then his conduct or act that provided encouragement or moral support to the principals in committing the offence of crimes against humanity. Only after proving the presence of accused at the crime site, it is to be adjudicated whether the death of victims was a result of act or conduct of the accused and it must be the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence and circumstances. ‘Awareness’ as to consequence of act or conduct on part of the accused is sufficient to prove contribution of accused to the commission of the murder of victims.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>296. </b>However, now let us evaluate what the P.W.1, P.W.7 and P.W.8 have testified in relation to charge no.4 . Of them P.W.7 and P.W.8 claim to have witnessed the event that allegedly continued from early morning to about 11:00 am of 25 November 1971. The attack was allegedly launched directing the civilian population of village ‘Ghatarchar’ and ‘Khan Bhawalbari’ under keraniganj police station district Dhaka. A gang of Pakistani army, Biharis and Al-Badar allegedly perpetrated the crime while accused Abdul Quader Molla is also alleged to have accompanied them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>297. </b>First, we find that P.W.7 has made conflicting version as to the fact that accused accompanied the Pakistani army having rifle in his hand. Because, once he claims to have witnessed the accused at the crime site having rifle in hand and then claims to have learnt that a person named Abdul Quader Molla accompanied the gang after they had left the crime site. Which one is true version?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>298. </b>P.W.7 has not even disclosed the source of his knowledge as to presence of accused at the crime site. Next, according to him, he on hearing frequent gun firing from the end of northern part of village started approaching to that end and then he saw the accused Abdul Quader Molla with the Pakistani army. This version does not seem to be natural. Because, normal human prudence suggests that, particularly in circumstances prevailing through out the country, it was not natural for a Bangalee civilian to come forward to a place from which direction the perpetrators were moving with frequent gun firing. Rather in such a horrific situation non combatant civilians were supposed to escape. But P.W.7 claims that he rather moved forward to see what was happening. It is not believable as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>299. </b>Next, P.W.7 denied that he did not state what he has narrated here in Tribunal incriminating the accused with event alleged. But it appears that the I.O P.W.12 has stated that P.W.7 did not state all these to him implicating the accused, during investigation. Earlier statement made to IO is not evidence, true. But it is used to contradict what the witness deposes in court. Thus, it appears that there has been a fatal omission in earlier statement made to IO as to pertinent fact relating to culpability of the accused with the alleged event of attack causing mass killing of unarmed civilians which is a ‘glaring contradiction’ in evidence made before the Tribunal by P.W.7 on material particular which has created serious doubt as to credibility and truthfulness of his testimony.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>300. </b>This being the situation, naturally the hearsay evidence as to the fact of learning the event by P.W.1 from Abdul Mazid Palwan (P.W.7) loses weight and thus does not inspire any amount of credence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>301. </b>Admittedly P.W.8 does not claim that she knew accused Abdul Qauder Molla even since prior to the alleged event. Her version goes to show that she learnt from P.W.7 that a person named Qauder Molla had killed her husband. But already we have found that P.W.7 Abdul Mazid Palwan has made seriously contradictory testimony as to seeing the accused at the crime site accompanying the principals carrying rifle in hand. His evidence has been rather found to be subsequent embellishment which is a glaring contradiction on material particular. Thus, the claim that P.W.7 learnt about the complicity of accused from P.W.8 does not carry any value and it adds no corroboration to what has been testified by P.W.7.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>302. </b>Next,  the version as made by P.W.8 that she also found, at the place where her husband was killed, some army men and a Bangalee of black complexion and dwarf height who by a rifle in his hand asked her to leave the place  does not prove that the said person was nobody but accused Abdul Qauder Molla. Therefore, identification of accused on dock 40/41 years after she had seen the said ‘Bangalee person’ at the crime site  cannot be relied upon at all as it is not even possible to keep one’s face memorized particularly for a traumatized wife of victim.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>303. </b>Drawing attention to the above version defence suggested that she did not state it to the IO. P.W.8 denied it. But the IO (P.W.12), while contradicting P.W.8’s evidence made before the Tribunal, has stated that P.W.8 did not state it to him during investigation. That is to say, there has been crucial omission in her earlier statement on material particular. Indeed such omission in her earlier statement turns her testimony made here in Tribunal as subsequent embellishment which is a glaring contradiction that makes testimony of P.W.8 significantly unbelievable and perverted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>304. </b>Like all elements of a crime, the identification of the Accused must be proved by the Prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. In assessing identification evidence, it is to be taken into account a number of relevant factors, including: the circumstances in which each witness claimed to have observed the accused; the length of the observation; the familiarity of the witness with the Accused prior to the identification; and the description given by the witness of his or her identification of the accused. But as we see, the evidence does not inspire us to believe that the P.W.7 and P.W.8 were familiar as to identity of the accused even since prior to the alleged event. None of these two witnesses claim so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>305. </b>In view of above discussion and reasons the Tribunal notes unanimously that it has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused Abdul Quader Molla accompanied the Pakistani perpetrators to the crime site having rifle in hand and that the person whom P.W.8 claims to have seen at the crime site was none but the accused. It is not plausible too that P.W.8 had learnt from P.W.7 that accused Abdul Qauder Molla accompanied the principals to the crime site to the accomplishment of the offence of mass killing. Because. Testimony of P.W.7, in this regard, has been found to be disgustingly conflicting and contradictory inspiring no credence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>306. </b>Mere fact that P.W.1 saw the accused standing in front of Physical Training center, Dhaka having rifle in hand, on one day prior to the alleged event,  does not connect the accused with the commission of the event of massacre as listed in charge no.4. Although form this relevant fact it can be validly inferred that during the war of liberation the accused had complicity with the Pakistani occupation army as an armed member of Al-Badar.  Therefore, we are persuaded to note that the commission of the event of mass killing by launching attack directing the civilians as crimes against humanity on the date time and in the manner causing deaths of numerous civilians has been proved. Besides, commission of crimes alleged is not disputed. But for the reasons as stated above we are not convinced to arrive at decision that the guilt of accused has been proved. Prosecution has failed to prove participation or complicity or act on part of the accused to the commission of the offence of crimes against humanity by adducing lawful and credible evidence. As a result accused Abdul Quader Molla is not found to have incurred criminal liability for the commission of offence of mass killing as crimes against humanity as listed in charge no.4.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Adjudication of Charge No.05  </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>[Alubdi Mass Killing]</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>307. </b><b>Summary Charge No.05:</b> During the period of War of Liberation ,on 24.4.1971 at about 04:30 am, the members of  the accused Abdul Quader Molla one of  leaders of Islami Chatra Sangha and as well as prominent member of Al-Badar or member of group of individuals accompanied the Pakistani armed forces in launching the attack directed against civilian population of the village Alubdi (Pallabi, Mirpur) and suddenly by opening indiscriminate gun firing caused mass killing  of 344 civilians including the persons listed in the charge no.05 constituting the offence of their murder and thereby the accused had committed the offence of  ‘murder as crime against humanity’, ‘aiding and abetting’ to the commission of such offences or in the alternative he committed the offence of  ‘complicity in committing such offence’ as mentioned in section 3(2)(a)(g)(h) of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act,1973 which are punishable under section 20(2)  read with section 3(1) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Witnesses</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>308. </b>Prosecution has adduced and examined two witnesses in relation to this charge. The witnesses are P.W.6 Shafiuddin Mulla and P.W.9 Md. Amir Hossain Molla. They claim to have witnessed the atrocious event of mass killing participated by the accused Abdul Qauder Molla with the principal perpetrators. At the relevant time they were residents of the crime village Alubdi under police station Mirpur, Dhaka.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Discussion of Evidence </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>309. </b><b>P.W.6 Shafiuddin Mulla(60)</b> , at the relevant time , was an inhabitant of Alubdi village. He was 19 years of age at the time of the alleged event of mass killing happened at their village. He narrated that on 24 April 1971 in the early morning, on hearing sound of helicopter, he came out of the house and found a helicopter landing at a place near the bank of river which was western part of the village and he instantly heard sound of indiscriminate gun firing and then being frightened they started running within the village. At a stage, he found dead bodies of some persons here and there. He then remained in hiding beneath a bush at the northern side of the village and there from had witnessed, from western side, the Pakistani army bringing the villagers and the paddy harvesting laborers. There after, he also found that the accused Abdul Quader Molla, his Bihari accomplices and Pakistani army brought the villagers and the paddy harvesting laborers from eastern side and made all of them assembled at the same place.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>310. </b>P.W.6 further stated that after a short while he saw the accused Abdul Quader Molla talking with the officers of Pakistani force in Urdu, although he could not exactly hear it from far and then gun shooting was started targeting the apprehended civilians and Quader Molla (accused) also had fired by the rifle in his hand and thus, in this way, they had killed 360/370 Bangalee civilians including 70/80 paddy harvesting laborers and his own uncle Nabiullah. The massacre continued till 11:00 am and the perpetrators also committed looting and burnt houses of civilians.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>311. </b>Defence, however, could not dislodge the fact of the incident of atrocious and planned mass killing in Alubdi village, in any manner. From cross-examination of P.W.6 it has been revealed that since 24 April 1971, the date of the incident of mass killing, they had been in the locality of Savar, leaving their own village Alubdi. This fact is a corroborative indication to the commission of the horrific massacre. Because, they would not have preferred their shelter elsewhere leaving their own place if actually no such horrific incident would not happen. We do not find any reason that the P.W.6 has testified falsely as to witnessing the incident and presence of the accused Abdul Quader Mollah with the Pakistani army with a rifle in his hand at the crime site.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>312. </b>Now the question may validly come forward as to how the P.W.6 could recognize the accused at the crime site?  Had he any opportunity to know the accused from earlier? P.W.6 blatantly denied the suggestion put to him by the defence that he did not know the accused Quader Mollah in 1970-71. Rather, P.W.6 stated that he was associated with the ‘Chatra League’ (student wing of Awami League) and during 1970 election he had participated in the campaign in favour of the Awami league candidate Advocate Zahir Uddin(Mirpur constituency) while accused Abdul Qauder Molla, the then leader of Islami Chatra Sangha (ICS) and the Biharis were engaged in campaign in support of the candidate having symbol of ‘<i>dari palla’. </i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>313. </b>Thus we see that the P.W.6 was actively associated with the student wing of the Awami League, a pro-liberation political party, while accused Abdul Quader Molla had worked actively for the opponent in 1970 general election in favour of the Jamat-E-Islami candidate, in the locality of Mirpur. It has been corroborated by P.W.2 Syed Shahidul Huq Mama. Admittedly, in 1971 the Alubdi village was under Mirpur Police Station and we have found from evidence of P.W.5 Khandoker Abul Ahsan that the accused Abdul Quader Molla was also a resident of this locality (Duaripara, Mirpur). Therefore, we may legitimately presume that the P.W.6 had enough reason and occasion to know the accused Quader Molla since prior to the incident of Alubdi and thus he could recognize him even at the crime site accompanying the Pakistani army to the accomplishment of the crimes alleged.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>314. </b>Another live witness  <b>P.W.9 Amir Hossain Molla</b> testified that Abdul Quader Molla had directly participated in the killing of around 400 people at Alubdi of Pallabi in Dhaka on April 24, 1971during the Liberation War. It is seen that the above version of P.W.9 has been corroborated by P.W.5 Shafiuddin Molla, another live witness of the incident who has also stated that Abdul Quader Molla directly took part in the killing of 360-370 Bangalees in Alubdi.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>315. </b>Freedom fighter P.W.9 Amir Hossain Molla, (66), used to reside at Duaripara the neighboring locality of Alubdi, at the relevant time. P.W.9 stated that  Abdul Quader Molla along with 70-80 members of Islami Chatra Sangha, the then student wing of Jamat E Islami, had trained non-Bangalee Biharis to “protect Pakistan” ahead of the Liberation War. This unshaken piece of evidence sufficiently indicates that P.W.9 knew the accused Abdul Quader Molla even since prior to the event alleged.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>316. </b>In narrating the horrific event, P.W.9 stated that around the time of Fajr prayers on April 24, 1971, a helicopter landed on the bank of the Turag river on the west side of his village. From the east, 100-150 Biharis and Bangalees led by Abdul Quader Molla entered the village and opened fire indiscriminately causing killing of many people. Thereafter, they picked 64-65 villagers from their homes and lined them up in the north side of the village and 300-350 people who had come to the village for harvesting paddy were also lined up on the same place and then they opened fire on them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>317. </b>P.W. 9 further stated he saw Abdul Quader Molla standing there (crime site) having rifle in his hand and there was also a rifle in Aktar Goonda’s (Quader’s associate) hand. They along with Panjabi people (Pakistan army) opened fire, said the P.W.9, adding, approximately 400 people were killed there. On cross-examination P.W.9 stated that he knew Aktar goonda who was sent to jail after 31 January 1972. He lost his 21 relatives who were killed during the event. P.W.9 has re-affirmed, in his cross-examination that he and his father witnessed the event remaining in hiding at the west-north side of the village Alubdi.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Evaluation of Evidence and Finding</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>318. </b>Mr. Abdus Sobhan Tarafder , an associate of Mr. Abdur Razzak, the learned senior counsel for the defence argued that P.W.6 and P.W.9 had not been at the crime village at the relevant time and as such they had no opportunity to see the event. Their version as to seeing the accused accompanying the gang of perpetrators is not believable as they made inconsistent statement. P.W.6 just in the early morning when the attack was launched was sent to Birulia village, Savar by his uncle Nabiulla, as stated by D.W.5 Altab Uddin Molla, the younger brother of P.W.6. P.W.9 is not a credible witness as he is closely affiliated to the party in power and had faced numerous civil and criminal cases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>319. </b>Conversely, the learned prosecutor argued that both the witnesses are live witnesses and they have made corroborating testimony as to the commission of event and involvement of accused thereto. Mere discrepancies cannot <i>ipso facto</i> make the sworn testimony untrue in its entirety. Involvement with civil and criminal case does not indicate one’s ill character and merely for this reason his sworn testimony cannot go on air. Besides, defence has made a futile attempt to exclude the culpability of accused with the commission of the event of massacre by examining the younger brother of P.W.6– Altab Uddin Molla (D.W.5) who was merely a boy of 7 years and he had not been at the crime village at the relevant time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>320. </b>The incident took place only about one month after the ‘crack down’ in the night of 25 march 1971 and thus the Pakistani troops who were here coming thousand of miles far from Pakistan naturally did not have any idea and knowledge about the location of any particular place and when, how and which group of population would be targeted of their attack, in execution of the policy and plan of the Pakistani government and armed forces. Logically only the local pro-Pakistani people, at that time, were considered as right persons to assist, guide and to collaborate them to implement the operation by committing atrocity. We may take this fact of common knowledge, considering the context of war of liberation 1971 into notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>321. </b>It is thus validly inferred that the Pakistani troops had to take effective assistance and collaboration of the local people who were perfectly pro-Pakistani and affiliated with the politics of Jamat E Islami. Admittedly, accused Abdul Quader Molla was a leader of Islami Chatra Sangha, the student wing of the JEI. It has been established even from the <b>Exhibit-2 and 4</b>, the two books one of which <b>(Exhibit-4: Jibone Ja Dekhlam) </b>is written by Ghulam Azam who contested 1970 election from Mirpur locality as a candidate of JEI.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>322. </b>Context, activities and political affiliation of the accused, just prior to 1971 war of liberation, as has already been discussed reasonably and unambiguously inspire us to believe the testimony of P.W.6 in respect of presence of the accused at the crime site of Alubdi and the fact that he himself also fired from the rifle in his hand while principally the Pakistani army perpetrated the mass killing of civilians.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>323. </b>It is to be noted that defence adduced and examined Altab Uddin Molla, the younger brother of P.W.6 as D.W.5. As it appears, D.W.5 has testified mainly to exclude complicity of the accused with event of massacre (as listed in charge no.5). At the relevant time he was only about 7 years old. He does not dispute the commission of the massacre. Although the burden squarely lies upon the prosecution to prove involvement or complicity of the accused with the crime committed we consider it relevant to have look to what has been testified by the D.W.5 to determine the weight of testimony of P.W.6.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>324. </b>D.W.5 Altab Uddin Molla has corroborated that his family members took refuge to village Birulia under Savar police station after the gang of 4/5 thousand  Bihari lead by the Pakistani army along with Aktar Goonda, Doma, Gul Mohammad had attacked their village Alubdi in the night of 25 March. D.W.5 also stated that his brother Shafiuddin Molla (P.W.6) had been at village Alubdi at the time of the event and in the morning of 24 April when the Pakistani army’s helicopter had landed at their village his uncle Nabiullah Molla had sent him (P.W.6) to Birulia, Savar.  How D.W.5 became aware of this fact? It remains unexplained.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>325. </b>The Tribunal notes it with surprise that how D.W.5 came to know that his uncle Nabiullah had sent his brother Shafiuddin Molla to Birulia, Savar, particularly when it is admitted that Nabiullah Molla was also killed in conjunction of the massacre? D.W.5 remained silent in this regard.  Admittedly D.W.5 since prior to the alleged event had been at village Birulia, Savar with his family. If it is so, he is not a competent person to say whether accused Abdul Qauder Molla accompanied the perpetrators at the crime site.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>326. </b>It appears too that D.W.5 has stated that accused Abdul Qauder Molla was not at the crime site and he did not see him there. D.W.5 in next breath stated that he had not heard the name of Abdul Qauder Molla prior to initiation of this case. If it so,  he is not at all able to say whether accused Abdul Quader Molla accompanied the perpetrators to the crime site and the version that he did not see the accused at the crime site is patently an untrue version aiming to exclude involvement of the accused with the commission of massacre alleged.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>327. </b>Drawing attention to the testimony defence suggested to P.W.9 that he did not state to IO that Abdul Quader Molla had accompanied the perpetrators having rifle in hand and participated the commission of mass killing of 400 civilians by gun firing. P.W.9 denied it. The Investigation officer P.W.12 stated that this witness stated to him that “140-150 persons including Asim, Aktar goonda, Newaj, Latif, Doma led by accused Abdul Quader Molla encircled the village Alubdi approaching from the east part of village.” Besides, the Tribunal notes that minor discrepancies, if any,  could be due to the fallibility of perception and memory and the operation of the passage of time and it does not corrode the credibility of testimony  made here before the Tribunal. Hence it would be wrong and unjust to treat forgetfulness as being synonymous with giving false testimony.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>328. </b>We are not agreed with what has been submitted by the learned defence counsel in respect of credibility of P.W.9 on ground of his ‘character’. Merely involving in civil litigations and involving with a criminal prosecution cannot brand one’s character questionable and makes him incompetent to testify in a court of law. Chiefly we are to see whether and to what extent it affects the truthfulness of that witness’s testimony. Even we are not required to reject the testimony of a witness who has been convicted of a crime or has engaged in criminal conduct. We may however consider whether a witness’s criminal conviction or conduct has affected the truthfulness of the witness’</p></div></div>

In view of above settled position and in the absence of any statutory limitation, as a procedural bar, only the delay itself does not preclude prose-cutorial action to adjudicate the culpability of the perpetrator of core international crimes. Indubitably, a prompt and indisputable justice process cannot be motorized solely by the painful memories and aspirations of the victims.

Article 12 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal allowed for trials in absentia whenever the Tribunal found it necessary to do so in the interest of justice.

It is also alleged that in conjunction of the incident, the accused and his  accomplices gunned down (8) Haripada Saha residents of crime village Hasamdia and (9) Probir Kumar Saha @ Puitta to death by abducting them to  the river bank of <i>‘Maindia bazar</i>’ and thereby the accused has been charged for the physical participation and also for substantially contributing to the actual commission of offence of ‘genocide’ for ‘killing the members of Hindu community’, with intent to destroy the Hindu religious group, either whole or in part as specified in section 3(2) (c)(i) of the Act which are punishable under section 20(2) read with section 3(1) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">P.W.17 does not claim to have witnessed the accused killing his father and brother. But he has stated that he learnt instantly after the incident from Surja Kumar Das, a bullet-injured victim that accused Abul Kalam Azda @ Bachchu accompanied the army during the killing. Thus it is inferred that the accused substantially contributed and encouraged the gang of perpetrators in accomplishment of the crimes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Defence did not put any question to P.W.17 with a view to dislodge the fact of his learning the first part of the attack at village Hasamdia from him by the P.W.16. Additionally, we do not find any reasonable ground to discard the hearsay evidence as to learning the incident of killing of 7/8 persons at Hasamdia Hindu para. Rather, P.W.16 and P.W.17 seem to be natural witnesses, particularly in absence of any reason whatsoever of being interested to tell a lie.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The hearsay evidence of P.W.17 so far it relates to the fact of his learning as to involvement of accused with killing of his father and other killings and destructive acts carries reasonable probative value.<b></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Defence could not however controvert the commission of the event of crimes, by cross-examining P.W.19. Rather, his evidence has rendered corroboration to what has been testified by the P.W.16, P.W.17 on the acts of killing, destruction, looting and involvement of accused therewith. P.W.19, a live witness, is the son of one of victims of the horrific atrocities who had opportunity to witness the incident of killing his father Shayamapada Saha by remaining in hiding in a bamboo bush. It remains undisputed. Additionally, P.W.19 knew the accused from earlier as he (accused) was a resident of their neighboring village Kahrdia. P.W. 19 is a natural and live witness and there is no reason to exclude what he has testified.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Perpetration of the horrific event including murder of numerous civilians targeting the Hindu group including the father of P.W.19 on the date time and manner as narrated by a live witness P.W.19 has been proved. At the same time we have found from evidence of P.W.19 that the accused accompanied the gang of perpetrators and how he had directly partici-pated to the commission of destructive crimes. All these facts remain totally undisputed in cross-examination of P.W.19.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, considering the horrendous nature of crimes the event could not be expected to have been witnessed by numerous persons. Incidentally some one might have opportunity of seeing it remaining in hiding at a place adjacent to the crime site. Apart from them, other person cannot be perceived to have seen the event of massacre. So, the perpetration of crime and acts and conduct of perpetrators could have been learnt from an injured victim or person who had incidental opportunity of seeing the event. It is quite natural and thus the testimony of P.W.17 and P.W.20 though hearsay inspires credence, particularly when such hearsay testimony gets fair corroboration from live witness’s (P.W.16 and P.W.19) account.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It has also been established from evidence of P.W.16. P.W.17, P.W.19 and P.W 20  that few days after the horrendous crimes almost all the members of the Hindu community residing at the crime village including the relatives of victims and sufferers became compelled to deport to India leaving their properties, houses etc. and they returned back only after achieving the victory on 16 December. That is to say, the cumulative effect of the atrocities including killing, destruction and looting of properties, mental harms compelling the Hindu community of the crime village inevitably imprints an unmistakable notion that the aim and intent of the perpetrators was to destroy the ‘Hindu group or community’, in part. This notion is qualified as ‘genocidal intent’ as required to constitute the offence of ‘genocide’. It remains totally uncontroversial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have found from evidence of P.W.16, P.W 17, P.W 19 and P.W. 20 that at the time of commission of crimes narrated in charge no.7 Pakistani army and some armed civilian accomplices were also with the accused Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu. It is also found that the accused had rendered, apart from his physical participation as found from testimony of P.W.16 and P.W.19, assistance, encourage-ment and moral support which had substantial effect on the perpetration of the massive crimes as has been listed in charge no.7. It is proved that the accused accompanied the armed perpetrators and  he was physically present at the crime scenes and thus  he is deemed to have rendered ‘tacit approval’ to the accomplishm-ent of the event of massacre.  Besides, in conjunction of the commission of the event of massacre, accused Abul Kalam Azada @ Bachchu himself too actively and directly participated to the commission of the acts of killings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It has been established that accused Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu was a potential associate of Pakistani army and also was a sig-nificant armed member of volunteer Razakar force which was organized after the Pakistani army struck Faridpur on 21 April 1971. This being the status that the accused was holding at relevant time, his presence at the crime site as an active accomplice of the principals inevitably prompts us to infer that, in addition to his direct participation of killing at the time of commission of the event of massacre,  he substantially provided practical assistance, encouragement and moral support to the principals i.e co-perpetrators in perpetration of the offence of genocide that resulted in mass killing of individuals belonging to ‘Hindu Community’ which is a ‘distinct religious group’ and mass destruction and thereby he incurs liability under section 4(1) of the Act for the offence of genocide as specified in section 3(2)(c) (i) of the Act of 1973.<b>  …(112, 113, 133-135, 139, 140, 144, 147, 167 and 170)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Adjudication of charge No. 01</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(Abduction confinement and torture of Ranjit Nath @ Babu Nath)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (XIX of 1973)  </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sections 3(1), 3(2)(a) and 20(2)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu(absconded) a member of Razaker Force  and subsequently the local commander of Al-Badar Bahini and or as a member of group of individuals being accompanied by accomplices is alleged to have abducted , tortured and confined Ranjit Nath @ Babu Nath , during the first week of June ,1971 as narrated in the charge No. 01 and thereby he has been charged for the physical participation and also for substantially contributing to the actual commission of offence of <b>‘abduction, confinement and torture as crime against humanity’</b> by directing attack against the Hindu civilian population as specified in section 3(2) (a) of the Act which are punishable under section 20(2) read with section 3(1) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the evidence of P.W.5, the victim of the offence of abduction, confinement and torture and P.W.15, it is proved that after apprehendi-ng him(P.W.5) he was brought to the Pakistan army camp at Faridpur circuit house where he found accused Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu holding a meeting with Major Koraishi. Mujahid , Afzal and others and there from, on direction of Mujahid  the accused Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu and his associates blindfold-ded him (P.W.5 Ranjit) and took him to Faridpur Zilla School ground and put him under a palm tree and had beaten him up for one hour and then he was kept confined in a house inside the Bihari colony and around midnight he (P.W.5 Ranjit) escaped breaking through a window. Defence could not dislodge this incriminating version in any manner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The context itself as reflected from policies adopted by the Pakistani army and its local pro-Pakistan political organization, chiefly the Jamat E Islami (JEI) and ‘auxiliary forces’ is sufficient to prove the existence of the notion of ‘systematic attack’ on Bangladeshi self-determined population in 1971, during the War of Liberation.  This context unerringly prompts us in arriving at decision that the atrocities committed upon P.W.5 Ranjit Kumar Nath was a part of systematic attack constituting the offences of crimes against humanity as specified in section 3(2)(a) of the Act of 1973.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Accused Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu is thus criminally liable under section 4(1) of the Act of 1973 for physical participation and also for providing substantial contribution to the commission of offence of <b>abduction, confinement and torture as crime against humanity as specified in section </b>3(2)(a) of the Act which are punishable under section 20(2) read with section 3(1) of the Act.                                                   <b>… (172, 183—187).</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Adjudication of charge No. 02</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(Abduction confinement and Torture on  Abu Yusuf Pakhi)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (XIX of 1973)  </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sections 3(2) (a) and 4 (1)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu(absconded) a member of Razaker Force  and subsequently the local commander of Al-Badar Bahini and or as a member of group of individuals being accompanied by accomplices  is alleged to have abducted , tortured and confined Abu Yusuf Pakhi  , on 26 July 1971 during the war of liberation, as narrated in the charge no.02 and thereby he has been charged for the physical participation and also for substantially contributing to the actual commission of offence of ‘abduction, confinement and torture as crime against humanity’ by directing attack against the Hindu civilian population as specified in section 3(2) (a) of the Act which are punishable under section 20(2) read with section 3(1) of the Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>P.W.18 in narrating the fact of his abduction has stated that on April 22, 1971, Kamaruzzaman Jasu, cousin of Azad (accused), picked him (P.W.18) and his brother from the intersection of Bhanga Road and handed them to the army. And then  they were produced before Pakistani Major Akram Koreshi at Faridpur Circuit House where  he saw Pakistani army shooting a few people to death on the east side of the Circuit House. They were then brought to Major Akram Koraishi of the camp and his brother (who was apprehended with P.W.18) had talk with Major Koraishi in English and then they were released from the camp by another Pakistan army’s Baluch Major and then he joined the war of liberation, P.W.18 Yusuf added.

But for holding the accused criminally liable for the crimes alleged it has to be established that he participated or substantially contributed or facilitated to the commission of the offence of confinement and causing torture.

Obviously such second attempt of abducting the traumatized victim Anjali Das made her panicked and frightened which eventually forced her to commit suicide. Who is this Mohammad Kazi? As it is found, he was the brother-in-law of the accused. That is to say, the second attempt to take away the victim forcibly was not done without the knowledge of the accused.

The accused, in furtherance of policy and plan of the Pakistani army and the organization collaborating it launched such attack directing the Hindu community, a part of civilian population and the criminal acts were done in context of the war of liberation in 1971. Therefore, the accused Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu is found to have incurred </b><b>criminal liability under section 4(1) of the Act and found guilty for committing the offence of abduction, confinement and torture as crimes against humanity as specified in section 3(2) (a) of the Act which is punishable under section 20(2) read with section 3(1) of the Act . …(389, 390, 302-306)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (XIX of 1973)  </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Section 3(2)(a)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Crimes against humanity- Proof of </b><b>in determining the fact as to whether the atrocious acts which are already proved to have been committed were directed against Bengali civilian population constituting the crimes against humanity in 1971 during the War of Liberation it is to be considered that the criminal acts committed in violation of customary international law constituting the offences enumerated in section 3(2)(a) of the Act of 1973  were connected to some policy of the government or an organization. It is to be noted too that such policy and plan are not the required elements to constitute the offence of crimes against humanity. These may be taken into consideration as factors for the purpose of deciding the context upon which the offences were committed. It is indeed a history now that the Pakistani army with the aid of its auxiliary forces, pro-Pakistan political organizations implemented the commission of atrocities in 1971 in the territory of Bangladesh in furtherance of following policies:</b></p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><b>Policy was to target the self-determined Bangladeshi civilian population</b></li><li><b>High level political or military authorities, resources military or other were involved to impleme-nt the policy</b></li><li><b>Auxiliary forces were established in aiding the  implementation of the policy</b><b></b></li><li><b>The regular and continuous horrific pattern of atrocities perpetrated against the targeted non combatant civilian popula-tion.    </b><b></b></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The above facts in relation to policies are not only widely known but also beyond reasonable dispute. The context itself reflec-ted from above policies is sufficient to prove that the offences of crimes against humanity as specified in section 3(2)(a) of the Act of 1973 were the inevitable effect of part of systematic attack directed against civilian population. This view finds support from the observation made by the Trial Chamber of ICTY in the case of <i>Blaskic </i>as mentioned above. It is quite coherent from the facts of common knowledge involving the backdrop of our war of liberation for the cause of self determination that the Pakistani armed force, in execution of government’s plan and policy in collaboration with the local anti liberation section belonging to JEI and its student wing ICS and auxiliary forces, had to deploy public and private resources and target of such policy and plan was  the unarmed civilian Bangalee population, pro-liberation people, Hindu community and pursuant to such plan and policy atrocities were committed to them as a ‘part of a regular pattern basis’ through out the long nine months of war of liberation. It may be legitimately inferred from the phrase “directed against any civilian population” as contained in the Act of 1973 that the acts of the accused comprise part of a pattern of ‘systematic’ crimes directed against civilian population. Therefore, the crimes for which the accused has been charged and found guilty were not isolated crimes, rather these were part of organized and planned attack intended to commit the offence of crimes against humanity as enumerated in section 3(2) of the Act, in furtherance of policy and plan.       …(312, 314, 315, 316 and 318)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>International Crimes (Tribunals) Act (XIX of 1973)  </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Section 3(2)(c) (i),</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Section 3(2) (c)(i) of the Act of 1973</b><b> defines ‘Genocide’ as an act committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, religious or political group, such as, killing members of the group.

From testimony of most of witnesses it has been established that almost instantly after accomplishment of crimes targeting the Hindu community, the members of this community who were residents of the crime villages deported to India, in fear of further fatality and harms.

At all stages of proceedings the prosecution and the defence have made laudable efforts extending their precious arguments on academic and legal aspects including citation of the evolved jurisprudence. It inevitably has inspired us to address the legal issues closely involved in the case, together with the factual aspects as well. We take the privilege to appreciate their significant endeavor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In delivering the verdict we have deemed it necessary in highlighting some issues, in addition to legal and factual aspects, relating to historical and contextual background, chara-cterizeation of crimes, commencement of proceedings, procedural history reflecting the entire proceedings, charges framed, in brief, and the laws applicable to the case for the purpose of determining culpability of the accused. Next, together with the factual aspects we have made effort to address the legal issues involved and then discuss and evaluate evidence adduced in relation to charges independently and finally have penned our finding on culpability of accused.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, having regard to section 10(1) (j), section 20(1) and section 20(2) of the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973[Act No. XIX of 1973] this ‘Tribunal’ known as International Crimes Tribunal-2 (ICT-2) hereby renders and pronouncing the following judgment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>II.

But the warrant could not be executed as the accused remained absconded. Thereafter, in compliance of legal requirement for holding trial in <i>absentia</i> by appointing state defence counsel to defend the absconded accused, the Tribunal on hearing both sides on charge framing matter framed 08 charges against the accused Abul Kalam Azad @ Bachchu by its order dated 04 November 2012 and thus the trial commenced. <b> </b></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>III. Historical Background</b></p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><b>3.          </b>Atrocious and horrendous crimes were committed during the nine-month-long war of liberation, which resulted in the birth of Bangladesh, an independent state. Some three million people were killed, nearly quarter million women were raped and over 10 million people were forced to flee to India to escape brutal persecution at home, during the nine-month battle and struggle of Bangalee nation. The perpetrators of the crimes could not be brought to book, and this left a deep wound on the country’s political psyche and the whole nation. The impunity they enjoyed held back political stability, saw the ascend of militancy, and destroyed the nation’s Constitution.</li><li><b>4.          </b>A well-known researcher on genocide, <b>R.J. Rummel</b>, in his book <b>Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900</b>, states:</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">“In East Pakistan [General Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan and his top generals] also planned to murder its Bengali intellectual, cultural, and political elite. They also planned to indiscrimi-nately murder hundreds of thousands of its Hindus and drive the rest into India. And they planned to destroy its economic base to insure that it would be subordinate to West Pakistan for at least a generation to come.”</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><b>5.          </b>Women were tortured, raped and killed. With the help of its local collaborators, the Pakistan military kept numerous Bengali women as sex slaves inside their camps and cantonments<b>. Susan Brownmiller</b>, who condu-cted a detailed study, has estimated the number of raped women at over 400,000.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>[Source</b>: <a href="http://bangladeshwatchdog1.wordpress.com/razakars/">http://bangladeshwatchdog1.wordpress.com/razakars/</a>]</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li><b>6.          </b>In August, 1947, the partition of British India based on two-nation theory, gave birth to two new states, one a secular state named India and the other the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The western zone was eventually named West Pakistan and the eastern zone was named East Pakistan, which is now Bangladesh.</li><li><b>7.          </b>In 1952 the Pakistani authorities attempt-ted to impose ‘Urdu’ as the only State language of Pakistan ignoring Bangla, the language of the majority population of Pakistan. The people of the then East Pakistan started movement to get Bangla recognized as a state language thus marking the beginning of language movement that eventually turned to the movement for greater autonomy and self-determination and eventually independence.</li><li><b>8.          </b>In the general election of 1970, the Awami League under the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became the majority party of Pakistan. Despite this overwhelming majority, Pakistan Government did not hand over power to the leader of the majority party as democratic norms required. As a result, movement started in this part of Pakistan and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his historic speech of 7<sup>th</sup> March, 1971, called on the people of Bangladesh to strive for independence if people’s verdict is not respected and power is not handed over to the leader of the majority party.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>In real world, there are many people made investment to increase their wealth, purchase company debentures and shares are common ways. However, most of the shareholder and debentures holder have minor access or no access to the management of the company dislike the other shareholder or debentures holder are composition of the Board of Directors or the director themselves. Thus, there is ignorance of interest of the shareholder or debentures holders who not fall within the centre of the power in companyâ€™s conduct or the majority component of the management exercise their power in oppressive manner. In order to protect the minority, S181 under Companies Act entitle the minority claim remedies in case of oppression.</p><p>According to Companies Act under S181, in case of oppression, the qualified proposer to claim remedies is member of company; include 1) anyone who listed in the register of members of the company (Owen Sim Liang Khui v Piasau Jaya Sdn. Bhd &amp; Anor [1996] 1 MLJ 113); 2) anyone who owned companyâ€™s shares or debentures and be treated as a member by company or the board (applied doctrine of estoppel); 3) company depositor who named in record of depositors not less than 3 days fall between Monday to Friday and not public holiday or market holiday of Bursa Malaysia.</p><p>The minor (underage of 18) also can be company member which subjected to contract law. Basically, there are no restriction of age and sexual of member of company since the register of member just with certain prescribed info such as memberâ€™s liability or contribution towards company. For those shareholder who ceased to become member due to death, bankruptcy, or unable to administering their own affairs, personal representative can be appointed to replace them to be member. Besides, the membership also can be transfer to another people in form of inheritance through the WILL of dead member.</p><p>Other than that, according to the amendment to the Companies Act, insertion S181A (4), the qualified proposer to claim remedy other than one who mention above, include: company former member if the claim relates to circumstances in which the member ceased to be a member ; any directors of a company ; or declared companyâ€™s Registrar.</p><p><strong>The Circumstances to Claim Remedies</strong></p><p>According to the rule in Foss v Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461, the minority of companyâ€™s member (shareholder and debentures holder) had been restrict to sue or brought action to company, the majority of members, board of directors or companyâ€™s director since the damage or loss was due to negligence of directors and majority of members who suffer the same loss and not with any form of benefit, the case Pavlides v Jensen [1956] Ch 565 best explain it. The plaintiff claims that the defendants (companyâ€™s directors and company itself) sold the company owned mine undervalue inattentive, thus the wrong done need to be redress. However, the action of plaintiff was not maintainable due to the decision of selling the mine was decided by the majority not the defendants and it based on the reach of common consent.</p><p>S181 (1) stated that the company member allow to leave of court if their interest as company shareholders being disregard, powers of directors are exercise in oppressive manner, board of directors or majority member have power to resist the action or prevent the redress of wrong done, affairs of company being conducted in oppressive manner or capacity as member been unfairly prejudicial or unfairly discriminatory against.</p><p>Conditions above are fall under the exception of Foss v Harbottle (1843) â€“ Fraud of minority. It means that the wrongdoers fall under centre power and controlling the company, thus they have power to prevent the redress action. The wrongdoers can be company directors or majority member. In statutory to prove that whether they are constitute a fraud, exercise their power in oppressive manner or their action been regarded as unfairly prejudicial or unfairly discriminatory towards a member, there are few grounds must be shown. First, the majority obtained benefit from company to themselves; second, by depressed the company, obtaining benefit; last, preventing redress action being brought.</p><p>There are few circumstances and real world case support action of the member to claim remedy. First, setting up subsidiary company into different and use it as a tool to enter different business field. In order to involve company into different business, sometimes the company will set up a subsidiary and raise fund then allow the company engage in the industry then winding up the subsidiary since the purpose to engage in new business must fulfilled. The case Scottish Cooperative Co. v Meyer [1959] perfectly reflected the circumstances above. The plaintiffs who are the minority shareholders of the subsidiary company claim that the defendants (majority shareholders) action of setting up the subsidiary and then winding up the subsidiary after the subsidiary helps the company enters the rayon industry is with bad intention, it leads to the shares hold by the plaintiffs become priceless. Thus S181 been applied and the company was ordered to redress it by purchase the shares owned by plaintiffs at fair value.</p><p>Second, some companies are fall under control of the majority member, the majority member (shareholders) sometimes are employed as director or in board of directors which have power to control over the company funds and assets, some of them may fulfilled self- interests or benefits by withdrawing companyâ€™s funds and these can be regarded as oppressive conduct and minority member can sued the majority shareholders by application of S181 (1) (a) in Companies Act. Eric Lau Man Hing v Eramara Jaya Sdn. Bhd. &amp; Ors [1998] and Low Peng Boon v Low Janie [1999] case can be best cases to represent the circumstances mentioned above. Both defendants in these two cases withdrawing company funds to fulfil self-interest, one of them deposit the fund in joint names or individual fixed deposit accounts and one of them withdraw it for personal interest.</p><p>The two cases above also reflected that these are circumstances the shareholders suffer non- payment of dividend or dividend paid was inadequate compare to the majority, both plaintiffs in these cases did not received payment of dividend due to misappropriation of company funds withdrawing by the majority member who composited board of directors and lead to improper records of company fundâ€™s amount. Another reason of non-payment of dividend was the majority shareholders derive the funds as director fees and benefit themselves by receiving tremendous amount from company in formed of salaries but not declaring dividend. This circumstance can be considered as the minority shareholders entitled to sue under S181 (1) (b) in Companies Act 1965 which stated that ” a remedy could be claimed if the action of the company which run in good faith but result in contrast to the interest of minority shareholders, yet the action can be claimed as unfairly prejudicial and discriminatory.”</p><p>The facts in Sanford v Sanford Courier Service Pty Ltd (1986) stated that the Defendants diverted the business from the company to another company which control by Defendants and get high director fees, motor vehicles and wealth retirement scheme in return. At the same time make non-payment of dividend to Plaintiffs. The Judge held that both actions of company favouring directors by given benefits and refuse to pay dividend were necessarily injustice discrimination and prejudicial.</p><p>In the Companies (Amendment) Laws, there are circumstances that if the complainants fall under S181A (4) found that the majority or director of company ratify or approve the conduct, the subject matter of the action- the ratification or approval does not prevent any person from bringing, intervening in or defending proceedings with the leave of court [Companies Amendment Act 2007-S181D (a)]. It means that the complainant can apply leave of the court to intervene the ratified conduct by the majority even there are not fraud on minority and due to the negligence of any empowered party. This new statutory derivative action is completely set out the rule of Foss v Harbottle which claimed that the ratified conduct made by majority and director are irrevocable (Pavlides v Jensen [1956]).</p><p><strong>Examine the Circumstances to Claim</strong></p><p>According to the S181 Companies Act, the circumstances to claim are too rigid to the applicant. To claim remedies, the qualified proposer need to fulfil the rules in the Foss v Harbottle under the ground of fraud on minority or prove that the conduct or act of the company which decided by the majority and directors are in oppressive manner or claimed as unfairly prejudicial and unfairly discriminatory. There are few considerations made by qualified applicant when they applied common law derivative to claim remedies. Those considerations are based on economical, constraint accessibility to company internal and feasibility to revoke the wrong done which have been ratified.</p><p>First, the economic constraints, the cost to process the claim of remedies need to bear by the minority shareholder who commences the application of derivative action. Before the application of claiming remedies, the applicant needs to prove that he or she or they have the locus standi to sue in a preliminary hearing, the cost involved to prove the locus standi bear by the applicant. Cost involved in claiming remedy could be burdensome to the applicant, then the shareholder may be reluctant to bring action since he need to use his own funds to proceed. Even the court held that the damage should be awarded but lastly the amount of damage awarded will go to company and benefit the whole body of shareholders but not compensable to the applicant. Case Tang Khor Ham &amp; Ors v Pengurusan Danaharta National Bhd &amp;Ors proved that, the application of claiming remedies is fraught with problem, in the end, the minority shareholders awarded unattractive remedy.</p><p>Second, the accessibility of minority shareholder determines whether they can be locus standi to sue. To claim remedies, the minority at first, need to fulfil the requirement to establish that the conduct or action of company affair are fall under â€˜fraud of minorityâ€™ which the majority have the power to prevent the redress action bring to them. However, the extent and definition of â€˜fraud of minorityâ€™ are ambiguous and with a lot of restrictions. Minority shareholders must use the law case and compared whether the situation of law cases are similar to the existing situation he/she or they met. The least accessibility to internal information regarding company of the minority shareholders or the majority with power to prevent the minority shareholders to get knowledge about company limit the chance of minority shareholders to prove there are oppressive prejudicial action towards them.</p><p>Last, once the wrong doing has been ratified by majority of shareholders, the wrong doing is hard to revoke. Like the situation in Pavlides v Jensen (1956), the decision of selling the mine under-value to another company was due to the negligence of directors and the minority shareholders cannot sue the director since the selling of mine had been brought to meeting and agreed by majority shareholders. According to S181 in Companies Act, ratification by majority shareholders regard a wrong done was amount to a decision not to sue as respect to the wrongdoers (Choong and Sujata, 2008). Besides, the case law did not set down a clean principle to what extent the wrong doing can be ratified by shareholders except the situation that the company assets had been withdraw.</p><p>To enhance the protection over the minority shareholders, there are amendments made to S181 of Companies Act by insertion of new subsection. The new subsection covered few area of claiming remedies. S181A stated that the proceedings can be bringing on behalf of a company by the range of complainant. S181 B stated the procedure of application for leave of court. S181 C listed that any proceedings brought under S181 A shall not be discontinued except with the leave of the court. S181 D determined the effect of ratification and S181 E defined the power of the court (Companies Amendment Act, 2007).</p><p>However, the new act from S181 A- S181 E increase the chance of statutory dispute of a company and it causes some injustice to company itself. In order to explain it more clearly, the case Mohd Shuaib Ishak v Celcom (Malaysia) Bhd which deals with the amendment Act been deployed. In this case, the Plaintiff who also the former member of Celcom (defendant) was qualified to apply for the leave of court to bring action on the respectful business decision was made by Celcom director as the applicant related to the circumstances in which the member ceased to be a member has fulfilled the meaning of “complainant” under S181 A (4) (b). S181 A wider the range of â€˜complainantâ€™ and allow no person to defend or discontinued any proceedings on behalf of a company. These lead to the high intervention of people to the business conduct of company (Lee Shih, 2009).</p><p>In this case, the intention of Plaintiff to sue directors fulfil the requirement of S181B (4) (a) with good faith (b) appears prima facie for best interest of the company and he complied the procedural requirement under S181B (2) which the complainant shall give 30 days notice in writing to the director of his intention to apply for the leave of court (Companies Amendment Act, 2007). Plaintiff intention to sue can be proved in this case, however, in other case, the intention of complainant are hard to define whether for company best interest or with any collateral benefits. If the intention of complainant unable to go through a strict assessment in order to prove that it fulfilled S181B (4) (a)&amp;(b), the amendment act will be a tool to prevent company to perform their business conduct.</p><p>According to S181 C, once the action is proceeding, there are not allowed self-settlement, all of the action to discontinue, compromise or settle of the proceedings must with the leave of court. To overcome the difficulties in term of cost to bring a proceedings, S181E (1) (d)&amp;(e) been stated. According to what stated under S181E (1) (a)&amp;(b), the court require company to burden the reasonable legal fees, disbursements incurred in application for leave also the cost of the complainant for proceedings. In the end, this section just lead to the blight of company assets as the company need to pay all the relevant cost no matter the complainant is the successful party or not. Since the cost will bear by company, it encourages any person who falls under categories of complaint to apply for proceedings. The relevant costs can be a tremendous amount.</p><p><strong>Recommendation on Amendment to the Malaysian Law</strong></p><p>Even though amendment of S181 was on behalf of providing more thorough protection to those â€˜complainantâ€™ under S181A (4), however it also lead to injustice to the company since it increase the chance of â€˜complainantâ€™ to interfere and doubt the decision made by BOD and companyâ€™s director at the same time blight the company assets since the company requiring by S181E (d) and (e) to burden the relevant imbursement in the process of application. Other than blight company asset in term of monetary, the human resources also been required related with the proceedings, the company should always prepare to assist in the investigation of companyâ€™s books. Thus there are recommendations to the Companies (Amendment) Act 2007 to avoid injustice cause by the amendment statutory derivative action.</p><p>First, the court must carefully screen through the qualification of the applicant, ensure that he/she/they are qualified by fulfilled the requirement of S181A (4) (a)-(d) about the complainant before granted the leave of court, requiring those complainant fulfil the procedural requirement in S181B (2) which give 30 days notice in writing about their application. If the applicant fail to comply with the requirement, then the time, money and effort of a company in the application can be avoid.</p><p>Second, strictly examine the intention of the applicant, whether they made application in good faith and for the best interest of the company which fall under requirement of S181B (4) (a) and (b). Sometimes the intention of the applicant may aim for the collateral benefit if they get the granted leave of court. For example to harm the reputation of the company as it can be company precious assets in business negotiation or gaining contract.</p><p>Third, the court must acquiring the applicant to provide substance evidence based on the ground of â€˜fraud on minorityâ€™ or the directors with intention to carry out the oppressive business conduct in order to support the application and the loss or damage could suffer by company if the oppressive action are continued. If the applicant fails to do so, then the court would not grant the leave of court.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>In summary, the eligible applicant are the complainant who fall under the S181A (4) (a) to (d) including company member or who entitle to be an member like companyâ€™s depositors, shareholder and debenture holder been treat by the Board as member, representative of shareholder who ceased to be a member; former member of a company with terms and conditions; companyâ€™s director; or the Registrar of declare company.</p><p>The applicant are eligible to claim remedy if their interest are been disregard or been treat in basis of unfairly prejudicial and discriminatory or they found that the directors and majority shareholder exercise their power in oppressive manner or the majority with the power to prevent redress action.</p><p>The circumstances to claim remedy are restrict by the Foss v Harbottle rule as the applicant should prove the majority shareholder conduct action or propose action based on the ground of “fraud on minority”. Before the amendment to the Companies Act 1965, the circumstances to claim remedy are too rigid to the applicant and discourage them to take action as there is economic constraint on minority shareholder capability to bear the cost and enjoy the least damage awarded, have no accessibility to do inspection of companyâ€™s books and low feasibility to revoke the oppressive conduct which had been ratified by the majority shareholder.</p><p>After the amendment to the Act, the applicant been encourage doing so as the range of qualified proposer are increase; company acquired to bear the cost incurred in the application of leave of court; with the power of court, the applicant entitle to get assist and gain information including access to inspection of companyâ€™s book; interfere the oppressive conduct or propose act which decide by the majority shareholder and directors. However, it leads to injustice to the company in term of monetary, freedom of director to make decision without interference and the damage of reputation.</p><p>Thus, to overcome the rigidity impose to the company, there are recommendations provided. The court should carefully revise the application with investigation of applicant qualification as complainant, strictly examine the intention of complainant to bring the statutory derivative action without any collateral purpose, and with good faith or for company best interest, require some substance evidence about the oppressive conduct or any evidence that related to the ground of â€˜Fraud on minorityâ€™.</p></div></div>

As a common question of law is involved, they are heard analogously and disposed of by one judgment. The question is whether under the provisions of section 10(2) (vi) of the Income Tax Act read with rule 9 of the Income Tax Rules the initial depreciation is allowable to vessels belong to non-resident companies which did not ply in Pakistan waters and which had not been installed in Pakistan.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. The respondent-assessees are non-resi­dent shipping companies. Their registrations are in the United States of America. The Companies received some of their incomes in the then Pakistan by their ships touching Pakistan ports for loading and unloading car­goes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. The respondents were assessed to income tax by the Income Tax Officer, Com­panies Circle 1, Chittagong for the assessment year 1966-67, 1962-63 and 1963-64 and in so doing he disallowed the claim for initial depre­ciation of their new ships used by them in res­pective years of assessment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. Against the said orders, the assessees preferred direct appeals to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Dacca Bench. The Tri­bunal held that initial and additional deprecia­tions were allowable and directed the Income Tax Officer to make fresh assessments by allow­ing initial and additional depreciations in accordance with law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. The appellant applied to the High Court, East Pakistan    under section 66(1) of the Income Tax Act praying that the Tribunal do refer the following questions of law:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(i) “Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal had correctly incorporated the provisions of section 10(2)(vi) of the I.T. Act and Rule 9 (old rule 8) of the I.T. Rules and was justified in allowing initial and additional depreciations in respect of the vessels which did not ply in Pakistan waters during the period in question and which had not been installed in Pakistan.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(ii) Whether the absence of the word ‘Pakistan’ after the words ‘has been installed’ in section 10(2) (vi) of the IT. Act and after the word installed in rule 9 (old rule 8) of the I.T. Rules is a bar for disallowance of the benefit of initial and additional depreciation in respect of the plant and machineries which are not installed in Pakistan.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. The Tribunal rejected the applications and refused to refer the question to the High Court holding that the same question was considered  in the case of American Export lines and that  there was no cogent reason for taking a different view in these cases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. Against the orders of refusal, the appel­lant by an application in each case under sec­tion 66(2)  of the Income Tax Act moved the High Court of East  Pakistan for an order directing the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Dacca to refer the question of law set out above for decision of i he said Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8.  A Division Bench of the High Court, first issued a rule calling upon the respondents to show cause why the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal should not be directed to refer the aforesaid question of law to the High Court for decision but after hearing  the parties the learned Judges were pleased to discharge the Rules holding that the common question is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of <strong><em>United Netherlands Navigation Co. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Dacca (1965) 17 DLR SC 446—P.L.D. 1965 S.C. 412.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. From the facts set out above we find that the accounting years and the assessment years   in the three appeals are as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Appeal                    Accounting                                  assessment</p><p style="text-align: justify;">year                                               year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C.A. 15-D                1965                 Calendar                 1966-67</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of 1971                                            year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C.A. 16-D                 1961                  -do-                      1962-63.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of 1971</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C.A. 17-D               1962                    -do-                       1963-64.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of 1971</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10.  The assessees are foreign shipping companies registered in U.S.A. The Com­panies ply their ships in different countries of the world including the then Pakistan. They introduced and used for the first time new ships in each of the assessment years. The dispute centres   round the allowance of initial depre­ciation to the new ships under section 10(2) (vi) of the Income Tax Act. It is conceded that, even if ships did not call at any of the Pakistani ports, whether the allowance will be allowable. The Income Tax Officer allowed normal de­preciation and it is not in dispute but he did not allow initial depreciation. It was challenged on appeal before the Tribunal which allowed both initial and additional depreciations under different provisions of the Art. It is to be observed that the assessees claimed allowance of initial depreciation only and not additional depreciation and so the decision of the Tribunal allowing additional depreciation is uncalled for and will not govern the orders of assess­ment. We proceed to deal with the narrow question, whether the assessees are entitled to the allowance of initial depreciation under section 10(2) (vi) of the Income Tax Act. The High Court held that the question in substance is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court Pakistan in the case of <strong><em>United  Netherland Navigation Co. Ltd.</em></strong> The Evacuee obtained leave on the ground that the Finance Act, 1967 amended Income Tax Act inter alia by introducing the words ‘in Pakistan’ after the words ‘installed in s. 10(2)(vi) and so required fresh consideration of the point . in the light of the amendment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">11. In view of the peculiar facts of these three appeals, we are not called upon the cons­true   the true meaning of the amendment, but to examine whether the amendment at all applied to years of assessments under appeal. The Finance Act 1967 has not been given a retrospective operation. From the facts set out  above  it is manifest that Appeal Nos. 16 and 17 relating to assessment years 1962-63 and 1963-64 are clearly out-side the amend­ment of 1967. The only marginal case is that of accounting year 1965 i.e., 1965-66 in C.A. Appeal No. 15 corresponding to assessment year 1966-67.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12. Before dealing with the  applicability of the amendment the authority of the Privy Council on the operation of the Income Tax Act and the Finance Act as propounded in <strong><em>Maharajah of Pithpurara Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, AIR 1945 (P.C.) 89</em></strong> may be seen. <strong>Lord Thankerton</strong> propounded the proposition as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Before dealing with the particular grounds of appeal, their Lordships consi­der it desirable to make some general observations as to Indian Income Tax law, which may clear away a certain con­fusion of thought which would appear to affect certain of the contentions in the present case. In the first place, it is clear to their Lordships that under the express terms of s. 3, Income Tax Act, 1922, the subject of charge is not the income of the year of assessment, but the income of the previous year. This is in direct contrast to the English In­come Tax Acts, under which the subject of assessment is the income of the year of assessment, though the amount is measured by a yardstick based on pre­vious years. The difference is well illus­trated by the distinction that in England the source of income must still be extent in the year of assessment but that is not of relevance in India. Their Lordships may refer to the able judgment of <strong>Rankin C.J.</strong> in <strong><em>2 ITC 328</em></strong>, with which they agree.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second place, it should be remembered that the Income Tax Act, 1922, as amended from time to time forms a code,’ which has no operative effective so far as it is rendered applicable for the recovery of tax imposed for a particular fiscal year by a Finance Act. This may be illustrated by pointing out that there was no charge on the 1938-1939 income, until the passing of the Finance Act of 1939, which imposed the tax for 1939-1940 on the 1938-1939 income and au­thorised the present assessment. By sub-section (1) of s. 6, Finance, Act, 1939, income tax for the year beginning on 1st April, 1939, is directed to be charged at the rates specified in Part 1 of Sche­dule 2, and rates of super-tax are also provided for, and by sub-section (3) it is pro­vided that :</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“for the purpose of this section and of Schedule 2, the expression ‘total in­come means total income as determined for the purposes of income-tax or su­per tax as the case may be, in accord­ance with provisions of the Income tax Act, J922″. This can only refer to the Income-Tax Act, 1922, as it stood amended at the date of the Finance Act, 1939, and necessarily includes the alternations made by the Amending Act, which had already come into force on 1st April, 1939.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">13. The position is that the Income Tax Act is a dormant act and is activated year to year as for the recovery of the tax on income at the fate provided in Finance Act. Income tax is assessed on the previous year set out in the Act. The machinery for realisation of the tax is furnished by the Finance Act of the year of assessment. The law in operation on the first date of assessment year will clinch and govern the income of the previous year which in terms of the Act is the date immediately ending on the first day of the assessment year. The same view has been taken by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of <strong><em>Radhashyam Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax East Pakistan 12 DLR (SC) 25.</em></strong> The facts were that the jute business which was sought to be assessed was started on 16-9-50 and the accounts of the busi­ness were closed on 29-6-51. The Finance Act governing assessment of 1951-52 came into force on 1-4-51. The Control Board Revenue issued a notification declaring that “in case of all assesses during the second 1950-51, not having carried on business before 1st October 1949 to determine the previous year for the purpose of their assessment for 1951-52 to be the period of 12 months ending on the 30th June, 1951”. The question was whether the notification could affect the asse­ssee. The Supreme Court of Pakistan follow­ing the authority of Privy Council in the case of <strong><em>Maharajah of Pithampuram, and other</em></strong> deci­sions held that when the liability of the assessee has come into existence, it cannot be altered in quantum, context and character except by direct retrospective legislation. The Cen­tral Board of Revenue on 28-8-51 could not affect the assessee without giving a retrospec­tive operation to the notification.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">14.  Turning   to the facts   of the present case we find that the assessees observed calen­dar years and their accounting years ended on the last day of December. We are however concerned with the calendar year 1965 that is 1965-66 corresponding to assessment year 1966-67. In terms of Income-tax Act, the previous year will be deemed to have ended on 30th June, 1966. On 1 July 1966 came the Finance Act of 1966 governing the assessment of income   tax of the previous year 1965-66. The Finance Act of 1967 will govern the pre­vious year ending on 30th June 1967 that is 1966-67 corresponding to assessment year 1967-68. The Finance Act of 1967 was not made operative retrospectively. It will not and cannot affect the year of assessment of under appeal. And so we conclude the point in the leave order.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">15.  Mr. A.W. Chowdhury learned counsel for the  Revenue  has attempted to argue  that even without the amendment of the words “Pakistan”, the word ‘installed’ in clause (vi) carries by necessary implication the meaning that they were installed in Pakistan.  Mr. Pal has rightly pointed out that taxing statute requires strict interpretations and has cited <strong><em>Russell (Inspector of Taxes) Vs. Scott. 1948 A.C. 422, and Davigdor Goldsmid Vs. Inland Revenue Commissioners 1953 A.C. 347.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">16. We find it difficult to accept the con­tention of Mr. A.W.  Chowdhury. Apart from the fact that strict interpretation should be given to taxing statute, Mr. Asrarul Hossain has appropriately pointed out that the change of language appearing in clause (Via) relating to additional depreciation even before the amendment gives a clear indication of the in­tention of the Legislature.  In clause (Via) the word ‘in Pakistan’ are to be found but not in clause (VI). The Legislature in the same section has employed different language in two clauses. The ordinary rule of interpretation that change of language represents expression of different intentions is applicable. There is nothing in the context to hold to the contrary. The reason is weighty and requires no further discussion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">17. Mr. Asrarul Hossain has rightly po­inted   out   with   reference   to the decision of <strong><em>Income Tax, Madras Vs. Mir Mohammad Ali 1964 (53) ITR, 165</em></strong>, that the word ‘installed’ has been interpreted, with reference to substantially the same language of the Indian Act with the present one, to mean inducted or introduced or to place an apparatus in ser­vice or use. The question in that case was whe­ther the fixing of diesel engine in motor bus in place of petrol engine could be said to be installed. Holding it  to be so, it was observed that the expression ‘installed’ did not neces­sarily mean fixed in position but also mean used in the sense of inducted or introduced or to place an apparatus in position for service or use. On this analogy we can very well say that  introducing  a ship  for the first time for commercial use means ‘installed’ by assessee in the year of assessment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">18. Mr. A.W. Chowdhury has further sought to argue that the present appeals are not covered by the authority of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in United Netherland Navigation Co. Ltd. case. It is true the ques­tion involved in that decision was whether a foreign Company can claim allowance of unabsorbed depreciation in terms of s. 10(2) (vi) proviso (b) The Supreme Court held that the Revenue could under rule 33 assess of foreign company under any one of the three alternative methods provided therein. But if the Revenue chooses to follow the second method, then it should treat the assessee as a national company allowing all unabsorbed depreciation to the assessee.  The relevant pas­sage may be quoted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Our answer to the question re­ferred is that in computing total profits under the second method mentioned in rule 33 all unabsorbed depreciation has to be allowed and after profits are thus computed the proportion of total receipts against Pakistan receipts has to be applied to determine the profits for Pakistan.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">19. The Supreme Court decided the ques­tion in a manner as to embrace the present point under consideration. The Revenue in the instant case followed the second method of rule 33. The assessee could claim initial de­preciation unless there is anything contrary in the Act. We do not find any statutory bar to a foreign assessee’s claim in that regard. Hence the Tribunal was right in so far it allo­wed the three assessees’ initial depreciation under s. 10(2)(vi) of the Act. We find no reason to interfere. All the three appeals are dismissed with costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Source: 1976, (AD)</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><strong>The Community in transition related t</strong><strong>he Biharis of </strong><strong>Bangladesh</strong><strong>.</strong></p><h6><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract </span></h6><p>A relatively large number of Pakistanis known as the Bihari community have been stranded in Bangladesh since its independence in 1971. This community which supposed to be repatriated to Pakistan, has been vacillating between hope and despair because of the hopeless repatriation politics existing today. The objective of this paper is to analyze the status of the Bihari people and their socio-political problems in Bangladesh. This paper argues that the Bihari community suffers from identity crisis of being Bangladeshis and Pakistanis or being refugees and minorities that are deprived of fundamental rights. The unresolved repatriation problem is a consequence of deliberate procrastination and political indecision on the part of both Bangladesh and Pakistan governments. Neither of these governments have done much to resolve the problem of the Bihari community.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Bangladesh achieved independence from Pakistan in 1971. After independence, a considerable number of non-Bengali citizens in Bangladesh, known as the Biharis who opposed the independence of Bangladesh, wanted to go to Pakistan but could not do so due to complication in the repatriation process. These people are called “Stranded Pakistanis” or the Bihari Community.1 According to one report, the community is comprised of over 300,000 yet it is not recognized with a clearly defined identity.2 They have been living in 66 squalid camps with poor facilities scattered in several areas of Bangladesh for more than three decades.3 Although they are residing in “refugee camps,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) does not recognize them as refugees. Therefore, they are deprived of the benefits and opportunities extended to the refugees by the UNHCR. As a consequence, the stranded Biharis in Bangladesh face multiple problems.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to examine the status of the Bihari people in Bangladesh, highlight the sociopolitical impact of their statelessness, and analyze the diplomatic dilemma they have been facing over repatriation. The central thesis of the paper is that the Bihari community in Bangladesh is an ‘artificial minority’ because they are considered as a distinct group of people who are not part of Bangladesh, but yet living there as unwanted refugees. The unresolved status of the Biharis is a result of deliberate procrastination and political indecision on the part of both Bangladesh and Pakistan. The analysis of the Biharis problem is divided into three following sections. The first section discusses the background to the Biharis’ problem and their political status in Bangladesh. The second section discusses the sociopolitical conditions of the Bihari community in Bangladesh. And finally, the third section discusses the diplomatic scuffle over the repatriation of the stranded Biharis.</p><p>Background to the Problem</p><p>During the Partition of British-India in 1947, around one million Urdu speaking Muslims from the present day Indian provinces of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan moved to East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh.4 Their movement to East Pakistan was due to a desire to escape from communal bloodshed and “to preserve their Islamic way of life.”5 They also saw <em>Hijrat </em>(migration) as an escape from the possibility of living in a Hindu majority India.6 To their disappointment, when they arrived in East Pakistan, leaving behind their possessions, their familiar environment and professions, they felt alienated in the new society in terms of language, customs, traditions and culture. Although speakers of Pakistan’s official language, Urdu, they found themselves as a minority in the majority Bengali-speaking East Pakistan. These differences resulted in the Biharis identifying with West Pakistan whose dominance over the Pakistani state assured them of receiving greater privileges from the Central Government. While Bengalis were overwhelmingly employed in the agricultural sector, the Biharis, as full citizens of Pakistan, came to be involved in the industrial sector, small business, trade and commerce.7</p><p>The Bihari community never assimilated with the local people and maintained alliance with the West Pakistani regime against the interest of the Bengali people. They supported the adoption of Urdu as the official language in East Pakistan, where the language of the majority was Bengali, and opposed the Bengalis’ language movement in 1952. They also supported the issues of United Pakistan in the national and provincial elections in 1970.8 During 1971 Bangladeshi war of independence, the Biharis as Urdu-speaking people of non-Bengali origin, collaborated with the West Pakistani regime and opposed the Bengalis’ freedom struggle. When Bangladesh finally achieved independence, Bihari people wanted to go to West Pakistan, but could not do so immediately due to complication in repatriation process. This situation left them stranded in Bangladesh. They were promised of repatriation to Pakistan, but this promise was never fully materialized.</p><p>Identity of the Biharis in Bangladesh</p><p>The stranded Biharis in Bangladesh suffer from identity crisis. In Bangladesh they are viewed as ‘foreign’ (Pakistanis) that are stranded. They have been temporarily accommodated in “refugee camps,” but they are not regarded as refugees in the conventional sense. According to the Article 6(A) (1) of the Statute of UNHCR and Article 1(A) (2) of the Refugee Convention 1951, a “refugee” is a person who belongs to the following three criteria:</p><p>(a) the person is outside the country of his nationality, or in the case of stateless persons, outside the country of habitual residence;</p><p>(b) the person lacks natural protection; and</p><p>(c) the person fears persecution.</p><p>All these three criteria are apparently applicable to the Biharis in Bangladesh. However, according to the cessation clauses of the 1951 Convention and the UNHCR Statutes of 1950, a person shall stop being a refugee if, among others:</p><p>(1) h/she has voluntarily re-established him/herself in the country which h/she left or outside which h/she remained owing to fear of persecution,</p><p>The case of the Bihari Muslims is convered by this clause. Because, firstly, they voluntarily migrated to East Pakistan in 1947 from India; and secondly, in Pakistan they enjoyed protection by the state and were full-fledged citizens after 195110 according to Section 3(d) of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, which reads:</p><p>At the commencement of this Act every person shall be deemed to be a citizen of Pakistan who before the commencement of this Act migrated to the territories now included in Pakistan from any territory in the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent outside those territories with the intention of residing permanently in those territories.</p><p>Therefore, the case of the Biharis was not considered a refugee situation after the partition of 1947, as they were rehabilitated and naturalized in their newly demarcated territories.</p><p>The question of the Biharis’ becoming “refugees” had arisen once Bangladesh became separate from Pakistan. All of a sudden these people became stateless as they identified themselves as Pakistanis. But on the one hand, they were not refugees as they were not displaced from their place of residence, and on the other hand, they were stranded outside of their country where their status remained unrecognized. These complexities have given rendered the Biharis in Bangladesh a peculiar status, which can be called “artificial minority.”</p><p>The term “artificial minority” requires an elaboration on the concept of minority first. The term “minority” is defined in a number of ways. According to the <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</em>, a minority is an ethnic, religious, or other group having a distinctive presence with little power or representation relative to other groups within a society.</p><p>In municipal and international legal systems, “minority” denotes a particular meaning. The term “minority” was first legally defined by the Sub Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in 1977 in Article 27 of International Covenant of Civil &amp; Political Rights (ICCPR) of 1966. The article notes:</p><p>Minorities are considered to be a group numerically inferior to the rest of the population of the state, in a non-dominant position, whose members being citizens of a state, possess ethnic beliefs or linguistic characteristics differing from the rest of the population and show if only implicitly, a sense of solidarity directly towards preserving their culture, traditions, religions or language.</p><p>According to this definition, the protection of minorities is linked to the criteria of citizenship/nationality, which is usually supported by legal definitions in charters and covenants.</p><p>According to the Council of European Commission for Democracy Through Law (CDL) a minority is:</p><p>A group which is smaller in number than the rest of the population of a State, whose members have ethnic, religious or linguistic features different from those of the rest of the population, and are guided, if only implicitly, by the will to safeguard their culture, traditions, religion or language. Any group coming within the terms of this definition shall be treated as an ethnic, religious or linguistic minority.</p><p>In this definition, the requirement of citizenship has been omitted because citizenship should not be a requirement for basic human rights.</p><p>Analysis of these definitions shows that the term “minority” is a combination of five elements: (1) number, (2) subordinate status, (3) ethnic or religious or linguistic traits, (4) a will/wish to safeguard or preserve or strengthen the patterns of lifestyle, and (5) in some cases citizenship. The most acceptable of these definitions is that minority people, who are in a subordinate position due to their numbers, have to be different by “ethnic or religious or linguistic traits” from the majority people.14 In the context of the definition of national minority, the Swedish-speaking Finns are the largest linguistic minority in Finland, the Jews are a religious minority in Germany, and South Asians, Chinese and African blacks are ethnic minorities in the United States. In Austria, the Roma are an ethnic minority group, and Asian and West Indians are racial minorities in London. 15 In this way, minority groups in different countries can be identified in multiple ways, but in all cases, these minority groups are part of the larger national identity.</p><p>Bengalis form the majority ethnic group in Bangladesh with 85 per cent of the total population. There are also a number of ethnic groups that are considered ethnic minorities. These minority groups are Chakma, Marma, Rakhain, Kol, Vil, and Shaontal. They are ethnically different from the majority Bengalis. They usually live in a particular geographical location (mountainous areas) and maintain their distinct ways of life, culture, religion, language, traditional customs and values. Together they constitute about 15 per cent of the total population. Apart from ethnic identity, religious denomination is also applied to identify minority status. Accordingly, there are various religious minorities in Bangladesh such as Hindus (10.5 per cent), Christians (0.32 per cent) and Buddhists (0.59 per cent).16</p><p>The Bihari community in Bangladesh also has the minority characteristics outlined in the definitions provided earlier. They are ethnically different as they speak in different language. Internally they maintain Bihari cultural values in social life. Due to these characteristics, they maintain a different ethnic identity despite practicing the religion of the Bengali majority. Yet, the Bihari community in Bangladesh is not considered a minority group. The Biharis have been given a peculiar status which is “artificial,” that makes them neither refugees nor minorities. It is artificial because it is a product of an historical legacy of 1947, and of a political context of 1971, which made them live in artificially designated areas (camps) under international agreement. Yet they are literally a “minority” because they are insignificant in number. This arrangement separated them from the rest of the society and gave them an artificial identity.</p><p>As noted earlier, due to their crisis of identity, the Bihari people are deprived of both citizenship privileges as well as refugee benefits from the international community. The consequence is that they have to shoulder the impact of this unwanted and unresolved identity in their social, political and economic life.</p><p><strong>Social, Economic and Political Conditions of the Stranded Biharis </strong></p><p>The ethnic identity <em>Bihari </em>has a derogatory meaning in Bangladesh. Since the Biharis are believed to have opposed the independence of Bangladesh, and have collaborated with the Pakistani government in 1971 in the killing of Bengalis, they had to bear enormous social, economic and political consequences immediately after the independence of Bangladesh.</p><h5><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population </span></strong></h5><p>Overpopulation and population density are two primary problems in the refugee camps. Since 1971 the community people has almost doubled in number due to high birth rate in the camps.17 According to a survey report in 1992, the demographic figure of this community was 238,093 in 66 different camps throughout Bangladesh (Table 1). The number of residents has farther risen over time and that created extreme population density, as the number of camps remained unchanged since their construction in 1972.18 Presently, it is reported that the demographic figure is approximately 300,000 people.19 However, no proper survey has been done recently. The following map shows the geographical distribution of the Bihari camps in Bangladesh. The living conditions in these overcrowded camps are very squalid. Families of seven to ten members share a small eight by ten feet living space.20 Being frustrated with the camp life, sometimes the Bihari people escape from the camp and try to integrate themselves within the local community. Among them, very few are fortunate enough to survive and ultimately become able to give their children education. In most cases, they fail to survive by themselves and eventually return to the camps due to their inability to adjust to the social and economic conditions</p><p>Table 1</p><p><strong>List of Bihari Camps and their Population in </strong><strong>Bangladesh</strong><strong> </strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="178">area</td><td valign="top" width="84">No.   of families</td><td valign="top" width="84">No.   of Persons</td><td valign="top" width="84">area</td><td valign="top" width="84">No.   of families</td><td valign="top" width="84">No.   of Persons</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="178">Dhaka<p>Narayanganj</p><p>Syedpur</p><p>Rangpur</p><p>Chittagong</p><p>Dinajpur</p><p>Khalishpur</p><p>Jessore</p><p>Mymensingh</p><p>Faridpur</p><p>Rajbari</p></td><td valign="top" width="84">12,918<p>1,452</p><p>9,017</p><p>2,538</p><p>2,652</p><p>1,542</p><p>2,382</p><p>985</p><p>435</p><p>104</p><p>53</p></td><td valign="top" width="84">69,767<p>7,289</p><p>69,234</p><p>15,879</p><p>17,302</p><p>9,906</p><p>12,394</p><p>5,539</p><p>2,583</p><p>557</p><p>287</p></td><td valign="top" width="84">Thakurgaon<p>Nilphamari</p><p>Parbotipur</p><p>Dhaka (outside camp)</p><p>Dewanganj</p><p>Rajshahi</p><p>Khulna</p><p>Bogra</p><p>Gaibandha</p></td><td valign="top" width="84">NA<p>NA</p><p>271</p><p>1,207</p><p>109</p><p>1,185</p><p>1,029</p><p>898</p><p>129</p></td><td valign="top" width="84">NA<p>NA</p><p>1,632</p><p>7,763</p><p>578</p><p>6,829</p><p>5,864</p><p>5,319</p><p>788</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="166"><strong>Total </strong></td><td colspan="6" valign="top" width="430"><strong>No. of Families: 40,357 No. of Persons: 238,093 </strong></td></tr><tr height="0"><td width="165"></td><td width="12"></td><td width="83"></td><td width="83"></td><td width="86"></td><td width="83"></td><td width="83"></td></tr></tbody></table><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health and Sanitation </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h1><p>The living environment of the camps is very deplorable. It is unhealthy, dirty, damp and un-hygienic. The camp authorities are neither able nor serious to maintain a healthy sanitation facility. The drainage system is extremely poor, which causes water logging very easily. Therefore, contagious diseases especially diarrhea and dengue are very common. This condition exists in other camps throughout the country. The municipalities/City Corporation cleaners never enter the camps to clear the garbage. It is only when the camp-dwellers drop their garbage in the dustbins outside the camp, that the City Corporation cleaners will take them out. In addition, the entire camp people share a few common bathrooms and toilets, which are very few compared to the number of people (Table 2).</p><p>Table 2</p><p><strong>Sanitation in </strong><em><strong>Geneva</strong></em><strong><em> Camp </em></strong><strong>in June 2003 </strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="170"><strong>Block A </strong></td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="92"><strong>Block B</strong></td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="92"><strong>Block C</strong></td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="92"><strong>Block D</strong></td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="92"><strong>Block E </strong></td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="56"><strong>Total</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="157">Toilets</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">69</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">68</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">4</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">67</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">65</td><td valign="top" width="43">273</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="157">Toilets with Shade</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">8</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">10</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">2</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">8</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">8</td><td valign="top" width="43">36</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="157">Toilets out of order</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">1 Shade</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">Nil</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">Nil</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">2 Shades</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">Nil</td><td valign="top" width="43">3 Shades</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="157">Bathrooms</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">8</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">12</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">2</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">8</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">6</td><td valign="top" width="43">36</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="157">Bathrooms without Roof</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">8</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">9</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">2</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">7</td><td colspan="2" valign="top" width="79">5</td><td valign="top" width="43">31</td></tr><tr height="0"><td width="152"></td><td width="13"></td><td width="65"></td><td width="26"></td><td width="51"></td><td width="38"></td><td width="39"></td><td width="52"></td><td width="26"></td><td width="64"></td><td width="13"></td><td width="58"></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Source: </em>Author’s personal fieldwork in September-November 2002.</p><p>According to a recent survey report of <em>Refugees International, </em>in Rangpur City (in the northwestern part of Bangladesh), there are only two working wells and ten latrines for the 5,000 residents of Camp Three. The situation is even worse in Mirpur’s Millat Camp, where there is only one latrine for 6,000 people.22 Most of the time they need to queue to get their turn. Furthermore, both male and female alike share the same facility, which creates problems for the females. There is no privacy for the females either in toilet or shower facilities. At night, when young ladies need to visit toilet, they take their parents or someone else as their guard. Most of the toilets are without shade, and people need to stand in line for their turn. In the shower rooms ladies sometimes have to wait for hours to take bath in groups of three or four.</p><p>Moreover, there is an acute scarcity of safe drinking water in every camp. Deep tube well is the main source of water in camps, but there is also acute shortage of tube well in every camp. For example, in Hatikhana camp (Saidpur) there are only 9 tube wells for 400 families. Therefore, people, like in Adamjee camps, need to collect water from the nearby ponds or walk a long distance to take water. So, water born diseases, such as cholera, typhoid and skin disease are endemic. Recently, some NGOs like Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (Kuwait), Concern, OBAT Helpers and others are helping them out to lessen this problem by distributing some tube wells, though those are inadequate to meet the demand of all residents.</p><p>Medical Care</p><p>There are about 25,000 people living in Mohammadpur Geneva Camp, which is considered the biggest camp and is comparatively in good position. There is only one medical clinic (Al-Falah Model Clinic) in the camp which is poorly equipped. A survey report on the Bihari camps in the city of Rangpur (in Northern part of Bangladesh) shows similar inadequate medical facility for them. Moreover, in some cases, camps like Adamji do not have a single medical clinic. As a result, infant mortality due to lack of medical care is quite common. The survey found that 60 percent of infants die before they reach their childhood. Three out of every five newborns die before reaching the age five. Likewise, inaccessibility to proper medical facilities make women vulnerable to unsafe delivery, chronic diseases like polio, Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) and other health problems. A lot of women die every year without getting proper medical care. As these people are very poor, they cannot afford to take medical facilities from other government and private institutions.</p><p>However, nowadays, some national and international organizations, such as, Dhaka Shishu (children) Hospital funded by Asia Development Bank (ADB), Worldvision Bangladesh and others periodically support the Bihari camp dwellers by providing free medical check up for few parts of the Dhaka based camps. So not all dwellers are benefiting from the few medical aid, as the number of people needing medical care is very large. Furthermore, being poor and uneducated these people are not aware of immunizing their children against most of the lethal and debilitating diseases such as measles, small-pox, DPT, and poliomyelitis. Majority of the people are not aware of family planning. The contraceptive prevalence has been found to be very low in them.</p><h4><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education </span></strong></h4><p>Recently, the Bangladesh government has taken an initiative to improve the rate of child literacy which is called “Reaching Out of School Children” (ROSC), a six-year long project to educate 5 hundred thousand deprived children by 2015.23 However, this project does not cover the Bihari children in the camps. The Bihari camps have almost no educational facilities. And even if there are schools, the poor people cannot afford to send their children to the school. In many cases, if Bihari families want to send their children to school outside the camps, they fail to enroll because of some technical requirements such as nationality, home address or parents’ occupation. Though some of them can manage to get enrolled, they find it very difficult to continue hiding these facts. In some cases, when the school authority comes to know that the student came from the camp, that student will be immediately dismissed. In a few cases, those who are studying outside their community school are basically continuing to hide their Bihari identity.24</p><p>The schooling facility inside the camps is extremely inadequate. There are a total of 55 thousand families in various camps throughout the country. This means that average number of members in a family is five. The current number of schools in the camps across the country is 500. It is reported that only one per cent of the Bihari children attends school, which reflects the high rate of illiteracy in the camps. These people are not getting any kind of assistance from the government for their children to get education. It is totally dependent upon the parents’ ability. But as the people are very poor in terms of economic condition, they are not able to afford that.</p><p>In the Mohammadpur Camp, there is only one school named Non Local Junior High School, established in 1974. The school is from Kindergarten to level eight. The school has only ten teachers, one cleaner and one clerk. The headmaster of this school, Showkat Ali, admitted that in 1993-94 there were around 450 students in the school but the number decreased to only about 150 in 2003.25 The headmaster complained that there is a tendency to decrease the number of students in upper classes and the teachers are not paid regularly. Tuition fees for different classes are 40 to 80 taka (Bangladesh currency)26 per month which is very high for the parents to pay. There is no financial assistance for the students from the government. Recently, some NGOs such as Social and Economic Enhancement Program (SEEP) have provided free education for some students up to class three in primary school. The rest of the school age children do not get this opportunity.</p><p><strong> Life in Camps</strong></p><h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic Life </span></strong></h2><p>The economic condition of the Bihari people is extremely poor because of financial insecurity. During the initial years they were mainly dependent on the relief economy, but over the years the amount of relief has decreased significantly. It is reported that the Bangladesh government used to spend about US$ 250,000 a month to provide basic needs for them which is very inadequate. However, recently this support is significantly reduced and in some cases stopped. For example, there was a monthly distribution of relief materials provided by the government in Bihari camps, but this program has been postponed in most of the camps. In the camps, where the program is still going on, such as Adamjee camps in Narayanganj and five out of twenty-two camps in Saidpur do not get the officially approved ration of 3.23 Kg wheat rather 2.5 Kg and the distribution is also very irregular. In addition, nongovernmental organizations also provide food aid. For instance, the Bangladesh Red Crescent gives a small amount of food aid to each family. Yet, it is reported that this food aid is inadequate against the demand.27</p><p>Secondly, people in the camps are confined to the camp boundary and do not own any land outside the camps.28 As the economy of the country is basically agro-based, land ownership is very important. But the Bihari people have no ownership of fixed properties such as land and ponds. The economic condition of the camps located outside Dhaka area is particularly adverse because the opportunity of getting employed in agricultural activities is limited. People in those camps are involved in various activities within the camp boundary. Whereas the camp dwellers in Dhaka city can sometimes get work on daily basis such as rickshaw pullers and construction workers though they often face discrimination and harassment. In an interview with <em>Refugees International</em>, one young rickshaw puller in Dhaka said that he earns 100 taka a day. After the end of the day, he pays 40 taka to the owner and the rest 60 taka (about $1.00) is his earning to feed his family.29</p><p>Most Biharis work as daily wage laborers. The Biharis at Millat Camp in Mirpur are working as barbers, sari-makers or doing other petty jobs. Large numbers of them are engaged in producing Benarasi Saree.30 However, recently their saree industries have been losing markets because of the large inflow of imported goods. Besides, the anti-social elements such as rent-seekers from the Bengali community as well as Bihari community often harass them for economic reasons.</p><p>There is little economic opportunity for the Biharis in or outside the camps. Jobs in Bangladesh are scarce, and loans for small business supplies like looms and cloth are virtually nonexistent. Those who manage to start business must combat the rampant crime in the camps, both at the hands of fellow Biharis and local Bengalis, who resent the Biharis for ethnic and political reasons. Arson is a weapon of choice of those targeting the camps, and fires spread like monsoon floods devouring homes and lives.31</p><p>A good number of old people have turned to begging and an estimated 20,000 unmarried girls are vulnerable to human trafficking and forced prostitution for living.32 The camp areas serve as safe havens for many criminals, and as a consequence many camp dwellers are directly involved in various criminal activities to earn their livelihood.</p><h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></h2><h2><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Internal Political Life </span></strong></h2><p>The political life of the stranded Bihari people is also ripped apart by internal political squabbles and factionalism. The political factionalism of the Biharis is as a result of divided loyalties of either supporting or opposing the view of becoming Bangladeshi citizens or going back to Pakistan. The older generation that held the view of returning to Pakistan still dominates the community and tries to persuade the community to support their view. Mr. Alhaj M. Nasim Khan is the leader of the Urdu speaking camp-dwellers all across Bangladesh.33 He is the chief of <em>Stranded Pakistani General Repatriation Camp </em>(SPGRC), which had been established on 2nd December 1977 with the aim of being repatriated to Pakistan one day. The SPGRC Chief organized many demonstrations, hunger strikes and met the Pakistani high officials including heads of the state several times in order to put pressure on Pakistan. But as he failed in many bids to negotiate with both governments of Pakistan and Bangladesh, and as the whole process of repatriation has got sidelined, his popularity decreased. Moreover, in the present time, there is controversy about the leadership of Nasim Khan. Many of the Biharis believe that when the SPGRC was established, there were no influential leaders to represent this Bihari people. At that time, Nasim Khan claimed to be the leader of this organization and is continuing up to this time, as in their society there is no other system to change this.34 Even some Geneva Camp community people complained that Nasim Khan is no longer physically able to lead this community as he has become very old and sick. His son deputizes for him whenever he is sick.</p><p>As a result, it is now evident that some Bihari people have established a new frontier, <em>The Committee for Rehabilitation of Non-Bengalis </em>with different objectives. The main supporters of this group are basically young people who considered themselves as Bangladeshis though they are poor and passing a very inhuman life in camps.35 They do not want to be repatriated to Pakistan. One representative of the Stranded Pakistanis Youth Repatriation Movement (SPYRM) states that, “By virtue of birth, we are Bangladeshi citizens and we want to live in this country with equal status enjoyed by the Bengali-speaking Bangladeshis.”36 Another report on the survey of 51 households in Mohammadpur Geneva Camp, Tejgaon Camp and Mirpur Camp, conducted by Refugees and Migratory Movements Research Unit (RMMRU) in 1993, shows that 59 per cent of Bihari people have identified themselves as Bangladeshi and wanted to get the citizenship of Bangladesh, whereas 35 per cent wanted to go to Pakistan. The rest 6 per cent did not comment on this issue.</p><p>Source: prepared by author based on <em>UDBASTU </em>(Uprooted), Issue 4, April-June, 1998.</p><p>Now many of them want a different leadership. They opposed the old leader’s dream – to be relocated to Pakistan one day. As the young generation has never set foot on their so-called homeland of Pakistan, to them Bangladesh is their home.37 They demand Bangladeshi citizenship.38 An example of this demand is a petition made to the High Court by a group of four women and six men claiming their citizenship rights. The High Court, in August 2003, declared them citizens of Bangladesh by birth and ruled in favor of their voting rights.39 However, the Bangladesh government is reluctant to abide by the High Court verdict.</p><p>The Politics of Bihari Repatriation</p><p>In 1972-73, Bangladesh offered the Biharis two options either to stay in Bangladesh as citizens or return to Pakistan through repatriation process handled by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Two thirds of the Bihari people opted to return to Pakistan through ICRC as they wanted avoid an uncertain future. But from the very beginning, Pakistan was reluctant to receive this large number of Biharis.</p><p>One year after the independence of Bangladesh, the unmanageable situation of the Biharis led the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to bring the issue before the UN and requested the Secretary General Kurt Waldheim to extend his help to ensure the repatriation of the stranded people. But the Bhutto government, from the very beginning, was reluctant to repatriate the Urdu-speaking Biharis due to domestic resistance and political consideration.</p><p>In 1973, the UNHCR became involved in this issue and took practical initiatives which were called a “repatriation program.” The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also worked side by side with the UNHCR. They gathered these people in different camps for their safety and registered them for possible repatriation to Pakistan.</p><p>The Simla accord of July 1972 normalized the relationship between India and Pakistan which eventually allowed New Delhi to take the initiative of influencing Dhaka to settle the trilateral problems between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Subsequently, the two governments of Pakistan and India, with the agreement of the government of Bangladesh, signed the New Delhi Agreement on 28 August 1973.40 In the immediate aftermath of the accord, several phases of repatriation took place. From 1973 to April 1974, with the help of International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) around 170,000 Bihari people were repatriated to Pakistan for the first time.After the initial repatriation, Pakistan expressed reluctance to accept more liability for the large number of remaining stranded Biharis for repatriation. In June 1974, during the Mujib-Bhutto talks in Bangladesh, Mujib requested Bhutto to take back immediately all stranded people who opted to return to Pakistan. But Bhutto refused to take the responsibility by saying “I have not come to Bangladesh with a blank cheque.”42 Due to economic pressure, Mujib took the case seriously and raised the issue in the Third World Committee of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in December 1974 and Commonwealth leader’s conference in Jamaica in May 1975. But his diplomatic initiative did not come with any positive result. Moreover, the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975 slowed down the repatriation diplomacy further.</p><p>After the Mujib regime, the military government of General Ziaur Rahman restarted diplomatic efforts with his Pakistani counterpart to solve the issue of stranded Bihari people. Following his43 Hafiz (1985: 369).</p><p>44 Haider (2003: 534).</p><p>45 Ennals (1987: 243).</p><p>46 Chowdhury (1992: 301).</p><p>47 The Daily Ittefaq, 2  January 1985.</p><p>48 Haider (2003: 535).</p><p>Pakistan visit in 1977, Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary visited Dhaka and agreed to take 25,000 “hardship cases” through the international agencies. Subsequently, 4,790 people out of 25,000 were repatriated.43 But the whole process was stopped again because of Pakistan’s internal political instability.</p><p>In July 1978, Bangladesh Foreign Secretary visited Pakistan and urged the officials to reactivate the repatriation process. But this time, the Pakistani government reduced the number of Biharis from 25,000 to 16,000.44 With the help of UNHCR, another 2800 Biharis had been repatriated in September 1979. It was financed by Saudi Arabia and Libya. During this time, a former British Parliament Member (MP) Lord Ennals played a very important role in solving this situation of these stranded people. In 1980, he met President Zia of Bangladesh and President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan which resulted in eventual repatriation of another 7,000 people.45</p><p>Later, with the initiative of Lord Ennals, the Geneva based International Council of Voluntary Agencies organized a conference in Geneva in December 1982 which is commonly known as the Geneva Conference.46 During the conference, twelve different national and international organizations from different countries including Bangladesh had attended except Pakistan. In this conference, the stranded Pakistani people expressed their strong desire to be repatriated to Pakistan. Consequently, Lord Ennals established an international resettlement trust to finance the resettlement procedure of the Biharis.</p><p>After a series of different diplomatic initiatives a an important development took place in 1983 when President Zia-ul-Haq publicly announced in Karachi that Pakistan would not have any reservations about the repatriation of stranded Bihari people from Bangladesh, if the necessary fund were provided by donors. Then Foreign Minister of Pakistan paid an official visit to Dhaka and said after the conference that Pakistan was thinking about taking 50,000 more Biharis according to the second Delhi Agreement. In the meantime, with the financial support of Lord Ennal’s Resettlement Trust 6,000 Biharis were repatriated and resettled in Lahore in 1984. But Pakistan’s slow progress broke the patience of Bangladesh again. Therefore, once again Bangladesh raised the issue in the Islamic Countries Foreign Ministers’ Conference (ICFM) in Sana, requesting them to put pressure on Pakistan to take back its people from Bangladesh to Pakistan.47 But that diplomatic effort did not work well. Rather, in December 1985, President Zia-ul-Haq during his visit to Dhaka told a delegation of the stranded Biharis that Pakistan had already “fulfilled its legal obligation under the agreement signed in 1973 and further repatriation would only depend on the availability of huge resources required.”</p><p>In this situation, Pakistan government signed an agreement with Saudi based Humanitarian organization <em>Rabita Al-Alam-Al-Islam </em>(RAAI), in July, 1986. Later, they established a trust, named <em>Rabita Trust Deed, </em>and appointed President Zia-ul-Haq as Chairman to mobilize funds for the repatriation of the remaining 250,000 stranded Pakistanis from Bangladesh. Initially the Pakistan Government donated RS. 250 million while the RAAI contributed RS. 50 million. The expectation was that the remaining required expenditure would be collected within three years and the repatriation would start immediately after that. Unfortunately, the whole process became stuck again with the sudden death of President Zia-ul-Haq in 1988. Later, the Committee of the Trust was re-established in August 1989, with Mr. Yakub Khan as its chairman, but it could not achieve any remarkable success.</p><p>Benazir Bhutto, after becoming Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1988 soon faced some difficulties in resolving the issue of repatriation because of serious domestic challenges from her home</p><p>49 Kaushik (1994: 196).</p><p>50 The Pakistan Times, 18  January 1989.</p><p>51 The Muslim, 23  January 1989.</p><p>52 PM Nawaz Sharif and PM Khaleda Zia signed an accord on August 10, 1992 at Islamabad, to hasten the process of repatriation and to solve the problem of sharing of assets and liabilities.</p><p>53 Kaushik (1994: 209).</p><p>province of Sind, where Biharis were supposed to be repatriated.49 Though she promised to take immediate effective steps but that assurance proved ineffective.</p><p>At the beginning of 1989, under the joint initiatives taken by the UNHCR and RAAI, the government of Pakistan agreed to repatriate the first batch of 500 Biharis from Bangladesh.50 But at the same time, the Foreign Ministry of Pakistan explained that the collected money under the <em>Rabita Trust Deed </em>was only Rs. 300 million which was not sufficient for the total repatriation program.51 In addition to that, the Senate’s adoption of a delay motion on the issue contributed to the further delay the repatriation process.</p><p>The Benazir government was under heavy pressure from various Sindhi nationalist organizations such as the Sindh National Alliance, the Awami National Party, the Sindh Student Federation and the Democratic Students’ Federation to oppose the process of repatriation of Biharis. The opposition leader, the Chief Minister of Punjab, Nawaz Sharif took advantage of Benazir’s dilemma. All these factors influenced the Benazir’s government. So, during her Dhaka visit in 1989, she subtly avoided the stranded Pakistani issue by labeling it as a very complex problem. Afterwards, domestic political development in the respective countries hampered the progress of repatriation.</p><p>The settlement of Bihari issue proved to be more complex during PM Nawaz Sharif’s regime. Despite domestic opposition, Nawaz Sharif speeded up the process of repatriation within a year of taking over power. In this line, the <em>Rabita Trust Board </em>(RTB), under the chairmanship of Nawaz Sharif established three committees on November 11, 1991 to accelerate the repatriation process. It agreed that initially a batch of 325 Biharis of 63 families would be repatriated to start the “symbolic repatriation” by December 31, 1992 and subsequently, repatriation would take place phase by phase as funds became available. He gave the assurance that the August 1992 accord would be implemented and that an average of 8,000 repatriates would be settled in every district of Punjab.52</p><p>However, because of the increasing domestic protests against the repatriation the government of Pakistan could not keep the word to start “symbolic repatriation” by December 13, 1992. In addition to that, the Pakistan High Commission in Dhaka informed the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry on December 28, 1992 that because of extensive floods in the Punjab province, the process of repatriation would be suspended until January of the following year. The Punjab Chief Minister also postponed his earlier scheduled visit to Bangladesh. Subsequently, a “symbolic repatriation” took place from Adamjee camp with the help of <em>Rabita Al-Alam-Al-Islam </em>on January 10, 1993. At this time, a small group of 325 Biharis were repatriated to Pakistan after a long wait. Conversely, “the symbolic repatriation was only the tip of the proverbial iceberg.”53 But this process was soon stopped due to the dismissal of Nawaz Sharif government in 1993.</p><p>The process of repatriation further suffered a serious set back because of Mrs. Butto’s hard-line attitude during her second term in office. From the unhappy experience of Mrs. Bhutto’s earlier tenure, the stranded Bihari community became deeply suspicious about the sincerity of Pakistan over early repatriation. The issue remained undecided during the second term of Nawaz Sharif in office, and it stopped making any progress at all after General Pervez Musharraf came to power.</p><p>From the above scenario, it is clear that immediately after the 1971 war and in the three decades that followed, Pakistan was under pressure to take these people back. Pakistan took back a substantial number of people, but gradually its moral obligations became weakened because of 16</p><p>domestic political protests, the emphasis on other foreign policy issues, and above all, the unwillingness to take responsibility for these people. All these different political realities motivated Pakistan to change its decisions. Therefore, no repatriation took place from 1993 up to the present time. The following graph shows the picture of repatriation at a glance.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>This paper examined the status of the stranded Bihari people in Bangladesh, highlighted the impact of the stranded status of the Biharis with regards to their socioeconomic and political life, and analyzed diplomatic disputes over their repatriation to Pakistan. Through the analysis it is obvious that the stranded Bihari community in Bangladesh falls under no conventional identity, or category of international standard. They cannot be called refugees because they were not displaced from their homeland in the first place during 1971 war of independence for Bangladesh. They cannot be regarded as minority because they do not constitute a part of the Bangladeshi nation. Yet, they are outside their country, Pakistan, and they are relatively small in number with a distinct identity in Bangladesh. Their peculiar status proves that the conventional definitions of the terms ‘refugee’ and ‘minority’ have limitations in describing the Biharis in Bangladesh. In such precarious situations international laws or international bodies proved to be ineffective either in extending humanitarian assistance or in the mediation efforts to solve the problem.</p><p>This paper argued that the issue being exclusively bilateral between Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the ways both the countries have dealt with it, the Biharis have taken on an identity, which might be termed as “artificial minority.” Evidently, conditions of the stranded Bihari people are due to the domestic sensitivities of both Bangladesh and Pakistan which are hindering either their naturalization in Bangladesh or repatriation to Pakistan. The socioeconomic and political impact of the Biharis, stranded for a long period of time, is certainly enormous. It makes the future of these population uncertain, creates economic pressure, social insecurity and political sensitivities in the host country. The situation calls for an immediate attention of the two concerned countries as well as of international communities to find out practical solutions to the problem.</p><p><strong>References </strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Books </span></strong></p><p>Ahmed, A.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Community in Transition- The Biharis of </strong><strong>Bangladesh</strong><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this research is to examine the status of the Bihari people in Bangladesh, emphasize the sociopolitical impact of their statelessness, and analyze the diplomatic problem they have been facing over repatriation. The central notion of the paper is that the Bihari community in Bangladesh is an ‘artificial minority’ because they are considered as a distinct group of people who are not part of Bangladesh, but yet living there as unwanted refugees. The unresolved status of the Biharis is a result of deliberate delay and political indecision on the part of both Bangladesh and Pakistan. The analysis of the Biharis problem is divided into four following sections. The first section discusses the brief story of Biharis and their origin written in the introduction, secondly comes the background to the Biharis’ problem and their current status i.e. economic and social status in Bangladesh. The third section discusses the sociopolitical conditions of the Bihari community in Bangladesh. And finally, the fourth section discusses the diplomatic fight over the repatriation of the abandoned Biharis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The history of the Bihari refugees goes back to the partition of India in 1947. Their displacement occurred in the awaken of public violence during and in the aftermath of the partition (for example, 30,000 Muslims were killed in the ‘Great Bihar Killing’ in October-November 1947). About a million of them migrated to the eastern part of Pakistan (East Pakistan now Bangladesh) mostly from the eastern Indian states of Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the period of united Pakistan (1947-1971), the Urdu-speaking Biharis were not incorporated with in the society of East Pakistan and remained as a distinct cultural-linguistic group. They generally associated and identified themselves with the West Pakistani society because of their cultural similarity and shared linguistic heritage. They supported the West Pakistani governing leaders in the process of capturing the economic and political power in East  Pakistan. The Biharis, consequently, enjoyed government patronage and preferential treatment in various sectors of the East Pakistan economy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Initially the arrival of Biharis and the positive discrimination of the Pakistan Government in terms of refugee rehabilitation were not resented by the Bengalis. However, the excitement of the formation of Pakistan and the positive attitude of the Bengalis towards the Biharis was short-lived. It was over as early as March 1948 when Mohammad Ali Jinnah announced in Dhaka that “Urdu and Urdu alone shall be the State language of Pakistan.”<strong>1</strong> During the Language Movement, the Biharis instead of supporting the Bengalis, sided with the West Pakistani ruling elite. Further, in the 1954 provincial elections and in the 1970 general elections, they extended their support to the Muslim League, which symbolized and championed the domination of the West Pakistanis over the Bengalis. They also supported the West Pakistani ruling elite and many of them actively participated in the military actions against the Bengalis in the 1971 Bangladesh Independence War. The exclusive attitude of the Biharis and their pro-West Pakistani political activities culminated with the growth of an anti-Bihari sentiment among the Bengalis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><cite>1 </cite><cite><a href="http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/commentary/jinnah.html">www.virtualbangladesh.com/commentary/<strong>jinnah</strong>.html</a> (Reference)</cite></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><cite>2 </cite><cite><strong>Van Schendel (2009)</strong></cite><cite></cite></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Status</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic Status</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The economic condition of the Bihari people is extremely deprived because of financial insecurity. During the early years they were mainly dependent on the relief economy, but over the years the amount of relief has decreased significantly. It is reported that the Bangladesh government used to spend about US$ 250,000 a month to provide basic needs for them which is very inadequate. However, recently this support is significantly reduced and in some cases stopped. For example, there was a monthly distribution of relief materials provided by the government in Bihari camps, but this program has been postponed in most of the camps. In the camps, where the program is still going on, such as Adamjee camps in Narayanganj and five out of twenty-two camps in Saidpur do not get the officially approved ration of 3.23 Kg wheat rather 2.5 Kg and the distribution is also very irregular. In addition, nongovernmental organizations also provide food aid. For instance, the Bangladesh Red Crescent gives a small amount of food aid to each family. Yet, it is reported that this food aid is inadequate against the demand.<strong>3</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, people in the camps are confined to the camp boundary and do not own any land outside the camps.<strong>4</strong> As the economy of the country is basically agro-based, land ownership is very important. But the Bihari people have no ownership of fixed properties such as land and ponds. The economic condition of the camps located outside Dhaka area is particularly adverse because the opportunity of getting employed in agricultural activities is limited. People in those camps are involved in various activities within the camp boundary. Whereas the camp dwellers in Dhaka city can sometimes get work on daily basis such as rickshaw pullers and construction workers though they often face discrimination and harassment. In an interview with Refugees International, one young rickshaw puller in Dhaka said that he earns 100 taka a day. After the end of the day, he pays 40 taka to the owner and the rest 60 taka (about $1.00) is his earning to feed his family.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most Biharis work as daily wage laborers. The Biharis at Millat Camp in Mirpur are working as barbers, sari-makers or doing other petty jobs. Large numbers of them are engaged in producing Benarasi Saree.30 However, recently their saree industries have been losing markets because of the large inflow of imported goods. Besides, the anti-social elements such as rent-seekers from the Bengali community as well as Bihari community often harass them for economic reasons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is little economic opportunity for the Biharis in or outside the camps. Jobs in Bangladesh are scarce, and loans for small business supplies like looms and cloth are virtually nonexistent. Those who manage to start business must combat the rampant crime in the camps, both at the hands of fellow Biharis and local Bengalis, who resent the Biharis for ethnic and political reasons. Arson is a weapon of choice of those targeting the camps, and fires spread like monsoon floods devouring homes and lives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A good number of old people have turned to begging and an estimated 20,000 unmarried girls are vulnerable to human trafficking and forced prostitution for living.32 The camp areas serve as safe havens for many criminals, and as a consequence many camp dwellers are directly involved in various criminal activities to earn their livelihood.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><cite> </cite></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><cite> </cite></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">3 <strong>Khan (2003).</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">4 <strong>Though theses camps are not jail, people can go out and come into whenever they need. But denial from all basic facilities and the identity crisis keep them in an unsecured position. Moreover, a fresh start needs more money which is often time a big hindrance for them.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Social Status</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Biharis are considered as stateless as most have neither Bangladeshi nor Pakistani citizenship. As a result, they are denied basic political rights such as the right to vote and recruitment to the civil service, police, military, and political office. These political restrictions severely limit the group’s economic opportunities and continue to perpetuate their poverty and underrepresentation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most Biharis are still seeking repatriation to Pakistan but there is a growing minority that has resigned itself to living in Bangladesh and is thus seeking Bangladeshi citizenship. Economic concerns are also a major issue as their lack of citizenship restricts the types of employment they are able to obtain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Bihari camps have almost no educational facilities. And even if there are schools, the poor people cannot afford to send their children to the school. In many cases, if</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bihari families want to send their children to school outside the camps, they fail to enroll because of some technical requirements such as nationality, home address or parents’ occupation. Though some of them can manage to get enrolled, they find it very difficult to continue hiding these facts. In some cases, when the school authority comes to know that the student came from the camp, that student will be immediately dismissed. In a few cases, those who are studying outside their community school are basically continuing to hide their Bihari identity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The schooling facility inside the camps is extremely inadequate. There are a total of 55 thousand families in various camps throughout the country. This means that average number of members in a family is five. The current number of schools in the camps across the country is 500. It is reported that only one per cent of the Bihari children attends school, which reflects the high rate of illiteracy in the camps. These people are not getting any kind of assistance from the government for their children to get education. It is totally dependent upon the parents’ ability. But as the people are very poor in terms of economic condition, they are not able to afford that.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prior and Current Political Condition</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The political life of the stranded Bihari people split apart by internal political argument</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and factionalism. The political disturbance of the Biharis is as a result of divided loyalties of either supporting or opposing the view of becoming Bangladeshi citizens or going back to Pakistan. The older generation that held the view of returning to Pakistan still dominates the community and tries to persuade the community to support their view.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is now evident that some Bihari people have established a new frontier, <em>The</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Committee for Rehabilitation of Non-Bengalis </em>with different objectives. The main supporters of this group are basically young people who considered themselves as Bangladeshis though they are poor and passing a very inhuman life in camps.<strong>5</strong> They do not want to be repatriated to Pakistan. One representative of the Stranded Pakistanis Youth Repatriation Movement (SPYRM) states that, “By virtue of birth, we are Bangladeshi citizens and we want to live in this country with equal status enjoyed by the Bengali-speaking Bangladeshis.”<strong>6</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another report on the survey of 51 households in Mohammadpur Geneva Camp, Tejgaon Camp and Mirpur Camp, conducted by Refugees and Migratory Movements Research Unit (RMMRU) in 1993, shows that 59 per cent of Bihari people have identified themselves as Bangladeshi and wanted to get the citizenship of Bangladesh, whereas percent wanted to go to Pakistan. The rest 6 per cent did not comment on this issue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">5 <strong>The Daily </strong><strong><em>Manabjomin</em></strong><strong>, </strong><strong>17  January 2000</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">6 <strong> <cite><a href="http://www.scientificjournals.org/journals2008">www.scientificjournals.org/journals2008</a></cite></strong><cite></cite></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“<a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-33670220080520">This week the Bangladesh High Court ruled that Biharis born in the country after 1971 can be granted Bangladeshi citizenship</a>.<strong>7</strong> Refugees International welcomes this positive decision which, pending final signature, will grant Biharis, or Urdu-speaking people born after the time of independence in Bangladesh, the right to be registered as voters and to receive national identity cards. This measure will allow about half of the 200-500,000 stateless Biharis, hosted by Bangladesh for 36 years, to find a remedy to their lack of an effective nationality. The decision does not cover individuals who were adults at the time of independence.</p><p>RI has long advocated for action by the governments of Bangladesh and Pakistan to end this serious human rights abuse by granting citizenship and/or permitting repatriation. RI’s last mission to Bangladesh was in February 2006, when staff met with government officials and Bihari leaders to urge timely action. After the visit, U.S. Representative Diane Watson issued a letter to Assistant Secretary Ellen Sauerbrey, who was then the head of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, to press for resolution. RI president Kenneth Bacon and others requested the interim government to consider this group for inclusion in voter rolls and citizenship. <a href="http://http/www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/10175/">On September 5, 2007, the interim government issued a decision in that regard.</a>”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The earlier race of Biharis are considered as traitors because they directly and indirectly helped the Pakistan armies and contributed to 1971 massacre.<strong>8</strong> Not only Biharis many Muslim extremist also took part in this loathing activities. They wanted to turn East Pakistan to West Pakistan to aid their own intention. But it is good news for Biharies that new government is taking positive steps in their favor.<strong>9</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">7<strong> <a href="http://www.refugeesinternational.org/blog/bihari-statelessness-citizenship">http://www.refugeesinternational.org/blog/bihari-statelessness-citizenship</a></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">8<strong> Nirmolendu Goon (2009)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">9<strong> Rashid (2008)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This paper argued that the issue being exclusively bilateral between Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the ways both the countries have dealt with it, the Biharis have taken on an identity, which might be termed as “artificial minority.” highlighted the impact of the stranded status of the Biharis with regards to their socioeconomic and political life, and analyzed diplomatic disputes over their repatriation to Pakistan.

For 8 years, SPL has been producing chemicals in their chemical division.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SPL’s prime competitor BEXIMCO is enjoying a very good product image in the market. Their R/M source is also the same and moreover, they started producing chemicals before SPL started. But recently, the crisis of corruption in the company abates the image of BEXIMCO.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4.3 Highest Number of Products Among the pharmaceutical companies</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Among existing pharmaceutical companies SPL has the largest number of products and dosage forms.

But as the prime competitor BEXIMCO is maintaining a very good relationship with press, political parties, and business associates and can exert pressure on govt. authorities regarding policy making, now SPL has also started keep a good relationship with press and trying to build corporate image.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5.6 Strong Brand Image</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SPL is enjoying a strong brand image for some of its products, like Entacyd. Neotack, Cetamol, Civet etc. These products are well known in the pharmacy market.

The personality traits (like intelligence, social maturity, inner motivation &amp; achievement drive and human relation attitude), which are necessary for a successful leader, are all present in the top management. In most of the cases, the leadership is task oriented. In managerial grid the leadership style is somewhat like (9, 5) that is concern for production is 9 and concern for people is 5, in the continuum of leadership behavior the leadership is “manager sales decision” that is somewhat Boss Oriented.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>8.10.4 Mid Management Level</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mid management level of SPL is situational, professional people oriented and more on subordinate centered.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>8.10.5 Lower Level Management</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is democratic task oriented, situational and usually presents tentative decision subject to change.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>8.10.6 Identification of Corporate Culture</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The culture of an organization and that creates and reinforces particular norms of thinking, feeling and action.

The company believes in strict ethical code of business. They dedicate their knowledge, creativity, skill to the diseases, which people are still ill equipped to tackle. They believe in investing for people. Their values concern more with people than with business. They have relentless endeavor for investing cure and hope for people.

Each employee prepares a program sheet starting with works she is going to perform in the very next day. Managers of each department frequently sit for internal meeting with departmental employees to figure out the action plan, to evaluate the performance, to provide feedback and to fix future course of action.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At square, strong employee integration through effective personnel management led to maximum productivity of the company, which drives the organization at pinnacle of success.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Eva Pavlickova</p><p>Abstract: The paper deals with communication in forensic discourse. It focuses on the construction and interpretation of the testator’s intention in last wills and testaments. To guarantee precise understanding and interpretation of an intended legal message many important eventualities have to be taken into consideration at the time of their creation. There is an absence of instantaneous contact between the writer and the interpreter of a legal message. The vacuum between the production and interpretation of the testator’s intention may result in different kinds of discrepancies (spatial, temporal, social, and professional). The interpreter needs access to the context of the utterance to be capable of adequate interpretation of the testator’s intention.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>The paper is intended to provide linguistic and pragmatic insights into forensic discourse. It focuses on the complexity of expression and interpretation of intention in last wills and testaments. The goal of the research is to find out what linguistic and pragmatic devices authors of last wills use in order to externalise the intention of the testator. The article also attempts to show what factors may negatively influence the interpretation of a last will.</p><p>For the purpose of the research, the last wills and testaments of fifteen famous British and American people such as Linda McCartney, Diana, Princess of Wales, Doris Duke, Jerry Garcia, Harry B. Helmsley, Joe Jackson, John F. Kennedy, jr., John Lennon, Joe Di Maggio, Marilyn Monroe, Richard Nixon, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, David Packard, Elvis Presley, Babe Ruth were subjected to analysis. All are written in legalese. The selection of the corpus is motivated by the fact that the language of wills is viewed as one of the most resistant to changes. The wills were randomly chosen from the Internet. They vary in length (from 260 words to 16 784 words) and the time of their creation (they were made within the years 1945 and 1997) as shown in the following list:</p><p>1/        the will of Babe Ruth (3624 words; made in 1945),</p><p>2/        the will of Joe Jackson (260 words; made in 1951),</p><p>3/        the will of Marilyn Monroe (732 words; made in 1961),</p><p>4/        the Will of Elvis Presley (3480 words; made in 1977),</p><p>5/        the will of John Lennon (832 words; made in 1979),</p><p>6/        the will of David Packard (664 words; made in 1987),</p><p>7/        the will of Doris Duke (16 784 words; made in 1993),</p><p>8/        the will of Harry B. Helmsley (6245 words; made in 1994),</p><p>9/        the will of Richard Nixon (5706 words; made in 1994),</p><p>10/      the will of Diana, Princess of Wales (12 625 words; made in  1993),</p><p>11/      the will of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (12 561 words; made     in     1994),</p><p>12/      the will of Jerry Garcia (4420 words; made in 1994),</p><p>13/      the will of Joe Di Maggio (7 137 words; made in 1996),</p><p>14/      the will of Linda McCartney (4913 words; made in 1996) and</p><p>15/      the will of John F. Kennedy, jun. (1 004 words; made in 1997).</p><p>Creation and interpretation of intention in a last will and testament</p><p>A will is a legal instrument that permits a person – a testator – to make decisions on how his estate will be managed and distributed after his death. A valid will has to contain three essential elements:</p><ul><li>first, a competent testator;</li><li>second, a will must meet the execution requirements of the Statute of Wills, designed to ensure that the document is not a fraud but is the honest expression of the testator’s intention;</li><li>third, it must be clear that the testator intended the document to have the legal effect of a will. For a will to be admitted to probate, it must be clear that the testator acted freely in expressing his testamentary intention. A will executed as a result of undue influence, fraud, or mistake can be declared completely or partially void in a probate proceeding (http://legal- dictionary .thefreedictionary.com).</li></ul><p>1 Factors that influence creation and interpretation of intention in a last will and testament</p><p>Intention is a determination to perform a particular act or to act in a particular manner for a specific reason. The element of intention in last wills and testaments is enormously important. The creation and interpretation of intention in last wills and testaments may be influenced by a number of factors. In my view the following are the factors that seem to play a significant role in the process of creation and interpretation of the testator’s intention.</p><ul><li>Institutionalized language</li></ul><p>In everyday communication addressers have almost limitless devices for expressing their ideas. In the forensic environment the creative space of an addresser is considerably restricted by conventions and traditions. Communicators in forensic discourse use institutionalized language. It is a medium, process and product in the various fields of the law where legal texts, spoken or written, are generated in the service of regulating social behaviour (Maley, 1994: 11). The language of the law is a highly specialised and distinctive genre or discourse type in English. Swales (1990: 203) characterises genre as “a recognisable communicative event characterised by a set of communicative purpose(s) identified and mutually understood by the members of the professional or academic community in which it regularly occurs. Most often it is highly structured and conventionalised with constraints on allowable contributions in terms of their intent, positioning, form and functional value. These constraints, however, are often exploited by the expert members of the discourse community to achieve private intentions within the framework of socially recognised purpose(s)”.</p><ul><li>Fossilised language</li></ul><p>A last will and testament is a legal document and its writers often use established words and phrases (they can safely rely on) “regardless of what a testator had in mind” (Melinkoff, 1963: 297). Moreover, legal language is sometimes called a frozen variety of English because legal draftsmen prefer to use terms which have stood the test of time (Bhatia 1994: 140). According to Melinkoff (1963: 25), who himself is a lawyer, “the language of the law is often unclear – plain muddy” and “lawyers use many ‘dead and deadly words’. This is not to say that the language is devoid of meaning. Simply that if there is any meaning, it is hard to find it ”. All this makes communication in the legal environment more difficult and the interpretation of an intention of a last will less straightforward.</p><ul><li>Discrepancies in legal communication</li></ul><p>The paper tries to cast some light on the nature of legal communication from the pragmatic point of view. When the meaning of a will is so ambiguous that it might be interpreted in multiple ways, courts usually look for extrinsic evidence. I think that there are also non-linguistic elements of the real world that play an important role in pragmatics of legal communication. Pragmatics takes into consideration the use of language in communication, particularly relationships between utterances and contexts, i.e.</p><p>the situations in which they are uttered, as well as the relationships between the participants in terms of the intention with which the addresser enters the communicative situation. One of the areas of pragmatics ‘operation’ is the analysing of people’s speech and their intentions, which are often hidden behind the linguistic forms they use.</p><p>a/ discrepancy between the real and model context</p><p>Last wills and testaments are designed for future time. They are interpreted after some time. As the context changes depending on a particular time and a particular place, etc., the meaning may become different in a new context. The context determines the ‘actual communicative validity’ of the sentence. When an individual decides to make a last will and testament, they go to lawyers and ask them to draft the legal document. When a testator asks a lawyer to prepare a will in accordance with the established and required form, he expects that the language the lawyer has employed will also mean the same after some years. When the last will is interpreted the testator is not present to testify the intention implied in the language of his will. The intent of the testator, whether explicitly or implicitly expressed, must be clear to its interpreter. The linguistic means have to guarantee the accuracy of the transmission of the legal message. Hence, the lawyer who writes the will has to find appropriate linguistic means to express the intention of the testator precisely. If this requirement is not fulfilled, the writer risks that he will not be understood correctly. A problem occurs when there is not enough information to indicate what exactly the testator had in mind. In these cases courts rely on a virtual reasonable testator and his response in a given situation. The discrepancy is “between imagining what the real testator reasonably might have intended and imagining what an imagined reasonable person might have intended” http://www.cardozolawreview.com. There is a paradox between a model context hypothetically created by an interpreter and the real context in which the legal message was created.</p><p>b/professional discrepancy</p><p>In legal communication a lawyer is needed for both creating a legal document and its interpretation. When in certain circumstances an individual, a layman, gets seriously interested in reading and understanding a last will and testament it becomes very difficult for him to cope with it. A layman is not capable of interpreting a last will, he needs a lawyer who acts as an interpreter. The interpreter tries to understand what the writer means. The role of a lawyer is not just to interpret but also to simplify and reinterpret a legal text when explaining it to a layman. He first interprets legal information to himself and then reinterprets it in a simplified form to a layman. He attempts to transform the creator’s ideas into a form that can be more easily understood by a layman. This complicated process includes the interpretation of legal information, its simplification, and reinterpretation for a layman. It is not a dialogue but a ‘trilogue’ (exchange of information among three basic parties) or a polylogue (conversation among more than three participants).</p><p>c/ discrepancy between impersonality and subjectivity</p><ul><li>also see a paradox between the impersonality and subjectivity of legal writing. The subjectivity results from the fact that the two activities – creating and then interpreting – are usually done by two different lawyers and separated by quite a long temporal gap. Brown and Yule (1983: 11) admit that the perception and interpretation of a text may, then, be subjective. Impersonality lies in the fact that the illocutionary force goes from an unknown writer to an unknown interpreter. The writer addresses his message to someone who is spatially and temporarily distant.</li></ul><p>All this proves that it is very important for the writer of a last will and testament to choose the most suitable linguistic means, those that convey the information in the most precise form, to be easily understood in the future time when the will is interpreted. According to Yule (1996: 15) the writer “has to project themselves into mental, social, temporal and spatial locations, different from theirs without actually being in these locations”.</p><ul><li>Analysis</li></ul><p>During the analysis I focused my attention on the linguistic means used by the writers of the selected last wills to express the testator’s intention. The analysis shows that in order to externalise the testator’s intention the writers of the examined last wills most frequently use the noun intention. In all found examples it is pre-modified by the possessive pronoun my which accentuates the testator’s personal will and desire. The pre-modified noun my intention is used in the wills in different structures:</p><ul><li>Intention section</li></ul><p>The last will of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis contains a special section called Intention which does not seem to be a commonly accepted part in all the examined last wills. The writer starts the section with the phrase It is my intention to do something … which stresses the importance of the section:</p><ol start="8"><li>Intention. It is my intention to insure that the interest committed to the qualified charitable beneficiaries by this Paragraph A shall be deductible for income and estate tax purposes under the provisions -of the Code. Further, I intend that payments of gross income made by the Trustees to qualified charitable beneficlaries [sic] qualify as income tax charitable deductions. Accordingly, I direct that all provisions of this Paragraph A and this my Will shall be construed to effectuate this intention, that all provisions of this Paragraph A and this my Will shall be construed, and the trust be administered, solely in a manner consistent with sections 170(c), 642(c), and 2055 of the Code,… (The Will of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis)</li></ol><ul><li>Structures containing the noun intention</li></ul><p>In all the examined phrases I found the noun intention in differently modified phrases: a/ It is my intention that:</p><p>It is my intention that my husband shall be entitled to receive that degree of benefit from the trust which is requisite for the allowance of, the marital deduction. (The Will of Linda L. McCartney)</p><p>It is my intention that The Doris Duke Foundation receive no benefit from my estate under this Will or the exercise of any power of appointment under this Will. (The Will of Doris Duke)</p><p>It is my intention that each of the foundations created hereunder shall be an organization qualifying under Sections 501(c)(3) and 170(c) of the Code, gifts or bequests to which are deductible for federal estate and gift tax purposes under the provisions of Sections 2055(a) and 2522(a), respectively, of the Code. (The Will of Doris Duke)</p><p>b/ the writer of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s will adds the intensifying word express to highlight restrictedness of the testator’s aspiration :</p><p>NINTH: A. By directing payment of the aforesaid taxes from my residuary estate only in so far as those taxes are generated by property passing under this my Will, it is my express intention that the property over which I possess a general power of appointment and to which I refer in Article FOURTH of this my Will shall bear its own share of such taxes. (The Will of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis)</p><p>c/ in Jerry Garcia’s will the writer uses an altered form of the phrase It is my intention by this Will:</p><p>It is my intention by this Will to dispose of all my separate Property and of my one-half (1/2) interest in our community property. (The Will of Jerry Garcia )</p><p>d/ In the will of Doris Duke the next intention is introduced by the phrase it is my further intention that:</p><p>…it is my further intention that any court having jurisdiction over this Will shall construe and interpret and, if necessary, modify and limit the terms and provisions of this Will so as to permit such remainder interest so to qualify; may qualify, and by the survivor, survivors and successors of them. (The Will of Doris Duke)</p><p>e/ The phrase it would not be inconsistent with my intention if expresses Babe Ruth’s inconsistency with the potential future acts:</p><p>Furthermore, it would not be inconsistent with my intention if the trust eventually were to terminate in favor of one or more tax-exempt organizations. However, I leave the decision as to how these matters are handled to the sole discretion of my Trustees. (The Will of Babe Ruth)</p><p>f/ Jerry Garcia’s intention is articulated by I declare my intention to do something.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Eva Pavlickova</p><ul><li>Structures containing the noun will</li></ul><p>a/ the results of the analysis show that the writers of the examined last wills often use synonyms of the noun intention or the verb intend. One of them is the noun will. Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture describes the noun will as a strong determination to act in a particular way; as an intention. In some of the examined last wills the structure It is my will that is used to introduce testator’s intention.</p><p>ITEM ONE: It is my will that as soon after my death as possible my Executor, hereinafter named, shall pay all my just debts and expenses of burial. (The Will of Joe Jackson)</p><ul><li>Structures containing the noun wish</li></ul><p>The noun wish is defined by Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture as an attempt to make a particular desired thing or situation happen. In the examined last wills both the noun and the verb wish are used to express what the testator wants to be done after his death.</p><p>a/ The noun is used in the structure IT is my wish that:</p><p>8 IT is my wish (but without placing them under any binding obligation) that my executors employ the firm of Mishcon de Reya of 21 Southampton Row London WC1B 5HS in obtaining a Grant of Probate to and administering my estate… (The Will of Diana)</p><p>It is my wish, however, that in selecting the particular qualified charitable beneficiaries which shall be the recipients of benefits from the Foundation the independent Trustees give preferential consideration to such eligible organization or organizations the purposes and endeavors of which the independent Trustees feel are committed to making a significant difference in the cultural or social betterment of mankind or the relief of human suffering. (The Will of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis)</p><p>b/ The noun wish is also found in the structure I express the wish that where the verb express underlines the dynamism of the utterance:</p><p>SHOULD any child of mine be under age at the date of the death of the survivor of myself and my husband I APPOINT my mother and my brother EARL SPENCER to be the guardians of that child and I express the wish that should I predecease my husband he will consult with my mother with regard to the upbringing education and welfare of our children… (The Will of Diana)</p><ul><li>Structures containing the verb wish</li></ul><p>a/ According to Longman Dictionary of English Language and Culture the verb wish formally expresses to want. To convey the testator’ intention it is used in the indicative mood present tense with the first person singular pronoun I.</p><p>21 WISH to be buried. (The Will of Diana)</p><p>b/ In the following last will the verb wish is used with the emphasizing verb do.

I consider the phenomenon to be repetitions. It is a characteristic feature of legal English. Repetitions are words of the same grammatical category (verbs, adjectives, nouns) with identical or similar meaning joined together by co-ordinating conjunctions and/or or. These pairs of words (or ‘the-same-word-class multi-numbered expressions’) are often collections of words of Latin and/or French origin and an English word; however, they are sometimes of English origin only. The Latin phrase eiusdem generis/ejusdem generis means of the same kind and denotes a rule of legal interpretation, that when a word or a phrase follows two or more other words or phrases, it is construed to be of the same type as the words or phrases which precede it. (Dictionary of Law, 1993: 84) The origin of this kind of repetition seems to have been in the times when French was replacing Latin. A French word was added to a Latin one with the aim of avoiding any misinterpretation. Later when English was replacing French one of the foreign words or both of them was/were replaced with their English synonym/s. In some cases a third word of English origin was added to one or two foreign words. All the words refer to the same item. Crystal (1997: 208) doubts whether they always conveyed the same meaning and calls them ‘synonyms or ‘near synonyms’.</p><p>a/ It is my will and intention</p><p>Many times the noun intention is used in combination with the noun will in the structure It is my will and intention. It emphasises the performativeness of an utterance.</p><p>It is my will and intention that in dealing with the affairs and securities of any corporation in which I shall be interested at the time of my death, either as creditor or stockholder, or with the affairs and securities of any corporation in which my Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, may at any time be interested on behalf of my estate, as creditors or stockholders, my said Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, shall have and may exercise all of the powers that might lawfully be exercised by an individual owning said stock or obligation and acting in his own right and interest. (The Will of Babe Ruth)</p><p>b/ It is interesting that the noun hope on its own is not found to introduce the testator’s intention. In the analysed last wills it is used only in combination with the noun expectation. Hope is always used as the first element in the structure It is my hope and expectation. In my view the usage of the two synonyms (hope, expectation) can also make the testator’s intention clearer.</p><p>It is my hope and expectation that my Executors and Trustees and the foundations in which I am a member, director, trustee or officer at my death or which are to be created under this Will shall employ as many of these persons as reasonably possible in order to maintain my various properties and to operate these foundations after my death. (The Will of Doris Duke)</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In spite of the fact that writers of last wills and testaments try to express intentions explicitly, its interpretation is sometimes troublesome. Thus, it is vital to verbalise the testator’s intention precisely. The findings prove my expectation: despite the fact that certain predetermined forms of expressing the testator’s intention exist, writers of last wills have adequate ‘manoeuvring room’ at their disposal. They continue to employ traditional linguistic forms but they also make use of less established ones.</p><p>References</p><p>Bhatia, V. K.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>The dower rights have existed in many nations in one form or the other including Arabs. However, the concept of dower rights was refined by God and his prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Islam makes dower obligatory whether written in the marriage certificate or not.</p><p>A dower may be specified or proper. However, dower rights become payable on divorce or death of husband if not paid immediately after marriage. No Muslim is allowed to take back the dower amount whether specified or proper in any condition. <i>The Quran</i> protects the rights of women as: ‘And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift’ (<i>Quran 4:4.)</i></p><p>And “If ye had given the latter (wife) a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it back: Would ye take it by slander and manifest wrong?” <i>(Quran 4:20</i> Abdullah Yusufali).</p><p>A species of life estate that a woman is, by law, entitled to claim on the death of her husband, in the lands and tenements of which he was seized in fee during the marriage, and which her issue, if any, might by possibility have inherited. The life estate to which every married woman is entitled on the death of her husband, intestate, or, in case she dissents from his will, one-third in value of all lands of which her husband was beneficially seized in law or in fact, at any time during overture.</p><p>The real property must be inheritable by the wife’s offspring in order for her to claim dower. Even if, however, their marriage produces no off spring, the wife is entitled to dower as long as any such progeny of her husband would qualify as his heirs at the time of his death. Prior to the death of the husband, the interest of the wife is called an inchoate right of dower, in the sense that it is a claim that is not a present interest but one that might ripen into a legally enforceable right if not prohibited or divested. It is frequently stated that an inchoate right of dower is a mere expectancy and not an estate. The law governing dower rights is the law in existence at the time of the husband’s death and not the law existing at the time of the marriage.</p><p>The courts, however, protect the inchoate right of dower from a fraudulent conveyance—a transfer of property made to defraud, delay, or hinder a creditor, or in this case, the wife, or to place such property beyond the creditor’s reach—by the husband in contemplation of, or subsequent to, the marriage. Protection is also available against the claims of creditors if the claims arose after the marriage. The posting of security can be required to protect the interest if oil, gas, or other substances are removed from the land, which thereby results in a depreciation—a reduction of worth—with respect to the value of the estate. Decisions supporting a contrary view take the position that a wife cannot interfere with her husband’s complete enjoyment of the land during his lifetime.</p><p>A wife can relinquish her inchoate right of dower by an ante nuptial agreement—which is a contract entered into by the prospective spouses prior to the marriage that resolves issues of support, division of property, and distribution of wealth in the event of death, separation, or divorce—or by a release, that is, the relinquishment of a right, claim, or privilege.</p><p>The claim of dower is based upon proof of a legally recognized marriage, as distinguished from a Good Faith marriage or a De facto marriage—one in which the parties live together as Husband and Wife but that is invalid for certain reasons, such as defects in form. A voidable marriage, one that is valid when entered into and which remains valid until either party obtains a lawful court order dissolving the marital relationship, suffices for this purpose if it is not rendered void—of no legal force or binding effect—before the right to the dower arises.</p><p>Most states have varied the dower provisions. The fraction of the estate has frequently been increased from one-third to one-half. The property affected has been expanded from realty only to both realty and personality. The time of ownership has sometimes been changed from “owned during marriage” to “own at death.” The type of interest given to the surviving spouse has been expanded from a life estate to outright ownership of property.</p><p>In many states, a widow is entitled to a statutory share in her husband’s estate. This is often called an elective share because the surviving spouse can choose to accept the provisions made for her in the decedent’s will or accept the share of the property specified by law of Descent and Distribution or the particular law governing the elective share. In many jurisdictions, dower has been abolished and replaced by the elective share. In others, statutes expressly provide that a spouse choose among the elective share, the dower, or the provisions of the will.</p><p><strong>Definition of Dower or Mahr</strong></p><p>Mahr or dower is a sum of money or offer property which the wife is entitled to receive from the husband in consideration of the marriage.</p><p>Mahr or dower is a sum that becomes payable by the husband to the wife on marriage either by agreement between the parties or by operation of Law. It may either be prompt or deferred.</p><p>According to wolson, “Dower” is a consideration for the surrender of person by the wife. It is the technical Anglo- Mohammedan term for its equivalent “Mahr” in Arabic.</p><p>According to Ameer Ali, “Dower” is a consideration which belongs absolutely to the wife.</p><p>According to Dr. Jung defines, “Dower” as the property or its equivalent, incumbent on the husband either by reason of being agreed in the contract of marriage or by virtue of a separated contract, as special consideration of Buza, the right of enjoyment itself.[3]</p><p>According to Baillie, “the property which is incumbent on a husband, either by reason of its being named in the contract of marriage, or by virtue of the contract itself. Dower is not the endanger or consideration given by the man to the women for entering into the contract; but an effect to the contract imposed by the law on the husband as a token of respect for its subject, the women.[4]                                In order to constitute a valid marriage, the Mohammedan law requires that there should always be a consideration moving from the husband in favuors of the wife, for her sole and exclusive use and benefit. This consideration is called mahr or sadak in legal treatises and in common parlance dain mahr.</p><p>The principle of ante nuptial settlements is not peculiar to the Mohammedan law. Sautayra thinks that the custom originated in ancient times with the payments which the husbands often made to their wives as a means of support and as a protection against the arbitrary exercise of the power of divorce.</p><p>The above opinions are based on the argument that marriage is a civil contract and dower is a consideration for the contract. But it is submitted that the above opinions are erroneous, because even in those cases where no is specified at the time of marriage, marriage is not void on that recount, but the law requires that some dower should be paid to the wit. Abdur Rahim correctly observes, “It is not a consideration preceding from the husband for the contract of marriage, but it is an obligation imposed by the law on the husband as mark of respect for the wife as is evident from the fact that the non- specification of dower at the time of marriage does not affect the validity of marriage.[6]</p><p><strong>Classification of Dower</strong></p><p><strong>Broadly, there are two kinds of dower: (i) specified and (ii) unspecified.</strong></p><p><strong>Specified Dower</strong></p><p>Specified dower is that dower which is fixed at the time of marriage or later on. There are provisions relating to dower under sections 13, 14, 15, 16 and 20 of the kabinnama [Form-E] according to <i>the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Rule 1975.</i> When a husband agrees to pay to his wife a residential building or one lakh taka as mahr, it is an example of specified mahr.[7]</p><p><strong>The specified dower has been further divided into- (a) prompt and (b) deferred.</strong></p><p><strong>Prompt Dower (Muajjal Mahr)</strong></p><p>It is payable immediately after marriage on demand. According to Ameer Ali, a wife can refuse to enter into conjugal domicile of husband until the payment of the prompt dower. The following point must be noted regarding prompt dower:    Prompt dower is payable immediately on the marriage taking place and it must be paid on demand unless delay is stipulated for or agreed. It can be realized any time before or after the marriage. The wife may refuse herself to cohabit with her husband, until the prompt dower is paid. If the wife is minor, her guardian may refuse to allow her to be sent to the husband’s house till the payment of prompt dower. In such circumstances, the husband is bound to maintain the wife, although she is residing apart from him.<b></b></p><p>It was held in <i>Rehana Khatun v. Iqtider Uddin,</i> that the prompt portion of the dower may be realized by the wife at any time before or after consummation.[8] In the case of <i>Mahadev Lal v. Bibi Maniran<b>[9]</b></i> it was decided that prompt dower does not become deferred after consummation of marriage, and a wife has absolute right to sue for recovery of prompt dower even after consummation. Dower which is not paid at once may, for that reason, be described as deferred dower, but if it is postponed until demanded by the wife it is in law prompt dower.</p><p>It is only on the payment of the prompt dower that the husband becomes entitled to enforce the conjugal rights unless the marriage is already consummated. The right of restitution arises only after the dower has been paid.</p><p>As the prompt dower is payable on demand, limitation begins to run on demand and refusal. The period of limitation for this purpose is three years. If during the continuance of marriage, the wife does not make any demand, the limitation begins to run only from the date of the dissolution of marriage by death or divorce.</p><p>Although prompt dower, according to Muslim law, is payable immediately on demand, yet, in a large majority of cases it is rarely demanded and is rarely paid, in practice a Muslim husband generally gives little thought to the question of paying dower to his wife save when there is domestic disagreement, or when the wife presses for payment upon the husband’s embarking upon a course of extravagance and indebtedness without making any provision for the lapse of time since marriage raises no presumption in favour of the payment of dower.</p><p><b>Deferred</b> <b>dower</b></p><p>It is payable on dissolution of marriage either by death or divorce. According to Ameer Ali generally in India dower is a penal sum with the object to compel husband to fulfill marriage contract in its entirety. The following points must be noted regarding deferred dower:</p><p>Deferred dower is payable on dissolution of marriage by death or divorce. But if there is any agreement as to the payment of deferred dower earlier then such an agreement would be valid and binding.</p><p>The wife is not entitled to demand payment of deferred dower, but the husband can treat it as prompt and pay or transfer the property in lieu of it such a transfer will not be void as a fraudulent preference unless actual insolvency is involved. The widow may relinquish her dower at the time of her husband’s funereal by the recital of a formula. Such a relinquishment must be a voluntary act of the widow.</p><p>The interest of the wife in the deferred dower is a vested one and not a contingent one. It is not liable to be displaced by the hampering of any event, not even on her death; as such her heirs can claim the money if she dies.</p><p>If the kabinnama, the marriage contract deed, fixes the amount of dower but fails to show what portion of it will be prompt and what deferred dower, according to Allahabad and Bombay High courts the proportion between the two should be fixed on the basis of (i) position of the wife, (ii) custom of locality, (ii) total amount of dower, (iv) status of the husband.</p><p>Shia law- Under Ithna Ashari shia law if the kabinnama fixes the total amount of dower but does not specify as to what portion of it will be prompt and what deferred, the whole of the dower is regarded as prompt.</p><p>In the Madras presidency, unless otherwise stipulated the entire dower is prompt no matter the parties are Shia or Sunni.</p><p>Sunni law- According to Sunni law, in the absence of any family usage and statement in kabinnama, half of the total amount is regarded as prompt and half as deferred.</p><p><strong>Proper dower (mahr-i-mithl)</strong></p><p>Its size is to be determined in view of the socio-economic conditions of the parties involved.</p><p>If no mahr has been agreed or expressly stipulated by the parties, the contract of marriage is still valid. This also means that if no mahr sum is specified in the marriage contract, the husband is not thereby released from his liability to pay a dower. Even a statement that no dower shall be paid does not change the position. In these circumstances, what is known as the ‘proper dower’ becomes due. It is worked out on the basis of the mahr agreed for women of a similar social status to the wife. Particularly relevant will be the mahr paid to other female members of the wife’s family, for instance sisters, paternal aunts and female cousins.[11]</p><p>There is no limit to the maximum amount of proper dower under the Sunni law, but under the Shia law the proper dower should not exceed 500 Dirham. 500 Dirham was the amount of dower which was fixed in the marriage of Fatima, the prophet’s daughter. In the Shia Muslims it is, therefore, considered a point of honour not to stipulate for a sum higher than the sum of dower fixed by the prophet for his daughter, Fatima.</p><p><strong>Subject matter of Dower</strong></p><p>The subject matter of dower is not only confined to a sum of money or property; it includes personal services and other things. According to a tradition, Amir- bin- Rabia said, “that a woman of the tribe of Bani Fazarah married on a settlement of a pair of shoes, and the prophet said to her ‘Are you pleased to give yourself and your property for these two shoes: she said, ‘Yes’. Then the prophet approved of the marriage.’’ The followings were recognized as the subject of dower: A handful of dates (Abu Daud). A pair of shoes (Tirmizi). If the husband is a slave, his services to his wife (Mohit Sarkhsee). The services of the husband’s slaves to the wife (Fatawa-i Alamgir) Husband’s services rendered to the guardian of a minor wife (Durrul Muktar). Teaching Koran to the wife (Tradition).</p><p>In fact, the main contention of the Muslim Jurists is that anything which comes within the definition of meal can be the subject matter of dower. Thus, apart from the personal services of the husband, any profits arising from land or business, debts due to the husband, insurance policies, chooses-in-action, the sale proceeds of something, may constitute valid dower.</p><p>If the subject matter of dower be “an animal” or “cloth”, then the wife is entitled to mahr-ul-misl, proper dower because such dowers are invalid for uncertainty. Similarly, “a have” or “the land” without specifying the exact location and description are not fit subjects of dower, and the court will have to fix proper dowers in such cases.</p><p><b>Contract of amount of dower in marriage &amp; contract of dower made by father</b></p><p>The amount of dower may be fixed either before or after marriage and can be increased after marriage. It was held in <i>Basir Ali v. Hafiz</i> that the amount of dower may be entered into by the father of the bride.</p><p>The father of a minor son may make a contract on dower on his behalf and it would be binding on the son even if it was made after his marriage during the minority of the son. The father, if he acts as guardian for the marriage of his infant son, he is not personally liable unless he expressly becomes a surety for the dower stipulated. Otherwise the father only acts on behalf of the minor son and binds the latter and not himself personally. When a father enters into a contract of dower on behalf of his son, he makes himself a surety for due payment of dower in case his minor son has no means of paying it.</p><p><strong>Amounts of Dower and Conditions of Payment</strong></p><h3>This may be divided into two-</h3><ol><li>If the marriage is consummated, and is dissolved by death:</li></ol><p>(a)    Whole of the specified dower in case of regular marriage.</p><p>(b)   Proper dower if unspecified in case of regular marriage.</p><p>(c)    Specified or proper dower, whichever is less, in the case of irregular marriage.</p><ol><li>If the marriage is not consummated, and is dissolved by the act of party:</li></ol><p>1. When divorced by the husband-</p><ol><li>Half of the specified dower, in case of regular marriage: in case of regular marriage.</li><li>A present of three articles if unspecified: in case of regular marriage.</li><li>When divorced by the wife: No dower.</li><li>If the marriage is irregular in the wises and above: No dower.</li></ol><p><strong>Maximum &amp; Minimum Amounts of Dower</strong></p><p>The amount of dower or mahr varies in different countries; there is no fixed rule as to the maximum (mus’ab Settled a dower of 500,000 dirham or the granddaughter of Abu Bakre. The Prophet did not enunciate any fixed rule as to the amount of dower. He expressly left it to custom and local usages but as he appears to have settled 500 dirham upon Maimuna, the Shias consider that amount to be the mahr-i-sunnat. The Radd-ul-Muhtar says the dower of “our lady” Fatima was 400 dirham). It depends on the social position of the parties and the conditions of society in which they live. The Radd-ul-Muhtar lays this down with considerable distinctness. “Whatever amount exceeding the minimum the man agrees to pay he will be liable therefore”.</p><p>The Shiah Shara’ya says: “there is no limit either to the maximum or the minimum of dower,” it being a matter of contract between husband and wife; So long as the article given or assigned by way of dower possesses any definite value, the assignment is considered valid. There is no distinction so far as this principle is concerned between the Shias and the Sunnis. Both schools, however, regard excessive dower as improper though not absolutely illegal; but, as will be seen, this recommendation is totally disregarded by the Indian Musulmans, for reasons which have been explained in the Introduction.</p><p>The early Hanafi lawyers fixed ten dirham, as the minimum for dower. The Malikis inhabiting a poorer and less populous country than that in which the early Hanafi lawyers flourished, considered even a smaller sum as permissible.</p><p>These minimums have become obsolete and it is now customary in different countries to fix the amount of dower entirely by a consideration of the circumstances of the husband and wife.</p><p>Among Sunnis there is no maximum; any amount may be fixed. Some of the sects of Shias, however, there is a tendency “not to stipulate for a sum higher then the minimum fixed by the Prophet for his favorite daughter Fatima, the wife of Ali, namely 500 dirham.’’</p><p><strong>Increase or Decrease of Dower</strong></p><p>The husband may at any time after marriage increase the dower. Likewise, the wife may remit the dower wholly or partially in favor of her husband or his heirs. A Muslim girl who has attained puberty is competent to relinquish her Mahr although she may not have attained majority (18 years) within <i>the Bangladesh Majority Act.  </i>The remission of the Mahr by a wife called Hibe-e-Mahr.</p><p>But the remission made by the wife, should be with free consent. It was held in the case of <i>Nurunnessa v. Khaje Mahomed<b>[19]</b></i> that where the wife was subject to the mental distress, on account of her husband’s death the remission of dower, was considered as against her consent and not binding on her.</p><p>In has been held in a (<i>Karachi case) Shah Bano v. Iftekar Mohammed</i>, that in certain cases remission of dower cannot be upheld. For instance, if a wife feels that the husband is increasingly showing indifference to her and the only possible way to retain the affection of her husband is to give up her claim of Maher and forgoes her claim by executing a document, she is not a free agent and it may be against justice and equity to hold that she is bound by the terms of the deed.</p><p><strong>Historical Background of Dower</strong></p><p>It is said that during pre-historic times man lived a barbaric life, which had the tribal form. For unknown reasons mrriage was prohibited between a male and a female of the same blood. Hence the young men of a tribe, who wanted to marry, were compelled to choose their wives from some other tribe. They often visited other tribes for this purpose. At that time man was not aware of his role in begetting children. He thought that the children belonged exclusively to their mother. Though he often found that the children closely resembled him, he did not know the cause of that resemblance. Naturally the children also thought that they belonged to their mother and not to their father. At that time ancestry was traced through the mothers. Men were considered to be barren and sterile. After marriage they stayed with their wife’s tribe as a mere adjunct of it, because the wife required her husband’s company. This period is known as the period of matriarchy.</p><p>It was not long before man discovered his role in procreation and came to believe that the children in reality belonged to him. From then onwards, he dominated over woman and assumed the role of the head of the family. Thus, the so called period of patriarchy began.</p><p>During this period also a marriage between the people having the same blood was prohibited. Man had to choose his wife from some other tribe, and bring her to his own tribe. As there was constant warfare among the tribes, the only way to get a wife was to kidnap a young girl from some other tribe.</p><p>Gradually peace took the place of warfare and the different tribes were able to achieve peaceful coexistence. During this period the custom of kidnapping the girls was abolished. In order to get the girl of his choice the man went to her tribe, became a hired worker of her father and worked for him for some time. In consideration of the services rendered by him the girl’s father gave her hand to him and he took her to his own tribe.</p><p>When money became common, man discovered that instead of serving the bride’s father for years, it was better to present a suitable gift to him and take the girl immediately. That was the origin of the dower <i>(mahr).</i></p><p>According to this account, in the early days man lived as an adjunct of woman and served her. During this period woman ruled over man. In the next stage, when power passed into man’s hands, he kidnapped women from some other tribe. During the third stage, in order to win a woman, man went to woman’s father and served him for years. During the fourth stage man presented a sum of money to the woman’s father. And that is how the custom of dower originated.</p><p>It is said that since the time man abolished the system of matriarchy and laid the foundation of patriarchy, he gave woman the status of a slave, or at the most, of an employee or a servant of his. He looked upon her as an economic tool, which, by the way, could satisfy his lust also. He did not give her social or economic independence. The fruits of woman’s labour belonged either to her father or to her husband. She did not have the right to choose her husband, nor could she carry out any economic activity for her own sake. The money which man paid as dower and the expenses which he bore as maintenance <i>(nafaqah) </i>were in consideration of the economic gains which he derived from her during the period of conjugal relations.</p><p><strong>Importance or Significance of Dower</strong></p><p>According to our belief, the dower has come into being as the result of skilful arrangements, put into the very design of creation, to balance the relations between man and woman. The dower has come into being, because, by nature, the respective roles of man and woman are different from each other. According to the Gnostics the law of love and attraction prevails everywhere in the Universe. As everything is designed to perform a definite function, its role is different from that of all other things.</p><p>While discussing the disparities between man and woman, we have already pointed out that their feelings and sentiments, with regard to each other, are not the same. The law of creation has ordained that woman should have the qualities of beauty, pride and indifference, whereas man should have those of courting and pursuit. That is how the physical weakness of woman, as compared to man, has been counterbalanced, and for this very reason it has always been man who has sought women hand and proposed to her. As we have already seen, according to the sociologists, during the periods of both matriarchy and patriarchy, it has been man who has sought after woman.</p><p>The scientists say that man is more lustful than woman. Certain Islamic traditions say that man is not more lustful. Actually the case is the reverse, but woman has a better sense of self-restraint. Practically, both the views come to the same thing. Anyway, it is certain that man has less self-control. This feature has enabled woman not to run after man, nor to submit to him easily. Man’s instinct compels him to approach woman, and he takes steps to gain her favour. One of these steps is to present her with a gift.</p><p>Members of the male sex have always vied with each other to win a female. They have even fought each other to achieve this end. But the members of the female sex have never shown the same keenness to win a male. This is so, because the roles of the male and the female are not the same. The male always pursues a female whereas the female shows a sort of indifference to him.</p><p>The dower is closely related to woman’s modesty and chastity. She knows by instinct that her self-respect demands that she should not submit herself freely.</p><p>That is how woman, in spite of her physical weakness, has been able to bring men to their knees, to compel them to vie with each other, and to make Romeos run after Juliet. When she agrees to marry a man, she receives a present from him as a sign of friendship, cordiality and goodwill.</p><p>It is said that among some barbaric tribes, when a girl had more than one suitor, she used to persuade them to fight a duel. Whoever won the duel or killed his rival was considered fit to secure the hand of the girl.</p><p>There was a newspaper report that a girl in Tehran persuaded two boys to fight a duel in her presence. From the point of view of those who think that power means only brutal force and maintains that the history of man-woman relations contains nothing but cases of cruelty and exploitation, it is unbelievable that the fair and weaker sex should be able to set on two members of the stronger sex to attack each other. But for those who have some knowledge of the wonderful and mysterious power which nature has granted to woman there is nothing strange in this.</p><p>Woman has had much influence over man. Her influence over man has been greater than man’s influence over her. Man is indebted to woman and to her chastity and charming modesty for his many achievements of art and feats of bravery. The credit for the building of many a personality and the developing of many a genius goes to her. Woman has built man and man has built the society. If woman loses her qualities of chastity, modesty and restraint, and tries to play the role of man, first she may be debased, then man may lose his manhood, and in the end the society may be ruined.</p><p>That faculty of woman, has enabled her to maintain her personality throughout history; to compel man to come to her door-step as a suitor; to lead man to rivalry and even to fight for her sake; to maintain her modesty and chastity as her hallmark; to keep her body hidden from the gaze of man; to inspire man to love to perform feats of bravery, as a sacred asset; to excel in intellectual and creative deeds; to sing amorous songs and to submit to the weaker sex in humility. Hence this tendency has impelled bridegroom to offer his bride a present at the time of marriage as the dower.</p><p>The dower is a part of the natural law, which has been promulgated by nature itself.</p><p>Difference between Sunni &amp; Shia Law Regarding Dower</p><p><strong>Sunni Law</strong></p><p>A minimum limit of 10 dirham’s is prescribed for specified dower.</p><p>There is no limit to proper dower.</p><p>There is no maximum limit for specific dower.</p><p>If marriage is dissolved by death and dower has not been specified, or it is agreed that no dower shall be payable, proper dower would be due whether the marriage was consummated or not.</p><p>An agreement that no dower shall be due is void.</p><p>In the absence of an agreement only a reasonable part of the dower is presume to be prompt.</p><p><b>Shia Law</b></p><p>No minimum limit is prescribed. Proper dower cannot exceed 500 dirham’s. Fixing of dower exceeding 500 dirham’s is considered abominable though not  Illegal. In such case no dower would be due if the marriage was not consummated. Such agreement by sane and adult wife is valid. The whole dower is presumed to be promp</p><p><strong>The Quran</strong></p><p>The form of the dower described above in connection with the fifth stage is not an invention of <i>the Quran.</i> All that <i>the Qur’an</i> did was to restore it to its natural and pristine form. <i>The Quran</i> in its incomparably elegant style says: “Give to the women a free gift of their marriage portions”.<i> </i>(Surah an-Nisa, 4 : 4) This means that the dower belongs to women exclusively and it is a gift to be paid directly to them. It has nothing to do with their fathers or brothers.</p><p>In this short sentence the Holy <i>Quran </i>has referred to three basic points:  Firstly it has used for marriage portion or the dower the word, saduqatehinna meaning truthfulness and sincerity and not the word mehr. Thus, the dower is a symbol of the cordiality of the man paying it. This point has been expressly mentioned by a number of the commentators of the Holy <i>Quran,</i> such as Zamakhshari, the author of the well-known commentary, the Kashshaf Similarly, the famous philologist, Raghib Isfahani says in his lexicon of <i>the Quran</i> that the dower has been called saduqah because it is a symbol of the sincerity of faith. Secondly, it is clear from the above verse of <i>the Quran</i> that the dower is to be paid directly to the woman, and her parents have no claim to it. It is not a compensation for the efforts made by them to bring up their daughter.</p><p>The Holy <i>Quran</i> abolished many pre- Islamic Arab customs connected with dower and restored it to its natural and deserving pristine form.</p><p>According to the Islamic traditions not only a father has no claim to any part of the dower of his daughter, but it is also not permissible to include, in the marriage agreement, a condition that apart from dower anything additional would be paid to him. In other words, a father is not allowed to derive any financial gain out of the marriage of his daughter.</p><p>Islam also abolished the custom according to which a man worked for his prospective father-in-law when money had not yet become a medium of exchange. This custom did not come into existence simply because the fathers wanted to benefit through their daughters. There were other reasons also, which were characteristic of the age and were not necessarily unfair. Anyhow, there is no doubt about the existence of such a custom in the ancient world.</p><p>Anyhow, Islam has done away with this custom, and now the father of the woman has no claim to the dower, even if he wants it for spending it on his daughter. Only the woman herself has full rights to spend it as she likes.</p><p>During the pre-Islamic period there existed other customs also, which practically deprived the woman of her dower. One of them was the custom of inheriting conjugal rights. If a man died, his son or brother inherited his conjugal rights, in respect of his wife, in the same way as he inherited his property. The son or the brother of the deceased had a right, either to give the widow in marriage to another man or take her dower, or to declare her his own wife against dower already paid to her by the deceased.</p><p>The Holy <i>Quran </i>did away with this custom also. It says:</p><p>‘0 you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women forcibly” (Surahan-Nisa,4 : 19)</p><p>In another verse, the holy <i>Quran</i> has totally banned a marriage with one’s father’s wife (stepmother) even if she be willing. It says: “Marry not those women whom your father married” (Surahan-Nisa,4 : 22).</p><p>The Holy <i>Quran</i> did away with every custom which deprived woman of her dower. One of such customs was that when a man lost interest in his wife, he harassed her with a view to making her agree to a divorce on the condition that she would return, wholly or partly, the dower which she had received. The Holy <i>Quran </i>says: “Nor should you put constraint on them (women) so that you take away part of what you have given.’’ (Surahan-Nisa, 4: 19).</p><p><strong>Sunnah</strong></p><p>A hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) on the rights of woman regarding dower are as under:‑</p><p>Omme-Habibah reported that she was the wife of Abdullah‑b‑Jahash who died in the land of Abyssinia, and then the Negus gave her in marriage to the Prophet and took from him a dower of 4000 (in another narration 4000 dirhams). Then he sent her to the Prophet with Shurahbil‑b­Hasanah. (Abu Daud; Nisai)</p><p>Anas retorted that the Messenger of Allah emancipated Safiyyah and married her and made her emancipation a dower… (Bukhari arid Muslim)</p><p>Anas reported that Abu Talhah married Omme Solaim and the dower between them was Islam. Omme Solaim had accepted Islam before Abu Talhah who sought her in marriage. She said: I have surely accepted Islam; but if you accept Islam, I shall marry you. So Abu Talhah accepted Islam and it was their dower between them. (Nisai)</p><p>Oqbah‑b‑‘Amer reported that the Messenger of Allah said: The most equitable of the conditions (of marriage) is that you should fulfil that (Dower) with which you have made private parts lawful. (Bukhari and Muslim)</p><p>Jaber reported that the Messenger of Allah said: whoso gives two handful of barley or dates as dower of his wife has rendered (marriage) lawful. (Abu Daud)</p><p>Sahl‑b‑Sa’ad reported that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah and said: O, Messenger of Allah, I offer myself to you. She then kept standing for a long time. A man got up and said; O, Messenger of Allah! marry her to­(me)…The Prophet said: Have you got with you anything which we may give to her as dower? He said; I have nothing but this trouser of mine. The Prophet said: Seek, though it be a ring of iron. Then he searched but did find nothing. The Prophet asked: Have you got any portion of the Qur’an with you? ‘Yes’, said he ‘such and such a verse.’ He said: I give her in marriage to you for what is with you from the Qur’an (So teach her something from the Qur’an). (Bukhari, Muslim)</p><p>Hazrat Umar once addressed the people in the Mosque of the Prophet: O People! Why have you started fixing the dowers of women at fantastically higher amounts, while the Messenger of Allah had never fixed the dower of any of his wives at an amount exceeding four hundred Dirhams. Beware! I should not hear in future that any of you has fixed dower exceeding 400 dirhams. He then descended from the pulpit. There and then came a woman of Quraish and said: O Umar! Have not you heard the word of God (in <i>Al‑Qur’an</i> 4:20). Allah says. Even if you have given a big treasure to a woman, don’t take back anything out of that. Hazrat Umar at once returned, withdrew his order and announced: Any one of you can fix as much dower as he pleases: I can’t stop him. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir).[25]</p><p>The Sunnah has laid down the following rules and regulations regarding Hag Mohr or dower the payment of which by the husband to the wife is obligatory.</p><p>Payment of the Mahr (dower) to his wife is obligatory on the husband. It is an essential part of marriage. <i>The Qur’an</i> says: “O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou has paid their dowers”‑(33:50). At another place the <i>Qur’an </i>says:….And there is no blame on you to marry them when you give them their dowries”‑ (60:10). However, the marriage is not invalid if dower is not paid or contracted or fixed before marriage. It is apparent from verse No. 236 of chapter 2 of <i>Al‑Qur’an </i>which reads: “There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them a suitable gift.” Even in such case something is to be paid.</p><p>The amount of dower which the bridegroom has to give to his bride has not been fixed by <i>the Qur’an</i> or Sunnah. It depends entirely on the agreement of the contracting parties <i>The Qur’an</i> says:” ….The wealthy according to his means and the poor according to his means; a gift of a reasonable amount, is due from those who wish to do the right things”‑ (2:236)</p><p>There is no minimum or lower limit of dower fixed by law, though some jurists opine that it should not be less than ten dirhams. It may be in the form of cash or in kind. The Prophet (PBUH) did not fix any minimum: According to the well reported Traditions of the Prophet of Islam, even a handful of barley or dates or even an iron ring may be sufficient provided the bride agrees to accept it. The Messenger of Allah himself married Hazrat Safiyyah and her emancipation was her dower. Omme Solaim agreed to marry Abu Talha on the condition that he should accept Islam. Abu Talha fulfilled the condition and his acceptance of Islam was declared to be mahr or dower of Omme Solaim. In another case, the teaching of one or two verses of the Holy <i>Quran </i>by the husband to the wife was declared to be an adequate Mahr for the bride.</p><p>No maximum or upper limit of mahr or dower has been fixed by Islam either. <i>The Quran</i> says: “But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another, even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, take not the least bit of it back”‑ (4:20). From this verse the jurists of Islam have deduced that the right of a woman to demand any amount of dower as a condition of her agreeing to marriage is not restricted by the Islamic Law. Hazrat Umar, the second pious caliph of Islam, once thought of fixing the upper limit of dower on the complaint of the men that the women were demanding fantastic amounts; but he was dissuaded by a woman who drew his attention to verse of the Holy <i>Quran </i>quoted above.</p><p>If a person divorces his wife before touching her and before appointing any amount of dower for her, he has been directed to make provision for her according to his means (<i>Al‑Quran 2:236</i>). But if he divorces her before touching her and after fixing the amount of dower for her, he is bound to give half of the amount of dower which has been fixed. However, if the woman agrees to forgo her rights of accepting this half dower or the man shows generosity in giving her full dower, such an accord is permitted. (<i>Al‑Quran</i> 2:237)</p><p>The men should give to their wives their dower willingly. But if the women of their own accord agree to remit the whole or part of their dower, the husbands are welcome not to pay it (<i>Al‑Quran</i> 4:4). Hazrat Umar and Qazi Shuraih have decreed that if a wife remits the dower but later on demands it, the husband shall be compelled to pay it because the very fact that she demands it’ is a clear proof that she did not remit it of her own free will.<i><br/></i></p></div><div><p>According to verse no. 24 of Surah Al‑Nisa, dower has to be paid as a duty.</p></div><p><b>Remission of Dower by Wife</b></p><p>The wife who has attained puberty may remit the dower or any part of it in favour of the husband or his heirs. The remission would be valid although made without consideration. But it is valid only when made by a written instrument.</p><p>The remission should be made when the woman is acting as a free agent and the court must be satisfied that she realized what she was doing and the consequences of it. A remission mode by the wife when she is in great mental distress on account of the death of her husband is not valid. When a wife remitted her dower thinking that, it was the only way to win or retain the affection of the husband, it was held she was not acting as a free agent.</p><p>It has been held by Allahabad High court that a woman who has attained puberty can remit her dower. She can therefore do so even before she has attained the age of eighteen.</p><p>The High Courts of Madras and Patna have held that a remission made by a wife who has not attained majority under the Majority Act, 1875, is invalid, though she may have attained majority by Muslim law. A stipulation in a contract of dower that the wife should not be competent to remit her dower without the consent of her relations is valid. Where a woman feels that the possible way to win or retain the affection of the husband is to remit the dower amount, and forgoes her claim, she is not a free agent and it would be inequitable to hold that she is bound by such remission of dower.</p><p><strong>Dower Payable after Consummation of Marriage</strong></p><p>Consummation confirms or perfects the dower. So that after consummation or valid retirement a woman has a right to her dower if a separation should take place</p><p>and it does not matter whether the cause of separation his in the husband or the wife.</p><p><strong>Death before Consummation</strong></p><p>Death before consummation, the wife is entitled to her full dower. It necessarily follows that if no dower has been fixed she would get her full proper dower. Muhammadan law gives to the widow, whose dower has remained unpaid, a   very special right to enforce her demand. This is known as ‘the widows’ right of retention’. A widow lawfully in possession of her deceased husband’s estate is entitled to retain such possession until her dower debt is satisfied. Her right is not the nature of a regular charge, mortgage or a lien; it is in essence a personal right as against heirs and creditors to enforce herrights and it is a right to retain, not to obtain, possession of her husband estate.</p><p><strong>Divorce before Consummation of Marriage</strong></p><p>In case of divorce the right to dower is confirmed only when the cause of the separation lies with the husband, as when he divorces his wife or a separation takes place on account of his impotency, but the husband would not be liable to pay dower when the cause of separation lies with the wife as when she exercises the option of puberty.</p><p><b><i> Dissolution of Marriage by Talaq</i></b></p><p>If the marriage is dissolved by exercising the right of talaq by the husband then the wife is entitled to the full dower and Iddat money. But in practice, we will later see that this is rarely observed.</p><p><b><i>Dissolution of Marriage by Talaq-e- Tafweed</i></b></p><p>One of the most potent legal weapons in Muslim women’s possession is the right of delegated divorce or talaq-e-tafweed. This is a conscious effort of the female spouse or her guardian to balance the male matrimonial power. This right has been regarded by the British Indian judge as conditional and not an absolute option, depending on being reasonable and not opposed to public policy. However, conditional delegation was always recognized to be perfectly valid if the condition or contingency specified in the kabinnama was fulfilled. <i>The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961</i> has provided the option to delegate the right of divorce in the form of the kabinnama. If a marriage is dissolved by the exercise of talaq-e-tafweed then the wife is not deprived from the dower money as she has exercised the delegated power which was conferred on her by her husband.</p><p><b><i>Dissolution of Marriage by khula</i></b></p><p>Dissolution of marriage by khula is defined as an agreement between the parties to dissolve the marriage by the wife’s foregoing of dower. In khula cases women are sacrificing their right of dower in exchange for a divorce. But the case law reveals that the higher courts are turning other cases of dissolution into a case of khula to deprive women of their right to dower and to protect the financial interest of men.</p><p>Moreover, from the practical point of view, a woman may be pressurized by her husband to give khula to avoid the payment of dower which he has to give when using talaq. Thus the dissolution of marriage by khula potentially operates against women as it deprives them of their right of dower for their freedom from an undesirable marriage. It is yet to be clarified why the courts are encouraging ‘judicial khul’ more than any other grounds of dissolution.</p><p><strong>Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961</strong></p><p><i>Section 5 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance  </i> makes it absolutely necessary that the marriage solemnized under the Muslim Law shall be registered.<i> </i>Where no details about the mode of payment of dower are specified in the nikah nama, or the marriage contract, the entire amount of the dower shall be presumed to be payable on demand. High dower is fixed to prevent the husband from divorcing the wife capriciously.  This rule was followed in <i>Zakeri Begum v. Sakina Begum.</i><b></b><b><br/></b></p><p><i></i><strong>The Family Courts Ordinance, 1985</strong></p><p>Subject to the provisions of <i>the</i><i> </i><i>Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, </i>a family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain, try and dispose of any suit</p><p>relating to dower.<i> </i>It was held in <i>Shafiqul Huq (Md) v. Mina Begum,</i> that Family Court has got every jurisdiction to decide as to whether the kabinnama in question is a genuine<i> </i>and valid document or not and whether any marriage between the petitioner and opposite party was ever solemnized or not before it decides to grant any decree for dower. It was further stated in the case of <i>Jesmin Sultana v. Md. Elias</i><i><b></b></i><i> </i>that the court has no right no right to reduce the prompt dower unless the wife remits it voluntary.</p><p>Islamic law does not fix any maximum amount of dower, but makes it obligatory for the husband to pay whatever amount has been specified and whatever amount is assessed if not specified.Fixing of excessive amounts of dower is being used in South Asia as a means to control and check the husband’s unilateral and unlimited power of divorce, as he has to pay the full amount of dower at the time of divorce.   But it also acts as a status matter, in which case there is no intention to pay the stipulated amount in full.Attempts have been made to curb the fixation of excessive amounts of dower in India which go against the interests of Muslim women, but no similar provision has been made in Pakistan or later in Bangladesh. There has been some confusion over dower and dowry after the <i>Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act </i>of 1976 in Pakistan, but this has now been clarified.</p><p><strong>Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Act, 1974</strong></p><p>Dower in a Muslim marriage forms an inseparable part of the terms of the kabinamah and thus as the kabinnamah is intended to be registered under <i>the</i> <i>1974</i> <i>Act</i>, so is the dower. <i>The</i> <i>Act</i> <i>of</i> <i>1974</i> is in force relating to the registration of Muslim marriages including dower.</p><p>Muslim Marriages and Divorces (Registration) Rules, 1975</p><p>A nikah Registrar shall charge for registration of a marriage a fee at the rate of taka ten for the dower of every one thousand taka or part there of, subject to a minimum of taka fifty and a maximum of taka four thousand.</p><p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Judicial Determination of Dower Rights in Bangladesh</strong></p><p>In this chapter, I want to discuss about some dower cases of Bangladesh.

But the defendant on one pretext or another delayed the payment of dower and finally on 10.12.1988 refused to pay it.</p><p><strong>Judgment</strong></p><p>Moreover, the whole purpose of the 1974 Act, as derived from the preamble, is to consolidate the registration of Muslim marriages and divorces under one   Act and not to diversity the registration of different parts of marriage contract under different Acts, e.g. dower under some other Act. The dower in a Muslim marriage forms an inseparable part of the terms of the terms of the Kabinnama and thus as the Kabinnama is intended to be registered under the 1974 Act, so is the dower.The Act of 1974 is, in our opinion in force relating to the registration of Muslim marriage including dower.</p><p><strong>Case:4</strong><i></i></p><p><i>Muhammad Taqui khan v. Farmodi Begum<b></b><br/></i></p><p>In the present case, we have found that the plaintiff had asked her husband for the payment of her entire dower and the husband had definitely refused to entertain her claim in any shape or form and had referred her to a suit. In these circumstances it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to make a fresh demand later on when she decided to file the suit and under advice received decided to reduce her claim to half the amount of dower.</p><p><strong>Facts</strong></p><p>The plaintiff, Mt. Farmoodi Begam, a Pathan lady of Shajahanpur, was married to Mohammad Taqi Ahmad Khan, a Pathan, resident of Shajahanpur, on 24th June 1908. By this union a number of children were born and two grown-up daughters are now living. In April 1934 some differences, apparently of a trivial nature, arose between the husband and wife and, after a married life of over 25 years, the plaintiff left her husband’s home and has brought this suit for recovery of Rs. 40,000 against him. Her case, shortly stated, is that at the time of marriage her dower was fixed, “without any specification, at a sum of Rs. 80,000 and two dinars” and that by a custom prevailing in the family and amongst the Pathans of Shajahanpur half of this is to be treated as prompt and. half as deferred. Her husband refuses to pay this sum or any other sum and she is entitled to recover the same by an action at law against him. The defendant denied the lady’s dower to be Rs. 80,000 and he alleged that it was only Rs. 15,000. He further alleged that the lady had agreed to remit the whole of her dower and while leaving the defendant’s home she had taken a large amount of cash and ornaments and had thus paid herself off if she had any claim for dower. The custom pleaded by the lady was also denied and it was further contended that no valid demand for the payment of dower had been made and the lady had no cause of action for the suit. The trial Court found against the plaintiff on the issue of custom. It found against the defendant on the issue of the amount of dower, remission of dower and of its payment. On the issue whether a demand had been made previous to the suit or not it expressed no decided opinion, having taken the view that the present plaint itself could be treated as a demand. It further found that 1/5th of the dower should be treated as prompt and the remaining deferred. Accordingly it granted the plaintiff a decree for Rs. 16,000 with interest from the date of the suit. Against this    judgment and decree, the plaintiff and the defendant have appealed and these two appeals are now before us for consideration.</p><p>Some matters were in controversy in the Court below which are no longer in dispute before us. It is now conceded that the dower of the lady fixed at the time of marriage was “RS. 80,000 and two dinars without any specification,” that no portion of it has been remitted or paid off and that there exists no custom according to which a proportion could be fixed as to bow much of it was prompt and how much deferred and it is for the Court to determine the amount of prompt dower according to law. The questions which have been argued before us are largely questions of law, namely whether the plaintiff has got any cause of action and whether any portion of the lady’s dower can be treated as prompt and, if so, how much.</p><p>The defendant contends that previous to the filing of the suit the plaintiff had in fact made no demand for payment of her dower and the demand set up by her is invalid in law. Further, that the plaintiff has no right to recover prompt dower after consummation of marriage and that the amount awarded to her by the trial Court as prompt dower is unduly excessive. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that the amount awarded to her by the trial Court is unduly inadequate and 1/3rd of her dower should be treated as prompt. At the very outset it is necessary to determine the question of fact whether a demand for payment of dower was in fact made by the lady before she raised the action. In Para1 of the plaint inters alia the plaintiff alleged:</p><p>Since about a month the plaintiff has been compelled to demand repeatedly her prompt dower debt from the defendant. But he always put forward excuses and ultimately he refused to pay, hence this suit.</p><p>In Para 2 the plaintiff alleged:</p><p>The cause of action for this suit arose on or about 23rd September 1934 when the defendant refused to pay for the last time in Shajahanpur.</p><p>1. In her sworn statement in the suit dated 23rd January 1935 she stated as follows:</p><p>I demanded my dower debt Rs. 80,000 and two surkh dinars through my cousin Fazal Ahmad Khan. In reply to the same he (the defendant) asked me to file the suit.</p><p>2. The lady was not cross-examined on this point. The husband gave evidence and did not controvert this statement. At the same time, Fazal Ahmad Khan was not called at the trial, nor was any further evidence tendered, oral or documentary, in support of this demand. The learned Counsel for the defendant contends that this is all interested testimony and wholly unreliable and legally inadmissible. We do not think so. At the time of filing of the plaint the plaintiff and her advisers were fully conscious of the fact that a demand and refusal was necessary for the purposes of the claim. They say so in the plaint that demand was repeatedly made and refused. There was absolutely no reason to invent this false statement. Time was not running out, there were no other compelling reasons and it would have been the easiest thing in the world if this statement had been untrue to issue a written demand and to file the action a few days later. The defendant, as we have noted above, did not admit the amount of dower and did not further admit that any dower was due and not paid off. In the circumstances, it is very natural that he would not be in a mood to entertain any claim for dower on the part of the lady and would naturally refer her to a suit. We therefore are of opinion that there is no good reason why the lady’s Statement on this part of the case should not be accepted in its entirety.</p><p>3. The next matter is whether this demand was sufficient and valid in law. The dower of the lady at the time of marriage was fixed at Rs. 80,000 and two dinars without any specification. There was no agreement between the parties and no custom exists under which it can be determined how much of it was to be treated as prompt and how much deferred and this apportionment has to be made by a decree of Court after a trial. Where the amount of dower to be treated as prompt is to be assessed by a decree of Court after contest, is it absolutely essential for the success of the claim to make a previous demand and if so in what terms? Whether the demand should be wholly dispensed with or whether it should be of a general nature for settlement of the claim without fixing or specifying any amount or whether an exaggerated and extravagant demand is permissible even up to the entire amount of the dower or whether the demand should be a reasonable and bona fide one? These were some of the questions which were debated at great length before us.</p><p>4. The defendant contends that in a claim for prompt dower under Mahomedan law, a previous demand and refusal by the plain, tiff is a part of the plaintiff’s cause of action. A dower debt is one of those obligations in which a creditor has to seek his debtor and not the debtor his creditor and if a valid and proper demand has not been made antecedent to the suit the action is bound to fail for want of a cause of action. The defendant further contends that in a case where prompt dower is not fixed by agreement under custom and has got to be fixed by Court no valid and proper demand can be made till the amount is fixed and therefore an action would not lie at all for the recovery of prompt dower and a dower therefore in such a case must be taken to be a deferred dower. Alternatively, he contends that a plaintiff must, before raising the action, fix up a bona fide and reasonable amount as her prompt dower and demand the same before filing a suit to recover it and an exaggerated demand embracing the entire amount of dower can never be a valid demand for a claim of half the amount of dower which later on the plaintiff decides to bring in Court. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that dower debt is like any other money, a debt with a promise to pay an demand, and in a case like this the demand is not an essential part of a cause of action. An action for recovery of debt would lie without making a previous demand. The basic principles which govern these contentions have been the subject of discussion by high judicial authority. In a Full Bench decision in Nawab Bahadoor Jung Khan v. Mt. Uzeez Begum (1843-46) S.D.N.W.P. 180 (F.B.) the nature of prompt dower is explained as follows:</p><p><strong>Judgment</strong></p><p>Nevertheless the Court consider the nature of the eligible dower to be that of a debt payable generally on demand after the date of the contract, which forms the basis of the obligations and payable at any period during the life of the husband, on which that demand shall be actually made, and therefore until the demand be actually made and refused, the ground of an action at law cannot properly be said to have arisen, nor the law of limitation become applicable. The Court remark that in an ordinary bond for debt, the lender has stipulated or demanded to be repaid on the particular date specified in the bond, and there is an actual infraction of the agreement equivalent to refusal of the requirement to repay should the debtor fail to liquidate the loan on the stipulated date ; and here clearly commences the ground of an action in Court for recovery of that which is due; but in the case of an obligation to pay on demand, such as the Court regard the obligation to pay the exigible dower to her, there is no infraction of the obligation until the demand be made and refused, and consequently no cause of legal suit has arisen.</p><p>The previous demand of this lesser sum and refusal in this case is not an integral part of the plaintiff’s cause of action. Her real cause of action is the refusal on her husband’s part to co-operate in determining the amount of prompt dower and such a suit, in our opinion, cannot fail simply because a previous demand had not been made for the payment of the precise sum which was claimed in the plaint. In our opinion, the demand which we have found above the plaintiff to have made was quite sufficient to satisfy the condition if demand be taken to be an essential part of the cause of action. In this view, it is not necessary to express an opinion upon a point decided in the plaintiff’s favor by the trial Court, namely that the plaint in the present action can be treated as a demand and whether the rule laid down in Simpson v. Routh (1824) 2 B &amp; Cr. 682 at p. 537 is applicable to the case. The other matter for consideration is what is the effect of  consummation of marriage on the right of the wife to recover her prompt dower.</p><p><b>Case:5</b></p><p><i>Moulana Md.Zakaria Khan v Mst.Momtaz Khanam and another</i></p><p>In this cases, the plaintiff petitioner Md.Zakaria Khan filed a suit on 9.9.1967</p><p>being other suit No 119 of 1967 against the defendants opposite parties for</p><p>restitution of conjugal rights payment of prompt dower to the wife is a condition precedent to husbands claim for restitution of conjugal rights.</p><h3>Fact</h3><p>The plaintiff petitioner filed a suit on 9.9.67 being other suit No.119 against the Defendants opposite parties for restitution of conjugal rights along with a prayer Of injunction against defendant opposite party No.2 salamat Ali directing him not to interfere with their conjugal life and also not to give the opposite party no:1 is the legally married wife of the plaintiff petitioner. The marriage ceremony took place in March,1965 and a son was born to them on 25.3.1966.The opposite party No.1 along with the minor son was taken to her father’s house for Naiyor with a promise to send her back to the petitioner house within 15 days. On the expiry of this period, however, the opposite party No.1 did not come back. Thereafter various attempts were made to bring her back to her husband’s house. Thereafter on 25.8.67 the petitioner sent a pleader’s notice requesting her to come to his house within seven days. But she did not comply with that notice on 13.9.67 claiming Rs.5520/ on account of her dower, maintenance etc.So the plaintiff petitioner filed the present suit on 9.9.67 for restitution of his conjugal rights.</p><p><b>Judgment</b></p><p>The trial court is therefore directed to proceed with the suit and try the same in</p><p>Accordance with law. The trial court<b> </b>will however, be not debarred in pronouncing a judgment and decree as is unusually done in similar case by observing that the decree if any for restitution of conjugal rights will be operative on deposit of payment of the unpaid prompt dower money, if any is due. Both the parties including the defendants opposite parties also will not be debarred in paying for analogous hearing of both the suits before the appropriate court in case they succeed in registering the proposed suit for which the application in forma paupers is pending in the 1<sup>st</sup> court of Munsiff, sadder Chittagong which numbered as Miscellaneous case No.179 of 1967 and order accordingly.</p><p>Lastly we say that, this case focus clearly that payment of prompt dower to the  wife  is a condition precedent to husband’s claim for restitution of conjugal.</p><p><b>Conclusion:</b></p><p>The legal position as regards the issue of dower remains the same in Bangladesh as it was after independence from Pakistan. It has been argued that the division of dower into prompt and deferred creates anomalies and sometimes reduces the amount of dower if the husband can falsely prove that the prompt dower has been paid. In the Pakistan period, the dowers which were not specified were regarded as to be realized in full on demand under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961. This is still the law in Bangladesh.</p></div></div>
9175	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE CONCEPT AND USEFULNESS OF THE COLOUR TRADEMARK AND THE MERE COLOUR RULE</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><div><p>INTRODUCTION:</p><p>The colour palette offers not just the seven colours of rainbow but a wide variety of shades to be spoilt for choice. As Coco Chanel said, “Women think of all colors except the absence of color. I have said that black has it all. White too. Their beauty is absolute. It is the perfect harmony”. Not adhering to the gender specific perspective of the quote, colours do have it all in the fashion world- distinctiveness and well, exclusive rights too.</p><p>Product colour, specially in the fashion world can be of utmost importance to the brand, classic examples of the same being Christian Louboutin and their red lacquered outsole, Tiffany and their Tiffany blue box and even the famed fashion doll Barbie and everything Barbie in a shade of pink. Imparting exclusive rights to colours has always been a tricky concept.</p><p>Colour trademarking is the concept of registering and reserving a particular colour for a particular brand. It is one of the most prominent non-conventional trademark and rather a very important one in the fashion world.</p><p>A trademark is usually the first to be noticed and the last to be forgotten by consumers and in this era of ever raising consumerism, a trademark’s unique feature to distinguish between products and services. Trademarks do help associating certain attributes to a particular brand and do speak volumes about quality, origin and publicity. Even though all of the above are true, a trademark is not meant for granting monopoly to a certain brand. With consumerism growing perpetually and numbers of brands growing in geometric progression, there is bound to an outburst of litigation from companies trying to outdo each other. The traditional trademarks are easy to justify- words, pictures, logos- unique and exclusive. The non-conventional trademarks have it harder. Non-conventional trademarks include colour, shape, sounds, scent and even taste and justifying these get difficult and even if they are, setting the extent till which it needs to be justified gets even more difficult. Among all the yet identified trademarks, the colour trademark is the one in greatest demand.</p><p>The colour trademark argument arguably started in 1975. [1]Even though a baby step, it was held by the UK House of Lords that a colour scheme covering the entire surface of a product (a medicinal pill in this case) can be registered as a trade mark.[2] The main reason behind the same was the fact that the colour scheme prevented confusion in the mind of consumers and added distinctiveness. With the enactment of EU’s Trademark’s Directive in 1988 and the enactment of Community Trade Mark regulation 1993, the UK Trademarks Act 1994[3] was adopted. With the adoption and enactment of these, the European Court of Justice became the first court to address the issue of non-conventional trademarks. Quality, origin and publicity form some of the basic reasons why a unique trademark is necessary. Even though it is never the aim of a trademark to let traders gain monopoly in the market, companies often use them as a tool to help them set a restraint on competition. Not the most ideal but definitely the most used practice. Also, the fact that most of the visual information we tend to intake is colour, the importance of colour in the commercial space gets more aggravated.</p><p>With colour being one of the most important feature of a fashion commodity and the first attribute a consumer notices in an item, colour becomes attached to one particular brand.</p><p>ENFORCEABILITY OF A SINGLE COLOUR TRADEMARK: PRESENT SITUATION AND HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</p><p>Testing the enforceability of a trademark hasn’t been an easy task. A number of questions pertaining to non-conventional trademarks were answered in the ruling of the landmark case <em>Ralf Sieckmann v Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt</em>[4]whichgave rise to the now famous Sieckmann Seven fold test. In the same famous case, it was held by the judge that a trademark may comprise of a sign which is fundamentally incapable of being perceived visually but it is valid if it can be duly represented graphically through images and characters with clear and well-defined lines.</p><p>Traditionally, it had been held by the Courts that a single colour cannot effectively function as a trademark. This has been embodied in the rule called the “single colour rule” which was enacted as early as the 1906 and has acted as the single largest deterrent for the registration of a single colour trademark in fashion. Reasons cited for the same includes shade confusion, adequate protection provided by colour in design and traditional approach towards colour. The colour depletion theory came in much later yet much stronger.</p><p>The case on this which gathered a colossal amount of publicity is one between fashion giants Christian Louboutin and Yves Saint Laurent, and Tiffany’s little cheer leading spree in the form of an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief on the same.</p><p>Christian Louboutin, the brand, is fashion royalty and their signature red outsole an absolute symbol of class. To consider the red outsole as just another attribute in a regular shoes character would be highly unjust. Christian Louboutin is known for its red soles. Christian Louboutin was born in 1963, he actually started dreaming of footwear during his teenage market. He was expelled from school at 16 and he worked for the famed designer Charles Jordan. Come early 1990s, he launched his own footwear line. In 1993, the iconic red lacquered outsole shoes was launched. It is famously reported that Christian Louboutin discovered his passion on a trip to the museum. He is famously quoted as being utterly fascinated by the shoes and that he has never seen something like that. He is also said to have been inspired by a book of Roger Vivier’s designs, who designed shoes for Christian Dior in the 1950s. Louboutin set up his shop in Paris in 1990s and he happened to not be dissatisfied with the shoes manufactured. His assistant happened to sit there and paint her nails, which the designer took and painted the sole of the shoe. What started years ago as the nail polish accident (which I’d prefer to call innovation and not accident) and a vision to curate women’s heels to make them feel confident, Louboutin heels are nothing short of an icon in the fashion world.</p><p>Louboutin has been famously quoted that red outsoles are supremely flirtatious and his customers never let him stop.</p><p>Tiffany is probably the most iconic jewellery brand and it all started when Charles Lewis Tiffany and his friend John B Young decided to open a fancy good store in New York City was the $1000 given by Charles’ father. Tiffany boasts of classic American jewellery and it caters to fashionable ladies who came to Broadway searching for fashionable and contemporary pieces of jewellery, in contrast to extravagant pieces typical of the Victorian era. Tiffany even went ahead to win the grand prize for silver craftsmanship at the 1867 World Fair in Paris. Ever since then, Tiffany has firmly etched itself in not just fashion but history books. The 1961 cult movie <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s </em>catapulted the brand to pop culture. Not only Tiffany’s iconic jewels but Tiffany’s iconic robin’s egg shell blue boxes have achieved iconic box over the years. Tiffany’s blue itself, best described as robin’s egg-shell’s blue, has been used on Tiffany’s boxes for more than a century. Tiffany’s timeless pieces cannot be imagined in a box in a colour other than Tiffany’s blue and it will be rather apt to conclude that the colour has got itself attached to the brand. Tiffany has been one of the forerunners in the field of colour trademark with the colour robin’s egg-shell’s blue being used for boxes and packets since 1845. [5]Having been used this extensively, the colour is now better known as Tiffany blue.</p><p>Another colour which has attained iconic status is the Barbie pink. So intrinsically attached it is with the brand that Barbie pink is the best way to describe the Pantone 219C. The pink Barbie packets have it expressly mentioned- “Mattel owns the colour Barbie pink” and it has been a forever struggle on the part of Mattel to wipe out other similarly fashioned fashion dolls in hot pink-meets-fuschia packets.</p><p>Christian Louboutin’s red lacquered outsole has assumed iconic status over the years. It’s distinctive and it reflects the vision of the designer who has conceptualized this design for 27 years. From a generalised point of view, it would be nothing short of injustice if Christian Louboutin’s red lacquered outsole is not granted protection and if the market is flooded with red outsole-d shoes from other brands. Louboutin himself has been quoted saying – “For 26 years, the red sole has enabled public to attribute the origin of the shoe to its creator, Christian Louboutin.”[6] The red outsole was granted federal registration in2008. Barely 3 years later, in April 2011, Christian Louboutin filed a suit against Parisian fashion giant Yves Saint Laurent for trademark infringement rooting from YSL’s use of red outsoles on its shoes as part of the monochrome shoes available in different shades including Yves Saint Laurent’s Tribute, Tribtoo, Palais and Woodstock. Right as Yves Saint Laurent released this line of shoes, Christian Louboutin filed a trademark infringement suit against Yves Saint Laurent in April 2011 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. As per Christian Louboutin, YSL was liable under the Lanham Act for claims inclusive of trademark infringement and counterfeiting, false designation of origin, unfair competition and trademark dilution. A preliminary injunction preventing Yves Saint Laurent from marketing its monochrome red shoe, was also sought. In response to the same, Yves Saint Laurent filed a counterclaim seeking cancellation of Christian Louboutin’s red sole trademark on grounds of lack of distinctiveness and that it was too functional to obtain trademark protection.</p><p>CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN V YVES SAINT LAURENT: THE CASE TIMELINE</p><p>At the District Court, Christian Louboutin’s motion for preliminary injunction was denied by District Judge Victor Marrero, on grounds of Louboutin failing to establish the merits of the case because of single colour marks are functional and hence, ineligible for a registered trademark.[7] Christian Louboutin filed to appeal the district court’s decision. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals, however maintained that the fashion industry was exempted from the Supreme Court’s stand on the protectability of a single colour. Based on these, trademark protection was expressly denied to Christian Louboutin’s Trademark for “contrasting” red sole. The Second Circuit was primarily focused on the defence of functionality taken by Yves Saint Laurent. Citing the classic case of Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159 (1995), the Second Circuit mentioned that the Supreme Court expressly forbade the <em>per se </em>rule against protection of a single colour as a trademark in a specific industry. The Second Circuit gave due attention to the fact that the Louboutin Red Sole has attained secondary meaning in the consumer psyche. Louboutin’s media coverage, consumer surveys were strictly scrutinised to analyse the same. Even though it is beyond doubt that Louboutin has a very strong effect on the consumer psyche and the red sole is inherently attached to the Louboutin label, the appeals court held that- “Louboutin’s failure to show that the secondary meaning of its Red Sole Mark extended to uses in which the sole did not contrast with the upper part of a shoe (i.e., on monochromatic red shoes). For example, of the hundreds of pictures of Louboutin shoes submitted to the district court, only four were monochrome red. YSL, on the other hand, had produced evidence of its sale of monochromatic red shoes, as well as other monochromatic coloured shoes since the 1970’s.” The Second Circuit further went on to add that Louboutin’s Red Sole’s Trademark is valid only when it contrasts in colour with the upper part of the shoe and ordered the U.S Patent and Trademark Office to do the same.[8]</p><p>The war between these two fashion giants remain one of those landmark cases which establish the importance of secondary meaning and how because of the same, even a single colour can function as a trademark in the fashion industry. Though it can be argued that Christian Louboutin’s contrasting red is its distinguishing mark, but there are shoes from the house of Christian Louboutin whose colour exactly do not adhere to the concept of “contrast”.</p><p>The never ending saga between these two fashion giants got little more interesting when luxury jewellery giant Tiffany &amp; Co. filed an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief in support of Christian Louboutin and in the words of Harley Lewin, the lawyer for Tiffany &amp; Co.- “We are enormously pleased that Tiffany has weighed in,”.[9] He went on to add that Tiffany has agreed with Louboutin’s arguments and has put forward arguments thus strengthening the case. Tiffany even contended that the court appeared to have relied on generalities about the fashion industry and analysing whether the use of single colour can be considered “functional” on fashion items.</p><p>While exclusivity and brand identification remains the basic arguments in favour of trademarking colours, sceptics and a section of legal professionals alike have arguments.</p><p>The most (in)famous rule against trademarking a single colour remain the colour depletion theory. The colour depletion theory is based on the concept that the number of colours in the universal colour palette is limited and reserving one colour for one brand will only deplete the available palette of colours. This theory was first articulated in the now famous Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour &amp; Co., 81 F. Supp. 114 (E.D. Pa. 1948)[10] in which the plaintiff Campbell &amp; Carnation was denied the use of their signature red and white stripes on grounds of colour depletion. However, the <em>Owens-Corning </em>court acknowledged in a ruling pertaining to the use of single colours as trademarks that the <em>per se </em>prohibition of the colour depletion theory conflicts with the liberating nature of the Lanham Act of the US. This is a direct revoke on the part of the colour depletion argument. The colour depletion theory, according to modern jurists, is erroneous because of the very fact that it presumes that the visible spectrum is finite and limited. Trademark owners and transnational market participants were sceptical about the usage of reserving one colour for a particular product, and wanted widely used colours to remain in the public realm. Colour depletion, as a concept, is arguably not a huge issue for local markets, it can cause a huge uproar and a plethora of litigations in the transnational market, because of the huge number of competitors and their rat race for colour branding.</p><p>Talking about the concept of colour depletion with respect to the Louboutin case, the red which was asked to be trademarked was found unsuitable for protection. The Supreme Court, had previously held, in the <em>Qualitex </em>case[11] that the colour depletion theory is reliant on a sporadic problem for a finding a perpetual solution. The <em>Qualitex </em>case was a result of 1980s liberalization of markets when world trade and foreign direct investment was the order of the day. So litigious was the atmosphere with respect to trademarks that in the mid 90s, it was estimated that intangible assets like trademarks amounted for almost half the net worth of the company.</p><p>The <em>Qualitex </em>decision was reached in 1994 after a decade of discord among federal circuit courts. The Supreme Court finally granted certiorari to resolve the matter and arrive at a decision for the green-gold trademarks for press pads in use in the dry cleaning industry.</p><p>In Louboutin’s case as well, the Court opined that Louboutin’s red, if protected, will be detrimental to other designers and that Louboutin only will have the right to paint a full palette. This, in time, will limit, the creative freedom of other designers.</p><p>Again, analysing this concept, we find that Louboutin exactly did not claim the colour “red”. It claimed protection on the red lacquer outsole. The red they claim is limited to the outsole of their iconic shoe and it’s not commonplace to find red outsoles on every other shoe. The secondary meaning which has come to be attached with the red outsole was also not acknowledged. Also, it has been extensively argued that the colour depletion theory has very little scientific basis. There are not a handful but millions of different colours distinguishable to the human eye. Again, if a manufacturer is restricting itself to just one shade of a spectrum, it is the opposite of colour depletion.</p><p>SHADE CONFUSION THEORY</p><p>Theories of Shade Confusion have also backed the idea of not registering of non-conventional trademark, namely, the colour trademark. Shade confusion theory, however, in the opinion of a number of scholars, is nothing specific to a colour trademark. The magnitude of confusion with respect to shades of colour is the same as that of a word. Hence, this should not ideally act as a deterrent to the registration of colour trademarks. The Court, in <em>Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products</em> Co., 514 U.S. 159 (1995), the defendant’s shade confusion argument was rejected by the Court on the same grounds. The logic of shade confusion is flawed on various grounds, one of them being the fact that if shade confusion is considered one of the real problems why colours should not be trademarked, then colours shouldn’t be used in trademarks at all. Shade confusion theory is derived from the concept that colours and different shades of colours can easily lead to confusion, which in modern mercantile scenario, is considered vague. A couple of centuries ago though, call it lack consumer awareness or otherwise, it would have been an issue but consumer awareness has increased in geometric progression over the years. However, the basic argument which was applied in yesteryears was that close shades of pantone would create confusion both for trademarking purposes and in the minds of consumers. Therefore, they would fail to survive the basic purpose of the trademarks, which is imparting and enforcing uniqueness of products. The Courts have also strongly criticised this theory and went to the extent of saying that the courts, if required, will create the same lighting conditions under which the product is sold.</p><p>THE FUNCTIONALITY TEST</p><p>Next comes the Functionality clause. The functionality argument is based on the concept that the natural colour of a product cannot be legally protected because that would be unfair to other competitors in the same market. Though unrelated to fashion, a popular example is the <em>John Deere </em>tractor. Unlike myths, <em>John Deere </em>does not own green. Green happens to be a functional colour. Non-functionality is another requirement for the successful protection of any trademark colour. The concept of functionality has extended from utilitarian to aesthetic. As per the Lanham Act, trademark registration is prohibited for any mark that comprises of any matter that is functional as a whole. [12]For a trademark to be valid, it needs to be both non-functional as well as source identifying. A feature is considered functional if it’s mandatory for the use of the article or if the cost or quality of the item is affected by the same. As worded by the Supreme Court, the functionality test depends on whether the exclusive feature of the item would substantially disadvantage the competitors. Justifying the functionality of colour poses to be another challenge when deciding whether a certain colour is eligible for a trademark. With respect to Louboutin, aesthetic functionality was a hugely debated topic at the courts. The doctrines of functionality and aesthetic functionality have both been discussed in the 1982 case of <em>Inwood laboratories</em>[13]<em>. </em>As already hinted, the doctrine of functionality debars certain product features from being protected if they are essential to the use or purpose of the commodity or if they affect the cost or quality of the article. In case of Louboutin, it can be argued that the red sole does add to the value of the article. However, the doctrine does not apply to the pink packaging of the famed fashion doll from Mattel- Barbie.</p><p>Functionality can be utilitarian, aesthetic or communicative. According to the concept of utilitarian functionality, the features which tend to serve a utilitarian purpose are not granted trademark protection. Utilitarian functionality was well defined by the Supreme Court in the 2001 case <em>TrafFix Devices, Inc v Marketing Displays, Inc.</em>[14] which revolved around if dual-spring mechanism to permit signs to withstand strong winds was functional and hence not eligible for trademark. Another popular example being John Deere and their ownership on the colour green. True, the yellow deer with the green background is trademarked but John Deere does not own green due to basic principles of functionality. Aesthetic functionality debars those aesthetic feature from being trademarked which has an important role to play in the commercial success of a product. Communicative functionality is quite similar, though. It indicates the use of a product feature which is used to communicate non-source related meanings.</p><p>ANALYSIS OF THE ENFORCEABILITY OF SINGLE COLOUR TRADEMARK: THE LOUBOUTIN PERSPECTIVE</p><p>Coming back to Louboutin, the red outsole took its birth in a bit of a controversy. Louboutin’s vision was to create a pair of shoes that will make women feel confident and empowered. Like his muse, the shoes needed to ooze class, confidence and eminence. It all happened on a quaint afternoon when a shoe inspired by Andy Warhol’s ‘Flowers’ arrived and Louboutin found it to be dull and unappealing. As already mentioned, an assistant was painting her nails in a shade of red, when Louboutin probably had a brilliant brainstorm and he grabbed the nail paint and painted the sole of the shoe, red. With what is now known as the nail polish accident, the iconic shoe was born. Christian Louboutin, the now shoe mogul, sells more than five hundred thousand pairs a year and Louboutin shoes are considered a symbol of class. This is just a brief part of the history which gave birth to the iconic red shoes. Adding to this, the vision and the inspiration behind Louboutin remains and not considering these while deciding whether to trademark the red colour or not, does not do enough justice to the designer. [15]</p><p>The secondary meaning comes to play here. That red on the outsole was a result of years of hard work and inspiration and careful culmination of artistic sensibilities. Grouping this with just another “red” does not do justice to Louboutin’s ideologies. Of late, Christian Louboutin has even launched other products including cosmetics in the same shade of red. Additionally, this idea has been around for so many years that any other footwear from any other brand with the same attributes would necessarily create identity confusion in the mind of consumers. Christian Louboutin has seeped into popular culture, with pop diva Jennifer Lopez sings in her song “Louboutins” – “I would like a shiny new pair of Louboutin shoes. You know, the ones with the high heels and red bottoms.” Red outsoles in Louboutin shoes possess that value in the minds of consumers. A red bottomed shoe equates with Louboutin.</p><p>Coming back to the case and the court-room drama that hence ensued, the judge denied the request for injunction and mentioned that colour in the fashion industry has certain aesthetic functions pivotal to competition, hence making it unlikely for Louboutin that the brand is entitled for copyright protection. True, the Louis Vuitton logo or the Burberry check has been duly trademarked. Louboutin went on to mention that it has been the first to commercially use a red lacquered outsole to which the opponent retorted that red outsoled shoes have previously bene seen on King Louis XIV and more recently on celluloid when Dorothy swayed in ruby slippers in “The Wizard of Oz”.</p><p>The judge drew an analogy between fashion and art and spoke of a hypothetical case between legendary painters Picasso and Monet. Picasso’s Blue phase in which he painted in shades of blue with occasional bursts of other colours is legendary. Monet’s “Water lilies” are equally famous. According to the Judge, it would be erroneous to grant Picasso monopoly over the colour blue. The Judge also took up the fictitious case in which Picasso decided to sue Monet for the use of the same shade of blue in “Water Liles” as he has extensively used in his Blue Period. Whether fashion can be equated with art or not is again a concept with varied opinions. Fashion, in my opinion, is necessarily, an intertwined but different concept. With movements like #wearyourart and fashion being considered an extension of the art form, the Judge’s analogy cannot be brushed off.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>With all the legal developments around the issue of colour trademark, it is yet difficult to arrive at a definitive conclusion on the same. Any trademark needs to be fundamentally distinctive, that is a pre requisite and in many a cases including the iconic Louboutin shoes, most brands adhere to the requirement, be it Tiffany’s blue or Cadbury’s purple. After the landmark case of <em>Qualitex </em>, it can be safely concluded that a certain colour may serve as a product, provided the colour is not <em>de jure </em>functional. Certain concepts still remain unclear though and with Louboutin’s legacy, what exactly were the obstacles in successfully registering a trademark. The requirements for registration of trademarks, conventional or not are still undergoing further developments, around the world. For instance, India does not expressly provide for single colour trademarks, but it is hinted at by the guidelines from the Trade Mark Office that single colour trademarks would soon be enforced. Spain does not traditionally allow the registration of single colour trademarks and there are instances of such rejection before. The Israeli Trademark Law, however, expressly acknowledges single colour registration. Malaysia, however, does not expressly provide single colour trademark registration but it does say that colour is one of the important factors to be taken into account while considering the registration of a trademark. New Zealand’s Trade Mark Act 2002 mentions colour as one of the “signs” which is included in the definition of a registrable trademark. Canada’s laws does not allow registration of colour <em>per se, </em>except if it is part of a shape or design.</p><p>In light of these, this can at least be safely concluded that trademark for colours has a long way to go. Here’s hoping that fashion royalty gets its share of trademark.</p><p>BIBLIOGRAPHY</p><ol><li>Christian Louboutin &amp; Phillipe Garcia, <em>Christian Louboutin </em>(first edition 2011, Rizzoli International Publications)</li><li>Wipo.int.

9176	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The concept of charge under the Transfer of Property Act does not transfer any interest, but the charge holder simply entitled to recover the money from the property</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“The concept of charge under the Transfer of Property Act does not transfer any interest, but the charge holder simply entitled to recover the money from the property”.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is Transfer of Property Act?</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An act has been established in case of properties and everything related to its transfers which came into force on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of July, 1882. This law is related to the modes of transferring property (sale, mortgage, lease, gift, will etc.) by the act of parties and was imposed in whole Bangladesh. “Transfer of property” means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, or to himself and one or more other living persons; and “to transfer property” is to perform such act. In this section “living person” includes a company or associations or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> It is a civil legislation of immense significance owing to the vast number of property related transactions taking place throughout the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the Transfer of Property is defined as an act by which a living person transmits property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, and one or more other living persons, and ‘to transfer property’ is to perform such act. In this section ‘living person’ includes a company or association or body of individuals, whether integrated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is essential to note the meaning of the word property as applied in the act. Property has been given a rather wide spectrum covering both tangible material things, e.g., land and houses as well as rights which are not exercised over any material, e.g., a right to repayment of a debt. The word ‘transfer’ in the Act has also been used in a wide sense. It may stand for either transfer of all the rights and interests in the property or transfer of one or more of subordinate rights in the property. Thus, the expression ‘transfer of property’ may, therefore, entail either transfer of things, transfer of one or more of the rights in a thing, or transfer of a debt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every person who is competent to contract is competent to transfer property either wholly or in part. He should be entitled to the transferable property, or authorised to dispose off transferable property which is not his own. The right may be either absolute or conditional. A transfer of property may be made without writing in cases where a written document is not expressly required by law. It can be transferred either absolutely or conditionally. Such transfer can be only to the extent, and in a manner allowed and prescribed by law. The property may be movable or immovable, present or future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily implied, a transfer of property passes forthwith to the transferee all the interest which the transferor is capable of passing in the property and in the legal incidents thereof.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In case a property is transferred subject to a condition which absolutely restrains the transferee from parting with or disposing off his interest in the property, the condition is void. The only exception is in the case of a lease where the condition is for the benefit of the lessor or those claiming under him.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is the concept of charge?</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Charges are where immoveable property of one person is by act of parties or operation of law made security for the payment of money to another, and the transaction does not amount to a mortgage, the latter person is said to have a charge on the property; and all the provisions hereinbefore enclosed 3[which apply to a simple mortgage shall, so far as may be, apply to such charge]. Nothing in this section applies to the charge of a trustee on the trust- property for expenses properly incurred in the execution of his trust, 4[and, save as otherwise expressly provided by any law for the time being in force, no charge shall be enforced against any property in the hands of a person to whom such property has been transferred for consideration and without notice of the charge].</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A charge is not mortgage. In each mortgage, there is charge, but each charge is not a mortgage. Section 100 of Transfer of Property Act states that if immovable property is made as security for payment of money and if it doesn’t amount to mortgage, then the later person is said to have a charge on property. However, a charge doesn’t create an interest in the property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The rights of charge holder</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rights are—</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· For the preservation of the mortgaged property from destruction, forfeiture or sale etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· For taking sides of the mortgagor’s title to the property.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· For making his own title thereto good in opposition to the mortgagor; and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· When the mortgaged property is a renewable lease-hold, for the renewal of the lease; and may, in the nonappearance of a contract to the contrary, add such money to the principal money, at the rate of interest payable on the principal, and where no such rate is fixed, at the rate of nine per cent. per annum: Provided that the outflow of money by the mortgagee under clause (b) or clause (c) shall not be deemed to be necessary unless the mortgagor has been called upon and has failed to take proper and timely steps to preserve the property or to support the title.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where the property is by its nature insurable, the mortgagee may also, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, insure and keep insured against loss or harm by fire the whole or any part of such property; and the premiums paid for any such insurance shall be added to the principal money with interest at the same rate as is payable on the principal money or, where no such rate is fixed, at the rate of nine per cent. per annum. But the quantity of such insurance shall not exceed the amount specified in this behalf in the mortgage-deed or (if no such amount is therein specified) two-thirds of the amount that would be required in case of total destruction to reinstate the property insured.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The concept of charge holder does not transfer any interest but the charge holder simply entitled to recover the money from property</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The proprietor of any land subject to the provisions of this Act, or of any estate or interest therein, may transfer the same by executing a transfer in the prescribed form, which transfer shall, for description of the land intended to be dealt with, refer to the instrument to the land, with such further description as may be necessary, and shall contain a precise statement of the estate or interest intended to be transferred. Transfers shall be registered in the prescribed manner and transferees shall have priority according to the date and time of registration. Upon the registration of a transfer, the estate and interest of the transferor as set forth in the instrument of transfer, with all rights, powers and privileges thereof belonging or appertaining, shall pass to the transferee, and the transferee shall thereupon become the proprietor thereof and shall be subject to and liable for all requirements and liabilities to which he would have been subject and liable if he had been the former proprietor of such estate or interest. By virtue of the registration of a transfer of a mortgage or lease the right to sue upon the mortgage or lease and to recover any debt, sum of money, annuity, or damages there under (notwithstanding that the same may be deemed or held to constitute a chose in action), and all interest in any such debt, sum of money, annuity, or damages shall be transferred so as to vest the same at law as well as in equity in the transferee thereof:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that nothing in this section shall prevent a court of competent jurisdiction from giving effect to any trusts affecting the said debt, sum of money, annuity, or damages in case the transferee holds the same as a trustee for any other person.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A charge secured on land (whether a first or second charge) can only be created by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>The borrower and the lender are generally free to agree the specific conditions of the loan secured by the charge and the circumstances in which the lender can enforce the charge in order to recover the outstanding duty. It’s an agreement which gives immovable property as security for the satisfaction of a debt without transferring any interest in the property constitutes a charge by act of parties. No particular form of words is necessary case for creation of a charge. It is sufficient, if, having regard to all the conditions of the transaction. The document shows meaning to make the land security for the payment of the money mentioned therein. But there must be a clear intention to make a property security for money in present. If there is an intention to create a charge in presenting an agreement to mortgage may amount to a charge. A mere undertaking to discharge an obligation or liability is not enough if the intention to make a specified property of finance liable is absent. An agreement which gives immovable property as security for the satisfaction of a debt, or for the payment of a maintenance allowance in perpetuity, without transferring any interest in the property or an agreement by which an owner of a share in a village receives in lieu of his share a lump sum out of the revenue, constitutes a charge on the property and is not a mortgage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The following are the illustrations of charges by acts of parties:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A inherited an estate from his maternal grand-mother and executed an agreement to pay his sister B a fix annual sum out the rents of the estate; B has charges on the estate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A sued B on a promissory note. The compromise decree directed the fee of the money and further directed the B shall not dispose of his share in a factory until satisfaction of the entire decrial amount. It was held that A had a charge on the property specified.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At any time after the principal money has become due, the charge holder has a right, on payment or tender, at a proper time and place, or the mortgage-money, to require the mortgagee (a) to deliver to the mortgagor the mortgage-deed and every documents relating to the mortgaged property which are in the possession or power of the mortgagee, (b) where the mortgagee is in possession of the mortgaged property, to deliver possession thereof to the mortgagor, and (c) at the cost of the mortgagor either to re-transfer the mortgaged property to him or to such third person as he may direct, or to execute and (where the mortgage has been effected by a registered instrument) to have registered an acknowledgement in writing that any right in derogation of his interest transferred to the mortgagee has been extinguished: Provided that the right granted by this section has not been extinguished by the act of the parties or by decree of a Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A mortgage is a transfer of an interest in definite immovable property but a charge is not. In a charge no right in rem is created, but the right is rather more than a personal obligation, for it is a just ad rem, that is right of payment out of property specified, while a mortgage is a right in rem. A charge can be created by act of parties or by operation of law; but a mortgage can be created merely by act of parties. The formation of a charge does not necessarily imply the existence of a debt while it is always so in case of a mortgage. A mortgage is superior against subsequent transferees and may be enforced against a bona fide purchaser for value with or without notice, while a charge is good only against subsequent transferee with notice. A charge created by operation of law does not require registration and act of parties entails registration irrespective of the amount involved.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Act defines simple mortgage as- where, without delivering possession of the mortgaged property, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the mortgage-money, and agrees, expressly or impliedly that in the event of his failing to give according to his contract, the mortgagee shall have a right to cause the mortgaged property to be sold and the proceeds of sale to be applied, so far as may be necessary, in payment of the mortgage-money, the transaction is called a simple mortgage and the mortgagee a simple mortgagee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In easy terms a simple mortgage does not involve giving the possession of the mortgagor’s property to the mortgagee. It is beneath mutual agreement that in case of non-payment by the mortgagee to the mortgagor within the specified time, the mortgagee can cause the mortgaged property to be sold in accordance with law and have the sale proceeds adjusted towards the payment of the mortgage money.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a simple mortgage, there is a personal covenant to pay the mortgage money whereas in charge, there is no understanding to pay the money in person. Besides there is a transfer of interest in the property mortgaged, in a charge there is no such transfer. Notwithstanding this vital distinction, the section says: “The provision hereinbefore contained which apply to simple mortgage shall, so far may be, apply to charge.” In case of a simple mortgage, the charge-holder has got a right to enforce the charge by sale of the property subject to charge.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While it can vary greatly from state-to-state, once the lender on a first mortgage <a href="http://real-estate-law.freeadvice.com/real-estate-law/mortgage_matters/1289/">forecloses</a> on a property, the lender will sell the first mortgage to the highest bidder in a foreclosure auction sale. The sale proceeds will then be used to pay down any real estate taxes that are due. Once the real estate taxes have been paid, if any proceeds are left, the first loan must be paid, and then the second. If the proceeds from the auction are not enough to cover these debts, several things can happen. If the balances in the first and second loans cannot be paid off, both lenders typically have the right to sue the borrower for balances owed, plus interest and other costs. If both lenders sue the borrower and win, each will be granted a “deficiency judgment.” Such a judgment will give both lenders the legal right to garnish the borrower’s wages, seize his or her bank accounts, and place a levy against other property not exempted by state law. However, not all states allow deficiency judgments. In a state that does not allow for such a judgment, a lender’s rights to proceed against a borrower are terminated once the property is foreclosed upon. Once the foreclosure is complete, the lender may not pursue further collection activity. In addition to the above, when the first mortgage lender carries out a foreclosure sale, the second mortgage lender may also bid for the property at the time of foreclosure sale. Even after the property has been sold at auction, the second mortgage lender may pay off the required amount of money to the first mortgage holder and get the property back at the end of the “redemption” period. These last two options are attempts to recover the money the second mortgage holder has invested, although they are rarely undertaken (particularly in a weak housing market). Additionally, a second lender can also charge-off any unpaid debt after getting a part of the sale proceeds when the first loan is paid off. This means, the second lender considers the debt uncollectible, but legally, the borrower still owes the money. Therefore, if the second mortgage holder charges-off the loan while it will no longer pursue a borrower, the second mortgage holder can still sell the right to collect on the debt to a third-party collector. The third-party collector has the legal right to make continued attempts to collect the debt.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A charge gives rise to a new proprietary interest in support of the lender over the borrower’s property. In contrast to a mortgage there is no transfer of the borrower’s existing interest but the formation of a new burden upon the borrower’s ownership. This interest by way of charge appropriates the borrower’s property to the refund of the loan. In other words it entitles the lender to look to the borrower’s property should the borrower fail to pay back the loan, for instance by insisting that the property to be sold. When the loan is repaid the charge will come to an end as there is no longer any appropriation. A charge doesn’t involve the transfer of ownership, in the same way as a mortgage of unregistered title. The charge holder is deemed to have all the legal rights of a mortgagee. However, some mortgagee rights depend on possession, such as the inherent right to take possession. A charge holder doesn’t have the possession as a mortgagee. However, it is often the case that state of affairs of a charge of registered land, right a grant mortgagee, by the terms of the charge deed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>References</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“The concept of economic zone is probably the most dramatic development that has taken place under the law of the sea in the recent times”-Illustrate &amp; Explain</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as ocean-going ships were developed, the seas became a battleground, or a route to a battleground. Countries also began to claim ownership or control of oceans nearby. But it became clear that if the seas could be claimed in the same way as land territory, there was an increased potential for competition and conflict between countries. To reduce that risk, the legal concept of ‘freedom of the seas’ was developed in the early 17th century. The underlying philosophy was that the oceans were an infinite resource, and that anyone could exploit them, or uses them for travel and transport. This became generally accepted for waters outside a ‘territorial’ sea of about 3 nautical miles from land.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">International law based on freedom of the seas remained largely unchanged and unchallenged until the middle of the 20th century. But by then, many states with sea coasts realized that the relatively few countries with large naval, merchant or fishing fleets could engage in threatening or dangerous activities. They could also exploit fisheries or mineral resources such as oil, at great distances from their own shores and close to the coasts of other countries. Economic zone is a sea zone over which a state has special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources. The law of the sea sprung up namely because of the need of the 3rd world countries to try and protect their natural resources of the sea may they be living or mineral. However, the establishment of Exclusive Economic Zones (henceforth referred to as EEZ) of 200 nautical miles has instead led to a decline of sea areas which had traditionally belonged to the high seas. It resulted in the transfer of property rights for 90% of the world’s then active fisheries to coastal States, many of whom were developing island States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">New laws of the sea which have come up in the past few decades have had some very crucial consequences such as wealth redistribution, and more so for those countries who are not bordering areas rich in minerals and living resources. These mechanisms of trying to have a jurisdiction over the seas can be seen as long ago as 1958 in the Convention on the Continental Shelf which had an exploitability criterion enshrined in it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The freedom of the seas need safeguarding as it contributes to the free movement in the high seas, for both commercial and military purposes leading to lesser chances of military confrontations. Old rules need amending and new rules need to be framed to work out the passage in the new national jurisdictions. The new resource oriented international law of the sea needs has clear implications for the strategic military field, e.g. the leading military powers need room for operations and maneuvers in the sea</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is economic zone?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Law of the Sea<b>,</b> branch of international law concerned with public order at sea. Much of this law is codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed Dec. 10, 1982. The convention, described as a “constitution for the oceans,” represents an attempt to codify international law regarding territorial waters, sea-lanes, and ocean resources. It came into force in 1994 after it had been ratified by the requisite 60 countries; by the early 21st century the convention had been ratified by more than 150 countries. The concept of economic zone is also prescribed by the united nation convention under the law of the sea. An economic zone or exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is a point extending 200 nautical miles (370 km.) from a country’s low water mark, which is a point on the shoreline that may not necessarily coincide with a low tide. In this zone, the proprietary country has exclusive rights to explore, exploit, and protect the assets of the sea within that area. The exclusive economic zone, for example, makes clear that a country can drill and sell oil, or the rights to oil, within that defined area. This zone is an extension of territorial waters and the contiguous zone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Law of the Sea Convention in 1982 set up the current rule for the exclusive economic zone. Although established in the early 1980s, the convention did not go into effect until 1994. Since that time, the zones have been in effect for all coastal nations. In some cases, countries or jurisdictions without a coast may also have access to some EEZ areas.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Historical background</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The expressions “patrimonial sea”, “economic zone” or “exclusive economic zone” were first used in the early 1970s in regional meetings and organizations in Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa.[1] The claim for 200-mile offshore sovereignty made by Peru, Chile and Ecuador in the late 1940s and early 1950s was sparked by their desire to protect from foreign fishermen the rich waters of the Humboldt Current (more or less coinciding with the 200-mile offshore belt. This limit was incorporated in the Santiago Declaration of 1952 and reaffirmed by other Latin American States joining the three in the Montevideo and Lima Declarations of 1970. The idea of sovereignty over coastal-area resources continued to gain ground.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The economic zone was established on the international agreement that resulted from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which took place between 1973 and 1982. The first Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I) was held on 1952 at Geneva, Switzerland and the second one (UNCLOS II) also held on same place on 1960.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The issue of varying claims of territorial waters was raised in the UN in 1967 by Arvid Pardo, of Malta, and in 1973 the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was convened in New York. In an attempt to reduce the possibility of groups of nation-states dominating the negotiations, the conference used a consensus process rather than majority vote. With more than 160 nations participating, the conference lasted until 1982. The resulting convention came into force on November 16, 1994, one year after the sixtieth state, Guyana, ratified the treaty. In this convention most of the issues were brought in and covered like economic zone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The most dramatic development </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The economic zone is one of the most dramatic developments and consists a lot of disputes with it. The concept of the exclusive economic zone is one of the most important pillars of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. The regime of the exclusive economic zone is perhaps the most complex and multifaceted in the whole Convention. The accommodation of diverse issues contributed substantially to the acceptance of the concept and to the Convention as a whole. The 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea is often referred to as a package. The metaphor is derived from a decision made during the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea that the Convention would be adopted <i>in toto,</i> as a “package deal”. No single issue would be adopted until all issues were settled. This decision provided an essential mechanism for reconciling the varied interests of the states participating in the Conference. If a state’s interests in one issue were not fully satisfied, it could look at the whole package and find other issues where its interests were more fully represented, thereby mitigating the effects of the first. Thus, the Convention became an elaborately-constructed document built on trade-offs, large and small.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Disputes over the exact extent of Exclusive Economic Zones are a common source of conflict between states over marine waters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· One well-known example of such a dispute is the Cod Wars between the United Kingdom and Iceland.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· The South China Sea (and the Spratly Islands) is the site of an ongoing dispute between several neighboring nations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Norway and Russia dispute both territorial sea and EEZ with regard to the Svalbard archipelago as it affects Russia’s EEZ due to its unique treaty status. A treaty was agreed in principle in April 2010 between the two states and subsequently ratified, resolving this demarcation dispute. The agreement was signed in Murmansk on September 15, 2010.[2]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· The dispute over Rockall is mainly due to its effect on EEZ, not on its resources or strategic benefits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· The South China Sea (and the Spratly Islands) is the site of an ongoing dispute between several neighboring nations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Croatia’s ZERP (Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone) in the Adriatic Sea caused friction with Italy and Slovenia, and cause problems during Croatia’s accession to the European Union.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· A wedge-shaped section of the Beaufort Sea is disputed between Canada and the United States, as the area reportedly contains substantial oil reserves.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· France claims a portion of Canada’s EEZ for Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon based on a new definition of the continental shelf and EEZ between the two countries. Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon is entirely surrounded by Canada’s EEZ.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Mauritius claims EEZ for Tromelin from France and EEZ for British Indian Ocean Territory from the UK.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Northern Cyprus claims a portion of Cyprus’ EEZ overlaps with that of Northern Cyprus in the south/southeastern part of the Cyprus Island.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Cyprus claims a portion of Turkey’s EEZ overlaps with its own EEZ.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regions where a permanent ice shelf extends beyond the coastline are also a source of potential dispute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In some ways, the law of the sea has always had a tension between states supporting the doctrine of an open sea (<i>mare liberum</i>) and states that seek control over a more closed sea (<i>mare clausum</i>). This struggle has been continuous throughout the evolution of the law of the sea and many UNCLOS provisions reflect this balance between coastal state and maritime state interests.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UNCLOS provides for different maritime zones with varying substantive regimes. For instance, the coastal state has sovereignty over the territorial sea, which extends up to 12 nm from the baseline. Foreign warships must follow the conditions of Article 19 for ‘innocent passage’ if they are to navigate through the territorial seas of a coastal state. Article 25 permits the coastal state to protect itself and ‘take the necessary steps in its territorial sea to prevent passage which is not innocent.’ On the other hand, all states equally enjoy the freedom of navigation and over flight in the high seas, an area beyond national jurisdiction. Situated between these two substantive regimes is the EEZ, which is arguably the most complicated of the maritime zones in terms of regulation and enforcement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of an EEZ developed early in the course of negotiations during the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III). Asian and African states adopted the 1972 Addis Ababa Declaration recognizing the right of a coastal state to establish an EEZ up to 200 nm in which ‘the coastal state would exercise permanent sovereignty over all resources without unduly hampering other legitimate uses of the sea, including freedom of navigation, of over flight and laying cables and pipelines.’ During UNCLOS III, there was considerable debate regarding the EEZ’s legal status. Maritime powers maintained that the EEZ should have the traditional freedoms of the high seas, while coastal states argued for more rights and control over the zone.30 the result is an EEZ that is a compromise between the varying positions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UNCLOS Article 56 establishes the substantive regime of the EEZ. This maritime zone begins where the territorial sea ends and is to extend no more than 200 nm from the baseline. The coastal state has the sovereign rights for the economic exploitation and exploration of all resources in the EEZ, including, for instance, energy production. The coastal state also has jurisdiction over artificial islands and installations, marine scientific research, and the protection and preservation of the marine environment. In its regulation of the EEZ, the coastal state is obliged to give ‘due regard’ to the rights and duties of other states and must act in a ‘manner compatible’ with the Convention. It is important to note that ‘sovereign rights’ does not mean sovereignty. Other states enjoy freedoms in the EEZ similar to those of the high seas, such as navigation and over flight. Article 58 outlines the rights and duties of other states in the EEZ and mandates a similar obligation upon maritime states to have ‘due regard’ to the rights and duties of the coastal state. Thus, articles 56 and 58 strike a balance between the interests of the coastal states, and the right to the freedom of navigation of all other states. The cross-reference to Articles 88 to 115 in Article 58 applies certain high seas provisions to the EEZ, so long as they are compatible with this regime. Therefore, Article 58(2) envisions that other states may need to engage in certain non-economic, high-seas activities in the EEZ, such as hot pursuit, counter-piracy efforts, assistance and rescue missions, and the suppression of drug trafficking.[3]</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conclusion </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">International law provides a framework within which the states have to act. It must always be able to provide solutions for problems between states and normative solutions for relations between countries. The law of the sea sprung up namely because of the need of the 3rd world countries to try and protect their natural resources of the sea may they be living or mineral. However, the establishment of Exclusive Economic Zones (henceforth referred to as EEZ) of 200 nautical miles has instead led to a decline of sea areas which had traditionally belonged to the high seas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>References </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. “Part V – Exclusive Economic Zone, Article 56”. <i>Law of the Sea</i>.

9181	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The concept of floor crossing acts as a hindrance in the development of real democracy</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The concept of floor crossing acts as a hindrance in the development of real democracy: Explain and Illustrate</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Vote against the party and development of democracy are very important concept in parliamentary government. In Bangladesh in the year 1972 our constitution makers incorporated Article 70 which is designed to prevent floor crossing in the parliament. But it hinders development of pure democracy and encourages dictatorship.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Democracy means power of the people. It is regarded as a form of government in which the people rule themselves either directly or indirectly through their representatives. If the representatives have no power to vote against his/her party, though the will of the party is malafide, it does not mean democracy. It brings nothings for the country. A fundamental aim of the State is to realize through the democratic process to socialist society, free from exploitation-a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens, If the parliamentarian have no power to say about their rights which going against the parties to be afraid of losing his membership. He cannot ensure people rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a parliamentarian votes against his own party, the incident is called floor crossing. It may also said, floor crossing means to resign from one party and to join another party. So by inspecting we can say, the term floor crossing means,” voting against one’s own party in the House or parliament during the time of voting.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, the freedom or liberty of the ministers chosen by the people has been taken away by this law</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The constitution makers incorporated in Bangladesh in the year 1972 “Article 70 which is designed to prevent floor crossing in the parliament. This was an anti-defection or anti floor crossing law”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This law actually hinders the institutionalization of the parliamentary government. The primary objective of the parliamentary government is that the government is accountable or devoted to the legislature. So, the executive is always not sure whether he is going to be backed up or not and therefore it always tries to feel the rhythm of the members or tries to be more receptive. But, under the anti-defection or anti floor crossing law the government and the executive is in a place from where they can enjoy dictatorship, as there is none from the government to protest or vote against. As a result, the government as it is not going to be answerable to any of the members or legislature it can pass any unethical bill which can be harmful to the country and there is none to object or vote against.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But, we need to know the reason behind designing this law in the constitution of Bangladesh in 1972. In this essay, the background of this law, the Article 70 law, its drawbacks and the reality of Bangladesh politics and some recommendations will be discussed in brief.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As we go down the road of floor crossing in the then East Pakistan then we will know the grounds behind the Article 70 or anti floor crossing law. Before the liberation war when Bangladesh was used to be a state of the then Pakistan it was seen that members were allowed to cross the floor for their own interest. The lack of education and politically insensible people has crossed the floor. “Whenever something happened in the party which has hurt someone’s own interest he was used to cross the floor. It was a regular practice in the then Pakistan. This practice made the parliamentary system unworkable here”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Due to political factionalism in Bangladesh a frequently quoted statement is “One Bengali is one party, Two Bengalis two political parties; and three Bengalis, two political parties with dissident faction in one of them”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The absence of consistency and poor position of harmony among the members of the parties were the result of personal concern, conflict of interest, personal bias etc. Some members did not attend party meetings because lack of power. The floor crossing occurred even because someone’s spoiled relatives were sentenced or not given any good work. There are hundreds of examples of such instance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For example-</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· The name of a member was not incorporated in the local relief committee so for taking vengeance he defected or crossed the floor.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>“In the name of a school secretary and not in the name of the member of the locality money for flood affected people were sent, so a defection or floor crossing occurred”.</li><li>Out of urge some of the members crossed floors or did not attend part meetings.</li><li>A member felt that enough consideration in the Party was not given to him, so he defected or crossed the floor.</li><li>“A member was caught due to black marketing and he looked for help from the Chief Minister. When he did not get the help, he crossed the floor”.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">The coalitions and lack of agreements in between the year 1954-1958 and the self-interested nature of the members actually made point for creating the Article 70 of 1972.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ARTICLE 70 under the Constitution of Bangladesh</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Article 70 was established to check floor crossing. The disorder of the past and unfeasible conditions created by the members of the parties motivated to ascertain this provision. Under the 1972 Constitution there were mainly two conditions against floor crossing:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· If a member resigns from his party.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>If a member votes against his own party during voting time.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">But added two more conditions were added in the 4th Amendment to it to reinforce the law against floor crossing. They are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· If a member doesn’t take part in voting even though he is present in the parliament.</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>If a member goes against the will or direction of his party and does not attend the parliament at all.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Two more conditions were added in the 12th Amendment. They are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Within one political party no one can form a group</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>“If one elected member joins any other political party then it is the violation of Article 70”.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COMPARISON OF FLOOR CROSSING IN OTHER COUNTRIES</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are quite a few examples of floor crossing which helped to establish democracy</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This policy helped ANC party in South Africa, few other parties also gained seats this way. According to their policy t if an ANC MP in the National Assembly needs to cross the floor, he or she would require to depend on 30 other MPs to do the same. The small parties had difficulties doing so as they did not have that much of colleagues backing them up. Still they have the opportunity to practice floor crossing and raise their voices against dictatorship</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We can also look into Germany and Brazil. Germany was given an option that is vital to bring into the argument of European experiences, and Brazil was elected as part of South–South exchange and experience learning. Lesotho has worked on a mixed member proportional (MMP) system from its 2002 general elections. According to the rules of MMP, floor crossing in parliament is allowed “only in relation to MPs who were elected by the constituency-based ballot and not those elected through the party-list proportional representation (PR) compensatory mechanism”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. Malawi and Zambia have from their independence worked on the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During these days, the British-type FPTP system gives permission to floor crossing as members of parliament are considered each characters representing constituencies even if they belong to significant political parties. South Africa operates the PR system. Floor crossing taking place in parliament is not common in countries that practice PR system, the underlying principle being that PR would not be agreeable to floor crossing as “it is premised upon party lists rather than on individuals representing constituencies.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So here democracy can be established in oppose of dictatorship through floor crossing</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EFFECTS OF ARTICLE 70 IN BANGLADESH</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>A) Contradiction among the MPs: </i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is not allowed by the MPs to vote against party’s undemocratic decisions or object to it according to Article 70. But, in reality there is no rule against providing their suggestions in the party meetings that is set by Article 70. As because a lot of MPs do not have a proper idea on this article and do not have the courage to talk even in the party meetings. It creates such a position the good outcomes of democracy are yet to be achieved. “Many of them said in the 5th and 7th parliaments that Article 70 is authoritarian”. But why there are no steps to modify the law or to eliminate it that is still a big question. The question against the knowledge of these politicians also arises as they are not even conscious of the total purpose of Article 70. So the legitimacy of the MPs is kind of conflicting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>B) Lack of responsibility and scope of dictatorship:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is certain that there is scarcity of responsibility and huge chance of autocracy of the government in the parliament of Bangladesh. A parliamentary government should take each and every initiative assessing the characteristics of the members of the legislature to evade loosing on the floor. This norm is called the duty of a government and a dutiful government has got two main uniqueness, they are: Individual duty to the ministers and collective duty of the cabinet. But there are no requirements in Bangladesh to perform the individual duty. However there is a provision of Article 55 where the fact is stated that the cabinet has collective duties to the parliament. But, in reality Article 70 actually gives opportunity to the government to run away from this responsibility too as the cabinet is certain and secure from loosing on the floor by motion of confidence or no-confidence. Because according to researcher Halim, “no member of the majority party can vote against his own party”. So, Article 70 is allowing the government not to be dutiful and transparent to the parliament and it is also giving opportunity to the government sufficient space to perform autocracy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>C) Hindrance in the practice of rule of law:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A situation where there will be opening of discussion over a bill should be created by the rule of law. The rights to argue or debate on a proposed issue or over a proposed bill should be given to the MP’s. But, the members of the ruling party are not allowed to do this practice as Article 70 prohibits it. So, in the end no matter how improbable or undemocratic the bill is it is permitted and conceded without any difficulty. So, according to Mr. Nazrul “basically the Article 70 is making the members a puppet. Most of the times in our country the ordinance is made a week before the parliament session and in the parliament it is only approved. No debate or argument or legislative actions take place at all. So, we can never expect the rule of law to flourish under this circumstance”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>D) Contradiction in the system or constitution:</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Parliamentary government is followed in Bangladesh. According to the design of parliamentary government, the government is supposed to be accountable to the parliament or legislature. On the contrary, under the presidential government, government is not accountable to the legislature. But it is seen that according to Mr. Halim “Article 70 is blocking the system of being responsible to the legislature, so in Bangladesh we are actually not practicing the parliamentary government system. So we are in a position which contradicts with the actual Parliamentary government spirit”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOOR CROSSING LAW IN BANGLADESH: FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">How floor crossing law evolved, how it became a part and parcel and how it is causing hindrance the development of the parliamentary government and checking the implementation rule of law, has been illustrated already. Now the question comes if it creates a lot of troubles and obstacles to achieve democracy and Parliamentary government system then why are we not eliminating it. There were 14 Amendments of our constitution. But the initiative to change or remove this law was not taken by any of the government or political parties. The two-third majority vote is needed to change or remove this law and not too often we see it probably be a reason behind that. But, Bangladesh Awami League came in power in the year of 2008 with more than two-third seat. But still we can’t see any march towards eliminating or changing this law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that many MPs said that they are often in confusion whether to stand against the party’s decision or not because of Article 70 is already mentioned. As they don’t have the backbone to talk freely in the party meetings even.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another motive can be the earlier experience or the history of the then East Pakistan. It is been enlightened before how in 1954-58 the advantage of floor crossing was distorted and exploited. The inclusion of floor crossing laws in the constitution of 1972 was based upon that incident. So, perhaps the politicians are scared to witness such situation another time and therefore not eliminating this law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The last but not the least motive can be the politicians are pleased with this law. Because, under this law they can indulge into authoritarian system which can never be questioned. The Executive is not responsible to the legislator or parliament under this Article 70, so if a party wants to pass a law which is not democratic he has the authority to do it. There is no chance of the executive getting overpowered on the floor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There can be many reasons for not modifying or eliminating the anti-floor crossing law, but steady and successful government system is always more important than the system this is what we believe. In Bangladesh politicians becoming corrupted, greedy and exploiting power among the political people are common phenomena. So, get rid of the law will be unrealistic in terms of Bangladesh to eliminate this law. Eliminating this law may ignite another unfeasible situation and the government may fall and no stability which we witnessed in 1954-58 maybe taking places once again. So, the prevention of floor crossing is needed for the effectiveness of the government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But according to me, a few modifications are necessary in Article 70. I think the Article 70 should allow voting on motion of confidence and money bill or passing the budget. A budget or money bill is not necessarily connected to the stability of the government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is not assumed only altering this law will make the parliament lively and effective, but at least it will help us to achieve a firm government system as well as implementing rule of law and democracy which is vital in order to have a efficient government. By modifying this law the government will not fall and still there will be some implication of rule of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ministers and political Parties, who are aware of the responsibilities to the legislation and dedicated to the duty parliament, are very much cherished by the common people of Bangladesh. That is why the Article 70 or anti floor crossing law is not needed at all. But, we all know that the political environment of the country id very much turmoil, so things would not change overnight. So, this law cannot be removed straight away. But, It is believed by us that we need to remove this law in order institute the rule of law and to witness eventual strength of Parliamentary government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bibliography</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(1) Books</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“The Concept of Floor crossing is not consistent with the principle of Freedom of Liberty”<br/></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><b>INTRODUCTION</b></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After passing the forty years of independence as a democratic nation, still our democracy is not net worth. In Bangladesh every political leaders as well as the civil and other people talks about democracy but the nation has failed to put it into practice. Parties voted into power to strengthen democracy have all failed to encourage its values. The country today is riddle with numerous problems threatening the very development of democracy. Our society with an</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under developed political culture and poverty ridden illiterate and incompetent masses is lacking democratic political organizations, institutions and practices. According to the constitution of Bangladesh a member of parliament under the ruling party can’t vote against his party which is not a practice of democracy and leading towards dictatorship. Voting for a malafide will leads to dictatorship because two third of the Member of Parliament are under the ruling party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Floor- crossing law under Bangladesh constitution:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Floor crossing means to resign from one party and to join another party. In broader sense, the term “floor crossing” refers to voting against one’s own party in the House or parliament during the time of voting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Not only that floor crossing also says that if one member is not present at the time of voting or passing a bill or doesn’t take part in the voting the member will lose his membership or seat from the parliament. This term “floor crossing” can also be called “political defection” or “side swapping”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Nazrul, “Article 70 and the future of parliamentary government”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Retrieved from- www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=parliamentary rights on voting in bangladeshconstitution&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CFcQFjAC&amp;url=http://www.thedailystar.net/law/2005/11/03/opinion1.htm&amp;ei=wlrgT4CBB8GFhQe8sbnADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwIt6e7ULV-u57lYFWaMRVJsrl5g</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. Nazrul, ““Article 70 and the future of parliamentary government”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, this law basically takes away the freedom or liberty of the ministers chosen by the people. Even if anyone wants to protest against a decision of his own party there is no option to do it. This law is found in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Malaysia etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladesh in the year 1972 our constitution makers incorporated Article 70 which is designed to prevent floor crossing in the parliament [1]. This was an anti-defection or anti floor crossing law this law basically blocs the development of the parliamentary government. The main spirit of the parliamentary government is that the government is accountable or responsible to the legislature. So, the executive is always not sure whether he is going to be supported or not and therefore it always tries to feel the pulse of the members or tries to be more responsive. But, under the anti defection or anti floor crossing law the government and the executive is in a position from where they can practice dictatorship, as there is none from the government to protest or vote against [5]. So, the government as it is not going to be accountable to any of the members or legislature it can pass any unethical bill which can be detrimental to the country and there is none to protest or vote against</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ARTICLE 70 under the Constitution of Bangladesh:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We know by now that that the Article 70 was to prevent floor crossing. The chaos of the past and the unworkable situations created by the members of the parties helped to established this provision. Under the 1972 Constitution there were mainly two conditions against floor crossing:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. If a member resigns from his party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. If he votes against his party during voting time.</p><p>4. retrieved from http://asiafoundation.org/resources/pdfs/OccasionalPaperNo11FINAL.pdf</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. Halim, “CONSTITUTION, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND POLITICS:BANGLADESH PERSPECTIVE.” P-179.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. Khan, Ataur Rahman, Two Years of Chief Ministership, (in Bengali)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But the 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment added two more conditions to it to strengthen the law against floor crossing. They are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. If a member is present in the parliament but still doesn’t take part in voting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. If a member doesn’t attend the parliament at all against the will or direction of his party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Two more conditions were added in the 12<sup>th</sup> Amendment. They are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. None conform a group within one political party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. If one elected member joins any other political party then it is the violation of Article 70.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These Amendments were to just create a situation in the parliament where the Executive has all the authority and can apply dictatorship. Here, there will be no chance of democracy. Whatever will be decided by the Executive will be final [6]. The other members among the party can’t protest. As the Executive in our country is the Prime Minister he or she doesn’t need to be accountable to the legislature he or she can do anything on his or her will power. From 1991 to till date there were four elections and right now AL is in power with more than Two-third seats of the parliament. But still there is no sign or symptom to change this Article 70 or to remove it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dictatorship:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The most general term is despotism, a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power. That entity may be an individual, as in an autocracy, or it may be a group, as in an oligarchy. Despotism can mean tyranny (dominance through threat of punishment and violence), or absolutism; or dictatorship (a form of government in which the ruler is an absolute dictator, not restricted by a constitution, laws or opposition, etc) dictatorship may take the form of authoritarianism or totalitarianism.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dictatorship is often defined simply as “not democracy”, where democracy is defined as a form of government where those who govern are selected through contested elections.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Article 70 law and dictatorship:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As floor-crossing is suppressed by the article 70 laws under the constitution of Bangladesh, it can lead to dictatorship, as the Member of Parliament can’t vote against his party, the ruling party can pass any law if they want even if it is malafide. So it’s violating the cultivation of democracy in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dictatorship is not welcome in a country which is democratic by constitution. Democracy is for the people, of the people, by the people where as dictatorship only cares about personal interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Effects of article 70 law and Floor-Crossing in Bangladesh:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Article 70 law the Mps can’t vote against partys even if it is undemocratic decision. But, they can express their opinion in team meeting because Article 70 don’t put any regulation in expressing their decision in team meeting. However, many MPs don’t have a clear idea and do not speak freely even in the party meetings. As a result the good results of democracy are yet to be achieved. This is clear sign of lack of responsibility and opportunity to dictatorship.</p><p>7.retrieved from http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/resource/articles-and-assignment/floor-crossing-law-under-bangladesh-constitution/</p><p>8.retrieved from http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/part5.htm</p><p>9. Retrieved from http://thinklegalbangladesh.com/home/article.php</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Democratic practice or power of the people should not end with the casting of a ballot. But unfortunately for us, as soon as we have elected our representative lawmaker, he is out of our hands and in the clutches of the party that nominated him. No matter how much a particular party decision might affect the interests of his constituents or push the boundaries of his conscience, a lawmaker has no real power to vote against it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The members or MPs should have their own rights to argue or debate on a proposed issue or over a proposed bill. But, the Article 70 prohibits the members of the ruling party to do this practice. So, as a result no matter how unrealistic or undemocratic the bill is it is approved and passed very easily. So, basically the Article 70 is making the members a puppet. On the other hand, under the presidential government, government is not responsible to the legislature. But as we can see that Article 70 is blocking the system of being responsible to the legislature, so in Bangladesh we are actually not practicing the parliamentary government system. So we are in a position which contradicts with the actual Parliamentary government spirit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The government asking the opposition to attend Parliament is a familiar media headline. But sadly, no party in power has taken a principled stance against Article 70, which practically renders the opposition powerless in Parliament. It means they can scream their hearts out but will never be able to vote the government down on an issue no matter how much popular support their cause might have. In a way, our Constitution, through Article 70, reiterates the old Bangla saying: “You’re invited to argue with me about who owns the <i>taal-gachh</i>, but keep in mind that the <i>taal-gachh</i> is mine!”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many MPs said that they are often in dilemma whether to stand against the party’s decision or not because of Article 70. As they are not sure they can’t even talk freely in the party meetings even. So, it can be now asked then still why these politicians are not trying to change this law?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One reason can be the past experience or the history of the then East Pakistan. I have discussed before how in 1954-58 the floor crossing advantage was misused and exploited. This was the reason behind the inclusion of floor crossing laws in the constitution of 1972. So, maybe the politicians are afraid to witness such situation again and therefore not removing this law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another reason can be the politicians are happy with this law. Because, under this law they can perform authoritarian system which can never be challenged. The Executive is not responsible to the legislator or parliament under this Article 70, so if a party wants to pass an undemocratic law he has the power to do it. There is no chance of the executive getting defeated on the floor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After so many years of democracy and with the presence of such political system, unfounded fears of “floor-crossing” are hardly any justification for holding back MPs from doing what they are mandated to do. It seems likely that without a wholesale scrapping of the provision and addressing the issue head-on, the opportunity will go missing for a vibrant parliamentary culture. A constitution without Article 70 will at least give us a fighting chance of creating a matured parliamentary system where the government is checked and balanced by its own ranks and the opposition has a genuine say in the law making process of the country</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the reason is behind not changing or removing the anti floor crossing law but still its not changed. I think Article 70 should be changed or omitted. If it’s not omitted it needs a slight change in it. There should me some criteria regarding voting. It will help us to have a stable government system as well as applying rule of law and democracy which is very important in order to achieve a responsible government. By changing this law the government will not fall and still there will be some implication of rule of law. We need responsible political parties and ministers who will be responsible to the legislation and parliament. In that case we really do not need any Article 70 or anti floor crossing law. But, as we all know the political culture of this country it will not be wise to think that this situation will change overnight. So, we can’t just</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10.

Moudud, Bangladesh : Era of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Remove this law straight away. Though, I believe to establish the rule of law and to witness ultimate spirit of Parliamentary government we need to get rid of this law. But, this is not possible in reality. At best we can change it slightly the way I mentioned in the recommendation part so that we can enjoy some democracy. The position of the MPs will also be developed if these changes can be assured. It can also be the stepping stone to be a more responsible government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CONCLUSION:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the betterment of the country and practice a fair democracy the Article 70 should be changed a little bit. Political parties or leaders can come out forward to make it possible. This will make the political leaders responsible and they will be sincere to their duty as country is depending on their voting</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bibliography:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Halim.A.(1998) “<i>Constitutional Law and Politics: Bangladesh</i>” Dhaka: P.C.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The concept of holding general meeting is to keep a check on the management. Illustrate and explain</b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After a long ‘bull market, many Bangladeshi shareholders have recently experienced their first sustained losses or negative growth. At the same time, market pressure has resulted in some corporate collapses, revealing flawed business strategies and dubious or dishonest corporate behavior. Shareholders, the wider community and our politicians have questioned the quality of Bangladeshi’s corporate governance and demanded reform to rebuild trust in the corporate sector. Improving communication is a vital initial step towards rebuilding that trust and reinforcing the quality of our corporate and market systems and practices. Improved communication between companies and their shareholders, particularly their retail shareholders, is essential if the wider community is to be convinced that the vast majority of company Directors and executives are highly-skilled and competent individuals focused on growing the wealth of shareholders. This Paper aims to be a catalyst for companies to examine the importance of AGM for shareholders and the ultimate control and destiny of a company is vested in the hands of its shareholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.0: INTRODUCTION</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meeting<b>:</b></p><p>The meeting is an assembly of persons whose consent is required for anything to decide, expressing their consent by a proper majority of votes, whether or not that thing should be done. The expression in its individual sense means a conglomeration of the meetings held in a particular sessions and sometimes is equated with the session. It is wide enough to embrace not only one sitting but all the sittings within a particular session.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Annual General Meeting:</b></p><p>It is an annual meeting of body of members. Every company is required to call at least one meeting of its shareholders each year. This meeting is known as annual general meeting. Every company whether public or private, having share capital or not, limited or unlimited must hold this meeting. The first annual general meeting of a company must be held within eighteen months from the date of its incorporation, and then no meeting will be necessary for the year of incorporation and the following year. Like for example, if a company is incorporated in January 1960, its first annual general meeting should be held within eighteen months, i.e., up to June 1961 and then no meeting will be necessary either for 1960 or 1961. Therefore, one annual general meeting must be held every year. The gap of one meeting and the next should not be more than fifteen months. The Act provides no provision for the deferment of the first AGM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An annual general meeting (commonly abbreviated as AGM, also known as the annual meeting) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeting" title="Meeting">meeting</a> that official bodies, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_association" title="Voluntary association">associations</a> involving the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public" title="Public">public</a> (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_%28law%29" title="Company (law)">companies</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder" title="Shareholder">shareholders</a>), are often required by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a> (or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution" title="Constitution">constitution</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter" title="Charter">charter</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-laws" title="By-laws">by-laws</a> etc. governing the body) to hold. An AGM is held every year to elect the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Directors" title="Board of Directors">Board of Directors</a> and inform their members of previous and future activities. It is an opportunity for the shareholders and partners to receive copies of the company’s accounts as well as reviewing fiscal information for the past year and asking any questions regarding the directions the business will take in the future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Objective of the report &amp; meeting<b>:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><b>[1]</b></a></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The object of the statutory meeting and forwarding statutory report to the member is to put the members of the company in the possession of all important facts relating to the company, what shares have been taken up, what money received, what contracts entered into and what sums spent on the preliminary expenses etc. and to provide the members an opportunity of the meeting and discussing the management, methods and prospects of the company also to approve the modification of the terms of contract named in the prospectus. A private company and a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital need not hold a statutory meeting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.1 Kind of Meetings:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>There are various kinds of meetings. They are:</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) Shareholders meeting: Means where shareholders gather together for yearly update &amp; to select board of directors for the next financial year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) Statutory meetings: Means <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/shareholder.html">shareholders</a>‘ <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/meeting.html">meeting</a> (such as an AGM) that an <a href="http://www.investorwords.com/5615/incorporated.html">incorporated</a> or <a href="http://www.investorwords.com/4125/registered.html">registered</a> <a href="http://www.investorwords.com/1967/firm.html">firm</a> must have within the specified <a href="http://www.investorwords.com/3669/period.html">period</a> under <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/corporate-legislation.html">corporate legislation</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">c) Annual general meeting: An annual general meeting or extra ordinary general meeting where in the board of directors, auditors etc are appointed, accounts and reports on the performance are announced are known as share holders meeting. This is the only occasion a share holder can interact and influence the management of a corporation</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.2 Timing:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Again, each organization should find guidance in its Constitution regarding when an AGM should take place. It does need to take place following the end of your financial year when accounts have been audited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.3 Notice of annual general meeting:<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A notice of at least 21 days</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before the meeting must be given to members unless consent is accorded to a shorter notice by members, holding not less than 95 Per cent of voting rights in the company. The notice must state that the meeting is an AGM. The time, date and place of the meeting must be mentioned in the notice. The notice of the meeting must be accompanied by a copy of the annual accounts of the company, director’s report on the position of the company for the year and auditor’s report on the accounts. Companies having share capital must also state in the notice that a member is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting and is also entitled to appoint proxies in his absence. A proxy need not be a member of that company. A proxy form must be enclosed with the notice. The proxy forms are required to be submitted to the company at least 48 hours before the meeting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.4 Committee/Board Nominations:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Your Constitution should also give guidance on electing committee or board members. It is advisable to ask for nominations before the AGM, which should be proposed and seconded. Check whether your constitution has rules about who is allowed to stand as a committee or board member.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.5 Publicity and Invitations:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is usual for organizations to be required to give advance notice of the AGM. Your Constitution may state that this notice needs to be made public, e.g. through the local newspaper, and by writing to members 21 days prior to the event. A copy of the agenda (see below) should be sent along with the invitation. Committee and Board members should attend, and normally staff and other volunteers are encouraged to attend. Invitations may also go out to clients and local decision-makers as appropriate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.6 Agenda of AGM:<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The AGM is normally conducted by the Chair of the organization. Minutes of the meeting should be taken by the Secretary. A typical AGM agenda will cover the following items:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Opening remarks/Welcome</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Apologies</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Minutes of previous AGM</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Matters arising from the Minutes</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Presentation of Annual Report (Chair/Secretary)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Adoption of Annual Report</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Presentation of Accounts (Treasurer)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Adoption of Accounts</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Appointment of Auditors/Independent Examiner</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Election of Management Committee/Office Bearers</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Motions to be put to the AGM</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Any Other Competent Business</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Closing remarks</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.7 Appointment of Auditors:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If an organization is happy with the performance of its auditors it is usual to move for adoption of the existing auditors. If for some reason there is to be a change of auditor, this can be arranged by the committee during the coming year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.8 Election of Management Committee/Office Bearers:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The constitution will provide guidance on the election of committee or Board members, including the length of time they should serve. Each individual wishing to stand needs to have a proposer and a seconder.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.9 Voting Procedure:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Check your constitution to find out who is eligible to vote at the AGM. If the constitution does not provide clear guidance on what to do in the event of a tie, then it is usual practice for the Chair of the organization to have a casting vote. The existing committee needs to be clear about voting procedures as lay out by the constitution before attending the AGM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.0 Motions to be put to the AGM:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A Motion to be put to an AGM should usually be received by the organization an agreed time before the AGM, so that it might be included with the papers sent out to those attending. Some organizations do not allow motions to be put at the AGM on the spur of the moment. Motions may take a number of forms. There may be a motion to petition the Scottish Parliament, or the local authority; in support of the actions of another organization; to change the direction or the organization or increase/limit the extent of its work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. IMPORTANCE OF GENERAL MEETING IN THE CONDUCT OF COMPANY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">3.1 Importance of annual general meeting:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is only the AGM of the company that the shareholders may exercise any control over the affairs of the company. They may confront their directors, their elected representatives at least once a year. They also get an opportunity to discuss the affairs and review of the working of the company. They may also take necessary steps for the protection of their interest. They may for instance refuse to re-elect a director whose action and policy they disapprove. They may also take up any other business relating to the affairs of the company for discussion. Annual accounts are also presented for consideration of the shareholders and dividends are declared at the AGM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3.2 Extraordinary general meeting:<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A statutory meeting and an AGM of a company are called ordinary meeting. Any meeting other than these meeting is called an extraordinary meeting. It is called for transacting some urgent or special business, which cannot be postponed till the next AGM. It may be convened by (1) the board of directors on its own or on the requisition of the member; or (2) the requisitionists themselves on the failure of the board of directors to call for the meeting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3.3 Extraordinary general meeting convened by the board of directors:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The board of directors may call an extraordinary meeting on it’s own. The board of directors may call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) whenever some special business is to be transacted, which in the opinion of the board of director, which may not be postponed till the next AGM. Some of the examples of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3.4 Extraordinary general meeting convened by the requisitionists:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every shareholder of company has a right to requisition an EGM. He is not bound to disclose the reason for the resolution to be proposed at the meeting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3.5 Power of company law board to order calling of extraordinary general meeting:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If for any reason, it is impracticable to call a meeting of a company, other than an AGM, or to hold or conduct the meeting of the company, the CLB may, either on its own motion, or on the application of any director of the company, or of any member of the company, who would be entitled to vote at the meeting, order a meeting to be called and conducted as the CLB thinks fit, and may also give such other ancillary and consequential directions as it thinks fit expedient. A meeting so called and conducted will be deemed to be a meeting of the company duly called and conducted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.6 Quorum for meeting:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quorum refers to the minimum number of members who must be present at a meeting in order to constitute a valid meeting. A meeting without the minimum quorum is invalid and decisions taken at such a meeting are not binding. The articles of a company may provide for a quorum without which a meeting will be construed to be invalid. Unless the articles of a company provide for larger quorum, 5 members personally present (not by proxy) in the case of a public company and 2 members personally present (not by proxy) in the case of a private company will be the quorum for a general meeting of a company. It has been held by courts that unless the articles otherwise provide, a quorum need to be present only when the meeting commenced, and it was immaterial that there was no quorum at the time when the vote was taken.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.7 Requisites of valid meeting:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The following conditions must be satisfied for a meeting to be called a valid meeting. It must be properly convened. The persons calling the meeting must be authorized to do so proper and adequate notice must have been given to all those entitled to attend the meeting must be legally constituted. There must be a chairperson. The rules of quorum must be maintained and the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 and the articles must be complied with; and the business at the meeting must be validly transacted. The meeting must be conducted in accordance with the regulations governing the meetings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.8 Minutes of proceeding of meeting:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every company must keep minutes containing details of all proceedings at the general meetings. The pages of the minute books must be consecutively numbered and the minutes must be recorded therein within 30 days of the meeting. They have to be written directly on the numbered pages. Pasting or attaching of papers is not allowed. Each page of every such minutes books must be initialed or signed and last page of the record of proceedings of each meeting in such books must be dated and signed by in the case of the meeting of the board of directors or committee thereof, by the chairman of that meeting or that of the succeeding meeting and in the case of a general meeting, by the chairman of the same meeting within the aforesaid 30 days or in the event of the death or inability of that chairman within the period, by a director duly authorized by the board of directors for the purpose. The CLB, however, may not object if minutes are maintained in loose-leaf form provided all other procedural requirements are complied with and all possible safeguards against manipulation or interpolation of the minutes are ensured. The loose leaves must be bound at reasonable intervals. Entering the minutes in a bound minute book by a chemical process, which does not amount to attachment to any book by pasting or otherwise is permissible provided on the mechanical impression of the minutes, the original signatures of the chairman are given on each page. All appointments of officers made at any of the meetings must be included in the minutes of the meeting. In the case of a meeting of the board of directors or its committee, the minutes must also state the names of directors present at the meeting and the names of directors, if any, dissenting from, or not concurring with a resolution passed at the meeting. Where minutes of the proceedings of any meeting have been kept properly, they are, unless the contrary is proved, presumed to be correct, and are valid evidence that the meeting was duly called and held, and all proceedings thereat have actually taken place, and in particular, all appointments of directors or liquidators made at the meeting will be deemed to be valid. The minute books of the proceedings of general meetings must be kept the registered office of the company. Any member has a right to inspect, free of cost during business hours at the registered office of the company, the minutes books containing the proceedings of the general meetings of the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A company is an artificial person in the eye of law but individual natural person takes up its entire works. The directors of the company may easily get the benefit of working for the management of the company. The concept of holding general meeting is to keep a check on the management, which must not work detriment to the interest of the shareholders as well as the members of the company. A general meeting discloses all the important aspects and maintains a clear balance between the directors, shareholders and members of the company. The importance of the meeting cannot be overlooked in case of companies. It regulates the conduct of the company so as to benefit the entire individual involved to form a company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bibliography</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>www.lawyersnjurists.com</li><li>Business Law: Denis Keenan and Sarah Riches</li><li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/kind">www.wikipedia.com/kind</a> of meeting for shareholders</li><li><a href="http://www.google.com/agenda">www.google.com/agenda</a> of AGM/Business Law: Denis Keenan and Sarah Riches.</li><li>www.scribd.com/doc/5774311/IMPORTANCE-OF-GENERAL-MEETING-IN-THE#fullscreen:on</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><hr/><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> www.scribd.com/doc/5774311/IMPORTANCE-OF-GENERAL-MEETING-IN-THE#fullscreen:on</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/kind">www.wikipedia.com/kind</a> of meeting for shareholders</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> www.scribd.com/doc/5774311/IMPORTANCE-OF-GENERAL-MEETING-IN-THE#fullscreen:on</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/agenda">www.google.com/agenda</a> of AGM/Business Law: Denis Keenan and Sarah Riches</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> The Companies Act, 1956, s. 169</p></div></div>
9186	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE CONCEPT OF INTERRELATEDNESS</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Interrelatedness – mutual or reciprocal relation or relatedness; “interrelationships of animal structure and function” interrelation, interrelationship. relation – an abstraction belonging to or characteristic of two entities or parts together.</p><p>The concept of interrelatedness, of global citizenship and a shared planet does not apply to only environmental issues but extends to the inter-linked responsibilities of human development and environmental protection. The interaction between human health and the environment is very complicated and difficult to assess, thus an objective and precautionary principle should be adopted. The most basic indicators of health hazard are air and water pollution, noise pollution, climate change, bad sanitation and loss of biodiversity. Human health is under threat from natural sources, add to that human actions such as environmental pollution, deforestation etc have worsened the situation. India is a party to the UN Conference on Environment and Development held in 1992. The Ministry of Environment and Forests came out with a notification in 1994 requiring almost all development projects to conduct a study for environmental impact assessment and get clearance for it. The level of enforcement for the various laws and directives is very poor, resulting in deterioration of the environment. India being a developing country is faced with both kinds of environmental health risks, traditional hazards of lack of clean water, waste disposal, indoor air pollution and vector borne diseases. The modern hazards include urban air pollution, exposure to industrial chemicals and waste and development lacking environmental safeguards.</p><p>The organic and inorganic components of nature are bound by very intricate relations that are so sensitive that a delicately minute alteration in any of such elements of nature results in a profound threat to the whole natural balance. So the challenge of the environmentalists has always been to adopt a cautious and objective approach to the various environmental problems. The issue of health in the light of environmental pollution is of immense significance because of the huge role that factors of pollution play in the degradation of the public health as well. The harm caused by the pesticides and other toxic substances is alarmingly severe in terms of not only the amount of pollution caused but also in terms of the impact that it has on the health of millions of people world over. In India, this issue is of special significance because of the fact that the demographic pattern in India indicates a major vulnerability of the population to toxic wastes and other harmful pollutants. Another grave concern is in regard to the high amount of exposure that women and children suffer in relation to environmentally hazardous substances.</p><p>The eagerness of the policy makers and environmentalist is well reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 (hereinafter referred to as ‘UDHR’). Article 25(1) the UDHR has declared that ‘everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and his family including food, clothing, housing and mental care, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstance beyond his control’. Another important international charter that has laid down a major policy guideline is the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Right, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as ‘ICESCR’). The ICESCR has, through Article 12(1) made it binding on the states which are parties to the covenant to recognize ‘the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health’. Article 12(2) further lays down that the concerned states need to take certain steps which will help realise the aforementioned goal of the covenant.</p><p>The Constitution of India has laid down a number of guidelines under part IV through the Directive Principles of State Policy (hereinafter referred to as ‘DPSP’) to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to preserve the environment even while working on the social and economic development projects. The most significant of these DPSPs is Article 47 of the Constitution which has in clear terms laid down the duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health. Its significance lies in the fact that this Article has sought to incorporate the guidelines proclaimed by the UDHR and the ICESCR as has been mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. It is interesting to note that the Indian courts have been very vocal in implementing this piece of legislation as can be observed from a number of judicial decisions. This Article makes it a primary duty of the State to improve public health. Accordingly in Ratlam Municipality v. Vardhichand  the Court made it binding on a defaulting municipality to perform this duty irrespective of the financial resources. This duty of the state is necessarily linked to the ‘right to life’ under Article 21 of the Constitution and this was made abundantly clear in Shaibya v. State of U.P.  wherein a hazard to public health was considered to be a potential danger to the said fundamental right.</p><p>In the course of this paper, we shall go deeper into these initiatives while for the present we may note some important legislation that have left a significant impression on the issues affecting public health in particular and environmental health in general. The two areas of air pollution and water pollution have some major acts namely; the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974  and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981  . Apart from these two acts, there are several other rules and regulations that go a long way in addressing the needs of a positive development in public health regime. Some of these are the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986  , the Batteries (Management and Handling) Rules, 2001, the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Amendment Rules, 2000. The Indian legislature has not only carried out the international obligations as far as health and environment is concerned, but have at same time, seen to it that the incorporated directives are properly implemented.</p><p>One of the major outcomes of these unprecedented developments in the industrial sector has been that global life support systems have come under serious threat, thus broadening the role of the public health policies. Even in present times when one looks into the traditions and practices of the indigenous population of India in the rural areas, one will surely come across beliefs and customs that emphasise on the maintenance of a healthy environment for good health of the population, such as the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. Moreover in terms of modern medical sciences, there is an increased awareness regarding the intricate relation of ‘food, nutrition and environmental security’.</p><p><strong>Indian Legal approach</strong></p><p>The approach of the Indian environmental policy towards the delicate issues of health and environment are commendable. The types of pollution that have a very harmful impact on health of individuals are water pollution, air pollution, solid waste pollution and chemical pollution. Sustainable development in India covers a range of schemes in social, clean energy, clean water, sustainable agriculture and human resource segments. The oft quoted definition of ‘Sustainable Development’ from the Brundtland Report at the World Commission on Environment and Development in ‘Our Common Future’ states that “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”  Sustainable development is a very significant concept for balancing the development of the economy and the maintenance of the essential level of purity of the environment. It needs to be seen how far Indian environmental policy has been able to balance the growth of the economy and the simultaneous protection of the health and environment. The UN Environment Program (hereinafter referred to as ‘UNEP’) report titled, ‘Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2010’  , released on July 2010, has ranked India eighth in the world in terms of investment in sustainable energy  . The report further stated that India invested around US$ 2.7 billion in sustainable energy in 2009.</p><p><strong>Water Pollution</strong></p><p>The Indian legal system provides four major sources of law for addressing the challenge of water pollution. Firstly, a comprehensive scheme of administrative regulation through the permit system of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Water Act’), secondly, provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 relating to water quality, thirdly, public nuisance actions against polluters, including municipalities charged with controlling water pollution and lastly the common law right of riparian owners to unpolluted water.  The most important of these is surely the Water Act.</p><p>For the first time, a big attempt was made at prevention and control of water pollution by the Water Act. This Act represented one of India’s first attempts to deal comprehensively with an environmental issue. The Indian parliament adopted minor amendments to the Act in 1978 and revised the Act in 1988 to more closely conform to the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 (hereinafter referred to as ‘EPA’) The Water Act establishes central and state pollution control boards. The Central board may advise the Central Government on water pollution issues, coordinate the activities of state pollution control boards, sponsor investigation and research relating to water pollution, and develop a comprehensive plan for the control and prevention of water pollution.</p><p>The Water Act is more or less comprehensive in its coverage, applying to streams, inland waters, subterranean waters, and sea or tidal waters. The standards for the discharge of effluent or the quality of the receiving waters are not specified in the Act itself. Instead the Act enables the state boards to prescribe these standards. It is noteworthy that the Section 17 (g) of EPA gives the Central Government similar authority to establish water quality and effluent standards throughout India. The Water Act generally prohibits disposal of polluting matter in streams, wells and sewers or on land in excess of the standards established by the state boards under section 24. As such, a person must obtain consent of the state board before establishing any industry, operation or process, any treatment and disposal system or any extension or addition to such a system which might result in the discharge of sewage or trade effluent into a stream, well or sewer or onto land, under section 25. However, most importantly, this act has defined pollution as ‘such contamination of water or such alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of water or such discharge of any sewage or trade effluent or of any other liquid, gaseous or solid substance into water (whether directly or indirectly) as may, or likely to create a nuisance or render such water harmful or injurious to public health or safety, or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural or other legitimate uses, or to the life and health of animals or plants or of aquatic organisms.’</p><p><strong>Air Pollution</strong></p><p>In India, a number of enactments are relevant for the control of air pollution. These are, the Boilers’ Act, 1923, the Factories Act, 1948, the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 and Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957. The more important ones are the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Air Act’) and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.</p><p>The Air Act is a very significant enactment passed by the Parliament under Article 253 of the constitution. This Act deals exclusively with the preservation of air quality and control of air pollution. It envisages the creation of Air Pollution Control Boards at the Centre as well as in the states with power to issue and invoke licenses to polluting industries, enforce emission standards and to frame rules and regulations for the control of air pollution.  Its primarily directed against polluting industries called scheduled industries, such as textile, power plants, iron and steel, cement, engineering, chemical fertilizers, coal industries, mining etc. Another important provision in this Act is that certain heavily polluted regions may be declared as ‘air pollution control areas’ by the State Government after consultation with the State Board. In such areas it is presupposed that any further pollution by the use of any fuel would become a severe health hazard to the people. Similarly, the use of any appliance can be prohibited in the premises situated in such control areas.</p><p>Moreover the State Government in consultation with the State Board has the power to give instructions to the concerned authority in charge of registration of motor vehicles under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1989, for ensuring standards for emission from automobiles and such authority is bound to comply with such instructions. Also, no industrial plant can be operated in an ‘air pollution control area’ by any person without the previous consent of the State Board.</p><p><strong>Pollution from Hazardous Substances</strong></p><p>Indian industry generates, uses, and discards large amount of toxic substances as in any modern industrial society. Even in the agricultural sector, which is the mainstay of Indian economy, increasing numbers of farmers encouraged by government agricultural policies spray highly toxic chemical pesticides to protect their crops. The hazardous substances that have invaded the Indian environment include flammables; explosives; heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and mercury; nuclear and petroleum fuel by products; dangerous micro-organisms; and scores of synthetic chemical compounds like DDT and dioxins.</p><p>Exposure to toxic substances may cause acute or chronic health effects. Apart from the EPA, 1986 India has an extensive regime for regulating toxic substances. However the EPA is the most important one and in section 2 (e), the Act has defined ‘hazardous substance’ to mean ‘any substance or preparation which by reason of its chemical or physio-chemical properties or handling, is liable to cause harm to human beings, other living creatures, plants, micro organisms, property or the environment’. Under the enabling provisions of the EPA, the Central Government in July, 1989 issued the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules. The first comprehensive rules to deal with one segment of the toxic problem, these rules applied to designated categories of waste that are enumerated in the Schedules to the Rules. Radioactive wastes and wastes discharged from ships as well as waste water and exhaust gases regulated under the Water Act and Air Act are explicitly excluded from the Hazardous Wastes Rules.</p><p>In this chapter we have seen how the Indian legal framework has attempted to deal with the multifarious challenges posed by environmental pollution to human well being. Though this was brief overview, yet it has given us adequate sampling to go ahead with an examination of the Indian environmental policy in terms of the ‘health and environmental pollution’.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Environmental health is responsible for the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person and the related factors that impact behaviour. This is a branch of public health. The essential needs of vast numbers of people in developing countries for food, clothing, shelter, jobs are not being met, and beyond their basic needs these people have legitimate aspirations for an improved quality of life. A world in which poverty and inequity are endemic will always be prone to ecological and other crises. Sustainable development requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to satisfy their aspirations for a better life. Living standards that go beyond the basic minimum are sustainable only if consumption standards everywhere have regard for long-term sustainability. Thus sustainable growth is an important element to ensure sustained purity of environment and a healthy population.</p><p>The compliance with the directions of the Supreme Court has often remained lukewarm. Thus the need of the hour is a sincere effort on the part of the concerned authorities and other stakeholders to come forward with strict enforcement of pollution control measures. Moreover a comprehensive code will be welcome to deal with all the aspects of hazardous substances and wastes and determination of liability arising out of accidents. This should be coupled with a separate set of tribunals to adjudicate dispute relating to hazardous substances, process and wastes.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><b>Meaning of Legal Aid</b></p><p>The concept “legal aid” denotes a wide meaning and includes counseling, payment of lawyer’s fees and other incidental cost for expenses of the litigation.[1] The general meaning of the term “Legal Aid” is a legal support, social security, social arrangement extending and providing special assistance or help to the poorer and weaker numbers to enable them enforce their legal rights through legal process.[2]</p><p>Legal aid means the assistance in the legal matters both inside and outside the courts to the indigent litigants.[3] The New Encyclopedia Britannica defines legal aid as the professional legal assistance given, either free or for a nominal sum, to indigent persons in need of such help.<i> Section 2(a) of the Legal Aid Act, 2000</i> provides that Legal Aid means providing legal advice, paying lawyers fees and cost of litigation including providing any other assistance to those who suffer financial insolvency, destitution, helpless or are unable to access justice due to various socio-economic conditions.[4]</p><p><b>Importance of Legal Aid</b></p><p>The modern justice system through judicial adjudication is very costly and that cost has been the most difficult factor for the average people to get justice in both developed and developing countries.[5] In a suit-where one party is poor and the other party is opulent, here equality, rule of law, and fair trail, ensured in our constitution and other constitutions and documents of the world can not be maintained because the opulent party is able to appoint an expert advocate who can easily take the fruits of the suit in favour of his clients which the opposite advocate fails to do.</p><p>In the case of Bondhu Mukti Morcha vs. Union of India,[6] the former chief justice of India P.N Bhagwati Observed, where one of the parties to litigation belongs to a poor and deprived section of the community and does not process adequate socials and material resources he is bound to be at a disadvantage as against a strong powerful opponent.[7]</p><p>Therefore as long as poor exist in the society legal aid will be necessary to uphold human rights and equality. Thus the provision of legal aid is essential for the safe walk of democracies on the track of rule of law and the equal protection of laws.[8]</p><p><b> Access to Justice through Legal Aid</b></p><p>The main of providing a legal aid scheme is to make the law and legal services accessible, to all in commitment to the internationally recognized principle of equality of justice. Unless legal aid could be claimed as of right, it cannot be said that equality before law has been achieved.[9]<b></b></p><p>In a democratic country, it is a prerequisite that all citizens get economic and all justice. In developing countries, the law is often discriminatory while the process to access justice is slow, cumbersome and complex. The result is that people especially the poor have inadequate and unequal access to justice through requires that both these systems be made to work justly and equitably and this is possibly by way of giving legal aid to the indigent litigants only.</p><p>The objective around which the program of the legal aid woven by the developing countries is that there should be uniformity of law for the poor and the privileged sections of a democratic country.[10]</p><p><b> Cases where Legal Aid may be given</b></p><p>Providing legal aid to some people benefits even those who do not get legal aid by changing community standards; but in orders for this to happen, legal aid must be to a significant number of people. Legal aid is thus an important issue in the development of the society. The emphases on the group who are the beneficiaries are disadvantages in society. Legal Aid may provide representation in the types of cases:</p><p><b><i>Public benefit</i></b></p><p>This includes Welfare, food stamps, medical assistance, supplemental security income, social security and unemployment compensation.</p><p><b><i>Housing Problem</i></b></p><p>This includes eviction, lockouts, confiscation of personal foreclosures, discrimination (racial and against families with children), disputes with landlords over repairs, rent contracts deposits or difficulties with public housing.</p><p><b><i>Consumer Cases</i></b></p><p>This includes debt problems, contracts, warranties repossessions, wage garnishments, discrimination and counseling on small claims court and bankruptcy procedures.</p><p><b><i>Family Law Issues</i></b></p><p>This includes divorce, adoption, custody, support, visitation, guardianship, restraining orders, defense in paternity and modification of decrees.</p><p><b><i>Senior Law Problem</i></b></p><p>This includes Medical, Medicare, Guardianship defense, and Issue involving nursing homes or other types of care facilities.</p><p><b><i>Juveniles Legal Problems</i></b></p><p>This includes expulsion and suspension from school and other disputes involving school. In addition, some office may represent juveniles in criminal proceedings; however, this is by court appointment only.</p><p><b><i>Immigration</i></b></p><p>Some program handle a limited number of cases the area of immigration law.[11]</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><div><p>[1]  Abdul Halim &amp; N.E.Siddiki, <i>The Legal System of Bangladesh</i>, 1<sup>st</sup> ed.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;">View With Charts And Images</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc331378949"></a><a name="_Toc331378875"></a><strong>The concept of Sovereignty preserves the independence of a State and protects against external aggression-explain</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">INTRODUCTION</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sovereign power means basically the supreme power of a state. For any kind of crime the decision of the supreme authority is the final decision. A state within it there is no law. The law defined with specific rules and regulation in the state. Law represent justice to the crime, law is equal for everyone. If the state follows sovereign power the citizens may not get the equal judgment for any crime. There might be a revolution against sovereign power. People who has the internal affairs with supreme authority may treat different then others. For some people justice might not be the same for similar crime or deeds. So apart from the existence of a state and of a sovereign power within it, there can be no law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SOVEREIGNTY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sovereignty in government is that public authority which directs or orders what is to be done by each member associated in relation to the end of the association. It is the supreme power by which any citizen is governed and is the person or body of persons in the state to whom there is politically no superior. The necessary existence of the state and that right and power which necessarily follow is “sovereignty.” By “sovereignty” in its largest sense is meant supreme, absolute, uncontrollable power, the absolute right to govern.&lt;href=”#_ftn1″ name=”_ftnref1″ title=””&gt;[1] The word which by itself comes nearest to being the definition of “sovereignty” is will or volition as applied to political affairs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SOVEREIGN STATE: One which governs itself independent of any foreign power.&lt;href=”#_ftn2″ name=”_ftnref2″ title=””&gt;[2]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Distractedly, sovereignty lives in the body of the nation and belongs to the people. But these powers are generally exercised by group of representatives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. When examined, sovereignty is naturally divided into three great powers; namely, the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary; the first is the power to make new laws, and to correct and repeal the old; the second is the power to execute the laws both at home and abroad; and the last is the power to apply the laws to particular facts; to judge the disputes which arise among the citizens, and to punish crimes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF SOVEREIGNTY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sovereignty, the notion that the state has the authority to exercise power within national borders free of external interference, celebrates its 345th birthday in 1993. The practice began with the Peace of Westphalia, drawn up in 1648 to end the Thirty Years’ War in Europe.&lt;href=”#_ftn3″ name=”_ftnref3″ title=””&gt;[3] The treaty, which involved the Pope and political leaders of Western Europe, utilized the Pope’s prestige to grant leaders of proto-nation states the authority to exercise power within their national borders. The assistance of the Pope was vital to the success of the treaty; with the fall of the Roman Empire, political leaders in Europe experienced extreme difficulty exercising power over interlopers and often their own populations. Political leaders appealed to these groups to recognize that rulers should rule free of external interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although sovereignty has existed for 345 years, uncertainty prevails as to whether it is a new or an old concept. Some scholars suggest that the concept is much older, arguably originating in Roman times.&lt;href=”#_ftn4″ name=”_ftnref4″ title=””&gt;[4]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Whether the concept of sovereignty is old or new, though, it has remained a flexible, yielding doctrine, not bound by its written word. The concept of sovereignty has not been with humankind since societies were created: sovereignty is a relatively new concept for human beings, one that is evolving through negotiations over the centuries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sovereignty can be applied in the twentieth century in organizing individuals and groups against threats. In the East and the West, threats were defined ideologically. Depending on one’s perspective, threats were divided between the capitalists and the communists. In both cases, the authority of sovereignty was enforced to deter the threatening barbarian. With the Cold War over, threats to people are not defined in the ideological terms which formerly characterized the contest between communism and capitalism. The question which now emerges is whether threats can be identified on the basis of pragmatic, grounded criteria. Threats to people, such as social disorder, famine, plagues, natural disasters, and cross-border environmental degradation, were acted upon previously as premises for ignoring the supreme power of that state exercised within its borders free from external interference.&lt;href=”#_ftn5″ name=”_ftnref5″ title=””&gt;[5]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Erosion of democracy may in some circles justify further questioning of sovereignty. The degree to which ultimate political power is vested in the people of a particular nation may be of varying importance to different peoples, states, or non-state actors. Some historical arguments and precedent have suggested that democracy is divisible, meaning that the interest in its preservation and dissemination advocated in advanced democracies is not yet connected with its emergence in the nations of the Global South, such as Kenya, Serbia, or Azerbaijan.&lt;href=”#_ftn6″ name=”_ftnref6″ title=””&gt;[6] The question of whether democracy is divisible in the modem world requires careful examination. While one can marshall normative arguments for both sides of this question, functional analysis suggests that, in the face of pragmatically-defined post-Cold War threats, people need to be not only open to change but able to communicate easily with others. In the contemporary world these “others” cannot be limited to neighbors: others must include “foreigners” from other locations on the planet.&lt;href=”#_ftn7″ name=”_ftnref7″ title=””&gt;[7]</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In China the condition of existing of reckless detention and a transition towards a rule of law is either seen as an expression composed of combined contrast, or as an aberration. This book analyses under-researched institutions and practices in China’s criminal justice system, arguing that detraction from the rule of law constitute an organic component of the legal order. Hidden behind the law, there lies sovereign power, a power premised on the choice to handle certain issues through procedures that derogate from rights. This theoretically sophisticated study overcomes the current deadlock in analyses of China’s criminal justice. The result is an highly innovative reading of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2000 the Council on Foreign Relations established the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geo-economics Studies to examine issues at the intersection of global politics and economics. Few issues fit that description more closely than the subject of this Council Special Report. America’s current account deficit is financed by foreign purchases of such assets as Treasury securities and stakes in U.S. firms. A good deal of these purchases today is made by the central banks and sovereign wealth funds of countries that do not share many American political values and foreign policy goals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some argue that this is no cause for concern. But Brad W. Setser makes a compelling case that the U.S. deficit matters for economic and strategic reasons alike. The United States may have more to lose than its creditors if they sell American assets or stop accumulating them at their current pace. This gives creditors potential leverage over U.S. policy. Setser also argues that indebtedness limits America’s ability to influence other countries’ policies, for example through sanctions and lending arrangements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The problems associated with U.S. indebtedness cannot be addressed overnight. But the report proposes ways for the United States to guard against the effects of a disruption in foreign financing, such as consulting with allies who hold dollars and encouraging other creditor countries to spend and invest surpluses instead of accumulating reserves. It also suggests measures to reduce the need for financing in the first place, such as working to balance the U.S. budget and, most importantly, taking steps to reduce U.S. oil imports.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Sovereign Wealth and Sovereign Power</i> raises the potential strategic implications of U.S. indebtedness, challenging the sanguine view that global economic interdependence guarantees prudence. The report is a significant contribution to the debate on America’s political and economic position in an age of globalization.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BEYOND THE SOVEREIGN STATE</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since at least 1964&lt;href=”#_ftn8″ name=”_ftnref8″ title=””&gt;[8], it has been the doctrine of the European Court of Justice that the Communities, now ‘Community’, constitute a new legal order, neither a subordinate part of the laws of the member states, nor simply a sub-system of International Law. From the point of view of a soundly pluralistic theory of law as institutional and systemic normative order, there is no difficulty about accepting this self characterization of Community Law as a distinct legal order. It owes its origin, certainly, to treaties binding under general international law; and, from the point of view of member-state legal systems, the ground of validity of provisions of Community Law in the processes of domestic law-application lies in acts of ratification or adoption by appropriate modes of decision-making determined by the state constitution in question. But the institutionalization of legal order under the foundation treaties, in particular the establishment of organs for law-making, for executive action, and for judicial law-application, and the efficacious operation of these organs over a considerable period of time, are properly recognized as bringing a distinct legal order into being.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In one highly important sense, sovereignty has not been lost in this process. In international law, no state outside the Union has any greater power over member states individually or jointly than before. Thus there is a kind of compendious legal external sovereignty towards the rest of the world; and politically it seems that the scale of the Community enhances the independence of action of its members collectively and perhaps even individually for some purposes. To the extent that the terminology of ‘divided sovereignty’ is found valuable rhetorically or even analytically, it can be applied here – the sovereignty of the Community’s member states has not been lost, but subjected to a process of division and combination internally, and hence in a way enhanced externally. But the process of division and combination has taken us beyond the sovereign state indeed, well beyond it. Despite the rhetoric of politicians, it cannot be credibly argued that any member state&lt;href=”#_ftn9″ name=”_ftnref9″ title=””&gt;[9] of the European Union remains politically or legally a sovereign state in the strict or traditional sense of these terms. Yet it is to their traditional sense that the political rhetoricians make implicit appeal when they harangue party conferences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this modem world, where the perception is that of many different actors at many tables bargaining among themselves, state sovereignty is limited to promote dynamic interdependence.&lt;href=”#_ftn10″ name=”_ftnref10″ title=””&gt;[10] To facilitate this interdependence, nations will be able to adjust to change and interrelate with greater ease if they respect the same rules both internationally and domestically. The domestic rules for the purpose of this discussion are those of democracy, adapted to local history and culture. As more nations adhere to democratic practices globally, they will find it increasingly easier to justify intervention in support of democracy for others in terms of national interest. The question in the future will not be whether nations will ignore sovereignty and intervene in the affairs of others in support of democracy; rather, current and future questions of concern will instead examine the different circumstances under which such intervention will take place, and how long intervention can be sustained. The questions surrounding 1993 international interventions with respect to Guatemala, Haiti, Peru, Somalia, and Bosnia&lt;href=”#_ftn11″ name=”_ftnref11″ title=””&gt;[11] reflect the 345 year-long continuing social construction of the concept of “sovereignty.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>References</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">newmexicorepublic.org/Documents/NM%20Republic%20Package.pdf</p><p style="text-align: justify;">humanrights.uchicago.edu/Baro/JamesTierney2009.pdf</p><p style="text-align: justify;">www.bartleby.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">http://www.hawaii-nation.org/sovereignty.html</p><p style="text-align: justify;">legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Sovereign+power</p><p style="text-align: justify;">faculty.washington.edu/aosanloo/510/can.2006.21.4.pdf</p><p style="text-align: justify;">digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><hr/><p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;href=”#_ftnref1″ name=”_ftn1″ title=””&gt;[1]<b>Black’s law dictionary (6<sup>th</sup> edition)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;href=”#_ftnref2″ name=”_ftn2″ title=””&gt;[2]<b>Bouvier’s law dictionary (1856 edition)</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;href=”#_ftnref3″ name=”_ftn3″ title=””&gt;[3]<i>See </i><b>THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF </b>INTERNATIONAL <b>RELATONS </b>6-7 (William <b>C. </b>Olson, David <b>S. </b>McLellan, &amp; Fred A.

9191	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE CONCEPT OF TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>The concept of transfer of technology especially to developing countries is fast becoming a global issue which has drawn a lot of attention lately; it’s being discussed in meetings, seminars, workshops all over the globe.</p><p>Technology is important to economic well being transforming productive systems and facilitating economic integration. Due to the important nature of technology all countries seek to improve their technology in the process moving toward industrialisation, boosting their economy which trickles down to development finally.</p><p>Since development is dynamic in nature and open to all countries, its only equitable and fair for all countries to play on a level playing ground on the acquisition of technology thereby benefitting from transfer and diffusion of the very best of technology. However it’s unfortunate to state that this has not been the trend over the years.</p><p>As a result of lack of economic might which metamorphoses into low infrastructure in host developing countries and other negative effects most transnational’s operate from developed countries where they can be guaranteed good infrastructure to promote their research thereby advancing their technology. This leaves an imbalance between the technology possession and technology needed. The end product clearly will be a wide gap between technology developed by firms in foreign countries and that obtainable by developing countries. This leaves developing countries in disadvantaged positions because Trans nationals tend to place stringent and onerous conditions when bargaining for contracts with host developing nations.</p><p>This has raised a lot of complains in recent times which has prompted national governments to improve their technology legislations, on the international level policies and codes(UNCTAD code on transfer of technology) are being structured to regulate transfer of technology contracts.</p><p>The aim of this paper will be to examine the primary clauses guided by the international instrument in a transfer of technology contract protecting the host country which often times is a developing country. On the flip side I will balance the fulcrum by granting protection to foreign investors as well.</p><p>The first part will explain the concept of transfer of technology. The second part which is the crux of the paper will deal with negotiating a technology transfer contract and primary clauses protecting the host country. The third part will be the conclusion which balances the equation by discussing protection for foreign investors.</p><p><strong>PART 1.</strong></p><p><strong>Concept of transfer of technology.</strong></p><p>The subject matter transfer of technology can’t be deliberated upon without having a clear view of the terms ‘‘technology’’ and ‘’transfer of technology.’’</p><p>In other to have a good understanding of the subject matter it’s imperative to consider some basic definitions.</p><p>‘Technology’’ is a broad topic that can be perceived in various ways depending on the perspective it’s being scoped from.</p><p>In the quest of negotiations for an acceptable international code of conduct on transfer of technology the OECD states advanced the following defining technology as ‘Systematic knowledge for the manufacture of a product, for the application of the process or for the rendering of the service, including any integrally associated and marketing techniques’  .</p><p>The term technology tracing it back to it ancient times can be adduced to be derived from the Greek word’ tekhnelogos’,this word is made our from two factors ‘’tekhne’’ and ‘’logo’’s.these two words encompasses knowledge relating to machinery, communication and skills.</p><p>In my opinion technology should be defined in a whole comprising of intangible aspects like managerial skills and patents…not covering just the technical part of it relating it to tangible parts like machines, products, goods.etc.The end product in a technology transfer contract which for instance in a turnkey contract which entails impacting skills to the local content which is a fundamental term in technology transfer contracts is as essential as the manufacturing of the item.</p><p>Basically technology in the view of Santikarn technology:</p><p>‘‘Involves not just the methodologies and knowledge useful in production of goods and services, cognisance should be given to managerial expertise and professional know how.’’</p><p>Analysing the term transfer of technology it’s important to state that it’s no secret that the there is a moral burden or the onus lies on developed countries to transfer technology to developing countries. Like I stated earlier in my introduction developed countries are economically viable to carry out research which is the catalyst for technology.</p><p><strong>What is transfer of technology?</strong></p><p>The term transfer of technology is a relative in the sense that it bothers on a whole lot issues, thus there is no single definition for it.</p><p>According to Muchlinski, he defined transfer of technology ‘as the method or ways commercial technology is being distributed’  .In this context there will be a form of transfer of knowledge by the transferor to the transferee via communication. The contract being literally binding at this state is not a prerequisite.</p><p>Looking at Muchlinski’s definition transfer in this context takes the pattern of a business transaction which might not necessarily be legally binding the highpoint of the definition is that the technology is basically owned and can be transferred by the owner to the transferee.</p><p>Brooks defines technology transfer as ‘the process which science and technology are diffused through human activity’  . Analysing this definition it simply covers a situation whereby an invention or knowledge is developed by transferee and it’s distributed to the recipient who emulates that information gotten from the transferor.</p><p>Transfer in this context could be a transfer of basic scientific knowledge into technology or upgrading of an existing one to a new use. However for it to be transferred it should be packaged in an organised form or some kind of operation.</p><p>More precisely a simple approach can be adopted in analysing the concept of technology going by the definitions and comments highlighted above. In the first instance it captures a situation that transfer of technology comes in an organised methodological form, in simple terms it should contain certain underlying principles in regulating transfer of technology. Secondly there must be two parties in a transfer of technology contract, often known as the transferor (foreign investor) and the transferee (Host country).</p><p>Further analysis of the concept identifies the fact that there are always rewards, gain or embellishment by parties. often times its alleged the host countries benefit more, in my opinion that only on paper because in actual practice restrictive business clauses are inserted in technology transfer contracts which put a lot of restraints on the acquiring party thus becoming detrimental to host countries, most times developing countries.</p><p><strong>Methods of transfer of technology.</strong></p><p>Transfer of technology I n most cases materialises through licensing of patent and other rights tied down with contracts for the knowhow.</p><p>Relying on the UNCTAD transfer of technology code transfer of technology can be transferred</p><p>Through the following means:</p><p>A: assigning or granting of industrial rights.</p><p>B:Handing over technical or non technical or other know-how in the form of supply of services</p><p>C: Providing a combination of technical or non –technical knowhow in the form of documents, plans and diagrams.</p><p>D:providing a combination of services with a view to commissioning an industrial complex</p><p>E: Providing technical service related to the selling or leasing of machinery.</p><p>Considering this context from an academic background ,Chartterjee opined that technology may be transferred in two patterns:</p><p>First, knowledge and skills known to certain equipments are not driven by a monopolistic market where choices are limited. In such instances transfer could materialise through: Migration of professionals from country to country, technical training and instructions, published works will be distributed,colloboration programmes where knowledge are shared.</p><p>Secondly instances where there is direct ownership of machinery it’s normally covered by industrial patent right and agreements are sealed in this context by negotiation. Transferring this instance comes in the form of: Foreign direct investments, granting of licences, patents right, trademarks right, application of expertise etc.</p><p>This second segment will discuss negotiating transfer of technology contract and examine the primary clauses protecting a host country.</p><p><strong>PART 2.</strong></p><p><strong>NEGOTIATING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CONTRACTS.</strong></p><p>Parties are the determinant factors regarding the nature and scope of the contract they intend entering into. Basically parties identify their needs and the terms are sorted out in the negotiation stage. For agreements involving states the sectors for intervention are outlined to the supplier, issues relating to patents right, trademarks ,local legislations on importation of technology, foreign exchange etc must be considered.</p><p>This information exchange stage should be in writing depicting clear terms of the agreement ,this permits parties take a cursory look of the conditions put forward by the other party. All information clear enough concerning the agreement would be displayed at this point giving parties the room to carry out research or acquire more information where there are grey areas.</p><p><strong>Primary Clauses Protecting Host Countries.</strong></p><p>Owing to the exploitation of developing by trans-national corporations over the years developing host countries have improved legislations ,became more aware of their rights supported by the provision on the UNCTAD code of conduct. Most of the primary clauses needed in an agreement will be discussed below.</p><p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p><p>The importance of preamble in any agreement can’t be over emphasized. It’s simply gives an introduction underlining the purposes and intents of the agreement. This important of the agreement summarises the terms of the agreement and highlights critical aspects of the agreement. In a transfer of technology agreement the preamble amongst other things should state that the transferor has invented certain technology, possess skills or knowledge which is capable of being transferred . It also establishes the fact that the recipient is keen on acquiring the licence and the supplier is prepared to transfer the technology. Circumstances where industrial property rights are granted would be stated in the preamble.</p><p>Technology transfer agreements mostly apply to international bodies its pertinent to certify that all parties to the agreement have a concise ,précised knowledge of all terminologies regarding the agreement. Often times there are to lots of technical terms which might have relative meanings based on the perspective it’s being viewed from. Definitions are vital in this sort of contract. It’s not a hidden fact that some words have more than one meaning, thus the exact interpretation of that word based on the particular context should be precisely stated.</p><p>Some words which should be should be given apt interpretation and definition in such a contract is: technology ,know how ,patent, trademarks etc.</p><p>The preamble gives a general scope of the contract, spelling out obligations of both parties. In a technology transfer contract the clause states the rights given to the recipient regarding using it for commercial purposes. Such rights mostly come in two forms exclusive and non exclusive.</p><p>A significant importance of preamble is its conciseness and clarity availing parties the trouble of litigation. Technology transfer contracts are complex contracts due to the expertise and technicality involved. I these technical terms are f terms are not spelt out aptly it could amount to litigation. These sort of contracts are transacted in different international languages which might bring some misconceptions as well…the aim of the preamble is to make all grey areas clear avoiding lawsuits.</p><p><strong>Arbitration or Dispute settlement clause.</strong></p><p>As stated in the preamble a technology transfer agreement is advised to be open, clear, and unambiguous when being drafted. International contracts like theses are complex in nature, there are varying opinions and views which makes it susceptible to legal disputes. It’s trite to state that even well drafted agreements where its clarity is brilliant covering all necessary aspects doesn’t stand free from disputes.</p><p>The likelihood for an impasse or deadlock in a contract like these is natural so a key task for parties is to fairly foresee those aspects of conflict to the best of their abilities and develop into the agreement an agreeable dispute resolution apparatus simply to avoid premature termination of the agreement and unnecessary lawsuits which apparently are expensive.</p><p>Relying on chapter 9 of the UNCTAD code on transfer of technology code which relates to substantive requirement by the acquiring or supplying country. This law is applied based on the jurisdiction where the act took place irrespective of the agreement by parties. Issues such as condition of goods supplied and credit will fall into this category.</p><p>Legal issues have been raised from this chapter regarding the applicable law for parties particularly where one of the parties is a sovereign state most time s the recipient party ..Host(developing)countries posits that most time they are often coerced by supplying parties to make arbitration in agreement with a legal system which is different from the recipient as the mechanism for settlement of disputes.</p><p>The protest by developing countries is that such arbitration clauses compelled by pressure which takes away jurisdiction from national local courts denationalise the issue therefore it’s an abrogation on the sovereign right of the recipient country. These facts are visible in the Aramco and sapphire cases where agreements between oil multinationals and states where governed by international laws instead of national law abrogating the rights of the state.</p><p>Host Developing countries shy away from realm of international arbitration because they feel it’s less favourable to them making them depend on their national law as means of dispute settlement when securing an agreement. This notion has been criticised by Professor Philippe Fouchard who stated that host developing countries should not hope that international disputes should always go their way.</p><p>Governing law of host country or home country brings about so much debate and enforcement can’t be guaranteed. It’s advisable for parties to rely on general principles of states as the binding law in such an agreement. Generally to avoid lawsuits agreements should have arbitration clause that will be binding to both parties. Such clauses should elicit in clear terms the rules that will govern the agreement.</p><p>Host countries apparently will be more comfortable dealing with neutral bodies rather than acceding to the jurisdiction of one party. Host countries in drafting their agreements should tilt more towards the direction of international tribunal institutions like international chamber of commerce(I.C.C),International centre for settlement of investment disputes(ICSID).Its more beneficial in the sense that sometimes tribunals are chaired by an arbitrator from a host developing country and even sometimes laws of the host developing country is are employed.</p><p>Consequently, an all encompassing arbitration clause which will cover virtually any claim concerning the technology transfer agreement is suggested .An ideal clause is the American Arbitration Association which provides that any claim amounting from the agreement shall be settled relying on the regulations of the American arbitration association and judgement awards shall be binding.</p><p><strong>Environmental clause</strong></p><p>Environmental protection is an important issue that bothers on topics like preservation of air, water, soil; safeguarding natural resources, conserving lives of plant and the eco system at large. Transnational corporations pose a lot of environmental hazards in the course of carrying out their business. However this issue is now on the front burner due to globalization of production of goods and services.</p><p>Thus there is the need for a fair trading system which makes available technology transfer and at the same time offering environmental protection and trade environmental strategy. It’s important for host countries to incorporate environmental protective laws into their technology transfer agreements to aid sustainable development.</p><p>Host countries are advised to have strict environmental legislations and also incorporate them in their agreements. All foreign investors should be compelled to tender an environmental impact statement for approval before the agreement commences. Such reports must be all inclusive disclosing all environmental outcome of the proposed development.</p><p>The clause should also ensure that contracting party executes all responsibility under international environmental treaties and also make foreign investors responsible for any form of environmental hazards caused in line with its activities. Host countries should include a clause that compels foreign investor to have some kind of guarantee or retain a certain level of assets which serves as a bond in case there are environmental damages in the course of their activities .</p><p>Host developing countries often due to being in disadvantaged positions when bargaining in agreements like these often times make a lot of compromises which reduces the standards. It’s suggested that that host countries should always maintain the normal standards even if it doesn’t appeal to foreign investors.</p><p><strong>Turn key clause.</strong></p><p>Going by Chapter 5.2(a) and( i ) of the UNCTAD code on technology transfer ,it makes provision for the use of local personnel and also the training of those personnel’s. Basically this clause facilitates technical assistance and training by the foreign investor to the local content in the host country. This clause mainly is enabled through BOT projects in most cases host countries should negotiate transfer of technology by negotiating employment and training of citizens of the host country. Such clause should contain an arrangement where the foreign investor shall train local personnel’s practically, theoretically and administratively and other areas the host country deems necessary.</p><p>Scholarships should be granted for this training and education which compulsorily must be done in the foreign investor’s home country. It should also be included that foreign investors should make smooth the process of obtaining visas,accomodation,transportation etc .Host governments should assign local personnel’s to expatriates as counterparts to enable them have a spot on idea orientation in all areas of the project.</p><p>In precise terms a turnkey agreement the following are fundamental.</p><p>-Product in hand: it should be clearly stated that the host country must learn how to develop and manage the products.</p><p>-Market in hand: Foreign investors being big players in the sector must introduce buyers to the host country.</p><p>-Buy Back: Getting an export market may prove difficult host countries ensures that foreign investors buy back the products in hard currency probably in a cheaper rate.</p><p><strong>Performance Guarantee clause</strong></p><p>This clause serves as a guarantee regarding technical performance yardsticks which the foreign investor should fulfil. It should state the pattern it’s going to be met and also punitive measures if it’s not met.</p><p>Generally ,the foreign investor signs an undertaking concerning technical performance stating that it will be carried out correctly and on time .The time frame should be included and the fine for not meeting such obligations.</p><p>Under this clause there should be provisions that compel the foreign investor establishing research and development facilities in the host country, enabling host country benefitting directly form that facility.</p><p><strong>Termination of contract clause;</strong></p><p>Termination of a technology agreement may be possible due to several reasons not necessarily as a result of a legal dispute. Some possible reasons which can terminate a contract comprises of the terms of the contract being satisfied, a major misunderstanding that prevents the existence of the contract, change in legislations that deal with key aspects of the agreement.</p><p>Basically, this clause should contain anticipated specific disagreement areas that could lead to termination of the contract.eg bankruptcy, liquidation etc. This clause provides for written notice in a good amount of time by a party who wishes to terminate the agreement. The UNCTAD code specifically states that termination should be done in a timely manner.</p><p><strong>Renegotiation clause.</strong></p><p>Renegotiation can occur if both parties by consensus agree to due to supervening circumstances. The UNCTAD code of technology transfer provides for a renegotiation clause. It should contain the conditions, terms and criteria’s for the renegotiation.This clause offers protection against a unilateral termination of the agreement on certain issues and it should be done in good faith .However issues may arise regarding at what time it will be permissible to renegotiate and how to go about the drafting as well.</p><p><strong>PART 3Conclusions.</strong></p><p>Generally, the main objective of the UNCTAD code on technology transfer is to establish fair and equitable standards between parties in the transfer of technology agreements. This work will balance the fulcrum by stating that in a technology transfer agreement not only the interest of the host country should be looked after but the interest of the foreign investor should be protected as well. The major concern of foreign investor s while entering into an agreement with a state or sate owned entity is that it may use its sovereign power to amend to its benefit the terms of the contract . This danger can be curbed by putting some specific clauses.</p><p><strong>Stabilisation clause:</strong></p><p>This clause aims at solidifying the contractual terms by constraining the state using its sovereign power to alter the agreement. The clause simply states that the agreement takes superiority over any form of legislation enacted if such legislation is to the investor’s detriment. This provision gives absolute protection in the sense that some kind of waiver of sovereign immunity.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality/Intellectual Property Protection Clause.</strong></p><p>Foreign investors will want to secure their technology thus this clause will ensure that the host country does not disclose to anyone not permitted to have it. Host countries agree not to commercialise technology information except to employees or subcontractors. It s normally agreed that the host country shall have the right to use the know how only for manufacturing and sell product later .This clause attracts foreign investors because it protects their patent and trademarks which they invest huge amount of resources in.</p><p><strong>Exchange control Transfer of Payment clause.</strong></p><p>The purport of this clause is to ease the foreign investor on restrictions from host countries regarding convertible currency due to lack of foreign currency .This clause protects foreign investor from compulsory compulsion of returning hard currency gotten abroad from the sale of local products.</p><p>Basically this clause allows foreign investors run foreign accounts freely and precludes them from returning of hard currency when converted to local currency is likely to be devalued.</p></div></div>
9192	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE CONCEPTS OF ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>The coursework question is relates with the concept of Alternative dispute resolution. This coursework question is also linked with relationship between ADR, CPR 1998 and EU Directive regarding the matter of Mediation. The comment of Lord Rodger of Earlsferry is a significant part of this coursework. In my coursework I will chronologically discuss the History of ADR, its relationship with Civil Procedure Rules(thereafter CPR), Its implementation in the Courts, Judges attitude on various cases and its impact on European Court of Human Rights (thereafter ECHR) especially in the Art-6. Present situation in legal area and possible probabilities in the future.</p><p>Alternative dispute resolution (thereafter ADR) is a way of trying to melt civil dispute. The concept of ADR arose mainly from a negative cause such as, dissatisfaction with the delays, costs and inadequacies of litigation process. It is the process of resolving disputes in place of litigation. “The most common classification is to describe ADR as a structured dispute resolution process with third party intervention which does not impose a legally binding outcome on the parties.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[1]</span> It is one kind of facilitated settlement, which is confidential and without prejudice. So the materials of the process need not usually be disclosed to a court <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[2]</span> .</p><p>“The simplest forms of ADR to understand are mediation and conciliation. Some important providers of ADR include arbitration within the ambit of ADR since it is an alternative to litigation in the courts. Others would exclude arbitration on the basis that it is a legal process, the outcome of which is binding. Parties to a dispute have always been able to refer their dispute to arbitration which is a far older and more formal means of dispute resolution than either mediation or conciliation.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[3]</span></p><p>In the 1970s the concept of modern development of ADR established in the United States because of high cost and long delays of litigating business disputes. ADR was playing an increasingly useful part in the commercial area to dissolve some disadvantages of highly expensive and strict adversarial system.</p><p>In late 1990s the civil justice system in England and Wales go through a massive revolution. Especially Lord Woolf creates a significant impact regarding the matter of ADR in his enormous report, Access to Justice. His view implemented in a amazingly short time by the civil procedure rules 1998 and the Access to justice Act 1999. These changes introduce a new dimension in the culture of litigation.</p><p>There are different types of ADR used in commercial disputes such as, Arbitration, Conciliation, Mediation, Ombudsmen etc. Arbitration, Conciliation and Mediation is the most famous procedure from all of them.</p><p>Arbitration has the force of law and generally an arbitrator’s decision called an award which can be enforced in the courts just as a judgment of the court. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[4]</span> Section 1 of Arbitration Act 1996 introduced some specific rules and regulations regarding this process such as impartial tribunal, un-necessary delay and expenses. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[5]</span> Conciliation is quite parallel with the concept of mediation. In that process conciliators offer in return not to try the case but this is rarely taken up. The process is mandatory in Switzerland.</p><p>Mediation is the most famous and accepted method of ADR in England and Wales. It is quick, non-binding, without prejudice and confidential. In that process a mediator acts as a “go-between” to dissolve the dispute and wants to make a settlement. The mediator must be a neutral party. “Mediation is about much more than just assisted without prejudice negotiations but confidentiality and privilege are the very cornerstones of the success of mediation. Parties to mediation need to be sure that what they say in mediation and documents produced for the mediation will not become public knowledge or become evidence in proceedings, whether litigation, arbitration or adjudication.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[6]</span> There are varieties of reason to choosing mediation over other ways of dispute resolution such as;</p><p>A less expensive route to follow for dissolves the dispute.</p><p>It offers a confidential process.</p><p>It offers multiple and flexible possibilities for resolving a dispute</p><p>This process consists of a mutual endeavour.</p><p>It takes place with the aid of a mediator who is a neutral third party.</p><p>If we analyse the whole process of ADR then we will find that the most significant criteria of this process is the term “Confidentiality”. This term significantly increase the parties’ interest regarding the matter of ADR. “Confidentiality is integral to the relationship between the mediator and the parties are one of the four fundamental and universal characteristics of mediation. It is the cornerstone of the relationship of trust and that must exist between the mediator and the parties. It is crucial to the voluntariness of participation of the parties and to the impartiality of the mediator. The parties must not feel that they might be disadvantaged by any disclosure that may be used in legal proceedings or in any other way” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[7]</span> In the coursework Question the statement is relates with the matter of mediation. Now i will discuss about mediation and its relationship with CPR 1998, cases and judgement of the courts and the impact of EU Directive.</p><p>There was no defined overriding objective for civil justice when ADR orders were devised by the commercial court judges. “CPR pt 1 has now identified ADR as one of the courts tools of active case management available to achieve that objective.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[8]</span> Lord Woolf provides significant impact on ADR especially on mediation on his reforms proposal. His aim was given prominent status in the courts new case management powers. Especially in , CPR 1.4</p><p>There are some important rules incorporated in the CPR1998 regarding the matter of Mediation or other form of dispute resolution such as, r-1.1(2), 1.3, 1.4, 3.1(2)(m), 26.4(1), 44 etc</p><p>Rules-1.1(2) provides that mater must be dealing with justly manner if it is practicable. There are some element has to be consider in this part such as, parties must be in equal footing, saving expenses, matters must be dealings proportionately, matter must be deal with expeditiously and fairly. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[9]</span> Rules-1.3 provides that parties are required to help the court to further the overriding objective. It also provides general duty of the parties. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[10]</span> Rules-1.4 provides about courts duty towards the parties where stated that court must further the overriding objective by actively managing cases which includes encouraging the parties to co-operate each other, identify the issues in early stage, helping the parties to settle the whole or part of case. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[11]</span> Rules 3.1(2)(m) stated about general powers of management of the courts where court can take any step to uphold and furthering the overriding objective. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[12]</span> Rules-26.4(1) stated that parties can request for stayed. Court can grant their request if they think appropriate. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[13]</span> Rules-44 provides general rules about the costs of the procedure such as; cost are payable by one party to another, amount of those cost, when to be paid etc. In r-44.3(2)(a)where stated that unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party but court can make different order. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[14]</span></p><p>The significant impact of CPR 1998 regarding the matter of dispute resolution could be found in some cases. In the case of Dyson &amp; Field exors of Lawrence Twohey dee’d vs Leeds City Council, <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[15]</span> Ward LJ stated that matter relates with overriding objective of the CPR and courts duty to manage cases according to rule 1.4 of CPR. He also stated court should encourage the parties. In the case of R vs Plymouth City Council <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[16]</span> , where Lord Woolf has given more emphasize on CPR and he also suggested that mediation should get the priority over the litigation. So we can say that modern CPR rules create a significant impact on the matter of dispute resolution.</p><p>Judges always give emphasize on the matter of ADR in order to save the cost and time. Courts also began to give warnings and issue advice at the conclusion of cases that parties should seriously consider ADR or run the risk of costs penalty. Now i will discuss some relevant cases and judgement which will provide the legal approaches regarding the matter of mediation</p><p>In the case of Dyson &amp; Field vs Leeds city Council <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[17]</span> , Lord Woolf was a member of the CA. The matter was related with mediation where Ward LJ said that court should encourage the parties to use ADR to dissolve their matter and it also should be sooner rather than later. There is another important case which is Cowl vs Plymouth City Council <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[18]</span> , Lord Woolf has given a lead judgement regarding commercial court ADR order. He delivered powerful comment on both parties failure to use an available ADR process and the delay and cost of violently contested of judicial review proceedings. He also stated that if the parties don’t go for the mediation then it would be wastage of public money.</p><p>There are case Hurst vs Leeming <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[19]</span> , where Lightman J. Stated that alternative dispute resolution is at the heart of today’s civil justice system although mediation is not in law mandatory but its a significant and attractive aspect of civil justice system. There is another landmark case Dunnett vs Railtrack <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[20]</span> , case regarding the matter of penalty impose for not taking mediation. Mrs Dennett lost her horse because contractors can’t padlock the gate. She sued for compensation but lost in the county court because her lawyer wrongly framed the case. She appealed in person and she gets the permission to appeal. Schiemann LJ suggested for mediation but the Realtrack rejected this offer despite the fact that CA offered a free mediation scheme. CA expressed regret about this. They considered whether Realtrack had made Pt 36 offers. Mrs Dennett was unsuccessful. Then Railtrack asked for their costs but CA made a separate judgement on this cost issue. CA held that Railtrack couldn’t recover their cost because they had refused to participate in ADR.</p><p>So judgement of Railtrack case gets lots of controversy because the party faced adverse cost consequences, even they win the trial. Despite this case mediation is not mandatory or nor it should be because part of the mediation process is that the parties should want to come voluntarily in the process. If mediation becomes mandatory then there is a great chance to lose it significant aspect.</p><p>In the recent case cost sanction issue raised once again in Halsey v Milton; Steel v Joy (joint Appeal) <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[21]</span> ,in this case the actual fact was if any party ignoring to mediate the dispute which was requested by an inter-party then cost sanctions should be imposed or not. “Dyson L.J held the court cannot require a party to proceed to mediation against his will as this would contravene art.6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court did however; confirm that costs consequences could follow from unreasonable failures to mediate.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[22]</span> But it was not clear whether the court take this point because this point was submitted in the last minute.</p><p>On 21 May 2008, the Directive 2008/52/EC on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters was adopted. Article 1 state the aim of the directive is “to facilitate access to alternative dispute resolution and to promote the amicable settlement of disputes by encouraging the use of mediation and by ensuring a balanced relationship between mediation and judicial proceedings.”Article: 3 of the EU directive provide the definition of mediation as a “structured process whereby two or more parties to a dispute attempt by themselves, on a voluntary basis, to reach an agreement on the settlement on their dispute with the assistance of a mediator.” Article: 5 of the EU directive provide discretionary power to courts to invite the parties to use mediation to settle their dispute. Article: 6 of the EU directive states that a written mediation settlement may be declare enforceable if all the parties agree to the process. Article: 7 of the EU directive provide reasonable support regarding the matter of “guaranteeing the Confidentiality of the mediation process.</p><p>The Directives basically suggested the state parties to make the laws to encourage the parties to do mediation by the court, not by compulsion. The directive states, the directive applies to civil and commercial matters, and is intended to promote mediation, and ensure a “sound relationship between mediation and judicial proceedings.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[23]</span> EU Parliament and council agreed the Directive to encourage the use of mediation because it’s a quicker procedure to a civil litigation and cost effective for cross-border commercial disputes.</p><p>According to the coursework question now this essay will justify the statement which is provided by Lord Rodger of Earlsferry regarding the matter of mediation.</p><p>“Obliging parties to engage in some form of mediation whether as a pre-condition to going to court or as a result of compulsion by the court, seems to be…rather contrary to the spirit of the guarantee in Article 6 of the European convention for the protection human Rights” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[24]</span></p><p>In that above statement he has given more emphasize on present situation of mediation and its application on the Art 6 of ECHR. According to that statement present mediation procedure is quite contrary with the concept of “Right to a fair trial”. ECHR adopted into English Law from 2 October 2000 as a result of the HRA 1998. Art 6 of ECHR is quite interlinking with ADR. Now the main issue is whether the present procedure of mediation is violating the Art 6 of ECHR or not.</p><p>Tthe statement of Lord Rodger of Earlsferry is not quite relevant with the present situation of mediation. There are present some reason behind this. Mediation is not a mandatory procedure in our legal system but it has got a special significant aspect after the Woolf reforms 1998.</p><p>Mediation agreement often specifically state that, “The referral of the dispute to mediation does not affect any rights that may exist under Art 6 of ECHR. If the dispute is not settled by the mediation, the parties’ rights to a fair trial remain unaffected.” It is true that EU court encourages parties to settle disputes extra-judicially because it will save cost, time, delay etc. In the matter of mediation court can intervene in the process to protect the right to trial such as; if there is any undue pressure upon a party into a non-judicial process. In the case of Deweer v Belgium <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[25]</span> , the matter related with the debate about whether mandating mediation is permissible or not. Deweer could avoid such proceedings by paying a friendly settlement. He chooses settlement but reserved his right to challenge the proceedings. Then he initiated a challenge regarding the matter of Art 6 of ECHR. “Deweer held to have waived his right to go to court only by reason of restraint which vitiated his consent to paying the friendly settlement.” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[26]</span></p><p>In process of mediation, no one is restrained to settle. Participation is entirely voluntary; any hidden matter of the parties or procedure can’t later be discussed before a trial or elsewhere because of confidentiality. No one ever enters the process on the basis that they must settle or if they don’t that then can’t seek remedy from public court. Mediation is not like the status as arbitration because it totally depends on the parties will. In McVicar vs UK <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[27]</span> , EU court has held that Art 6 is not infringed by restraint court access to vexatious litigants, bankrupts, mental patients.</p><p>In CPR1998 there is lots of provision which should be maintained by the parties before going to any public trial. Before proceeding parties must fulfil some pre-action protocols and practice direction then party must pay court fees at several stages. Parties also need to fulfil other procedural requirement such as; allocation questionnaires, statement of case, disclosure and evidence. In R vs Lord Chancellor exparte witham <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[28]</span> . The matter regarded breach of Art 6 because of withdrawal of court fees exemption scheme for those on income support. So if anyone doesn’t follow those procedures regarding CPR they will be liable and they may get punishment or imprisonment. So it seems that these CPR requirement doing breaches Art 6 because parties have to maintain some rules and provision against their wish and will. Now if these are not breach of Art 6 then why ordering of mediation would be breach of Art 6. In Golder v UK <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[29]</span> , it was held that ADR approved in CPR Pt1, where stated a mediation is not breach of such requirements. In Deweer <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[30]</span> case also confirmed that this dispute process is not breach of Art 6 rights.</p><p>Its clear from the Halsey <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[31]</span> case that mediation must always be voluntary under English Law. Court or judge to order mediation would be a possible breach of Art 6(1) of European convention. If we analyse all of the cases then two significant points would be come out. They are,</p><p>Forced by a judge into ADR</p><p>Strongly encouraged towards ADR</p><p>First approach is likely to violate Art 6, as Halsey confirms. But the second approach is not clear, is immune from challenge under the convention as jack J said summarising in Halsey, ‘the fear of costs sanctions may be used to remove unmerited settlements’ <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[32]</span> . To distinct between Voluntary and Coerced ADR in this background is hard to draw with certainty. Jack J suggested in Carleton v Strutt &amp; Parker <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[33]</span> ” A litigant who is landed with an unfavourable costs order for failing to agree to ADR goes to mediation at the courts suggestion but is afterwards stigmatised as failing to participate in good faith, could reasonably claim that this outcome operates as obstruct or fetter on the right of access to the court, contrary to Art 6, and that their apparent consent to ADR was no waiver of their fundamental rights now directly enforceable in English Law under the HRA 1998″ <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[34]</span> .</p><p>The evidence supporting the use of mandatory mediation is mixed. Central London County Court saw a enormous increase in mediations following Dunnett case, but the settlement rate also consistency declined during that period <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[35]</span> .</p><p>If judges apply too much pressure, the overriding objectives of the CPR may not be achieved its goal to lower the settlement rates with wasted cost and time but some pressure is needed to ensure that parties should consider mediation as an option but this pressure is less needed than it once was because the legal profession involved in construction litigation now knows the benefits of mediation. Although many countries those have strong conscious about human rights and constitutional rights introduce conciliation or settlement conference chaired by judges in their legal system. This can be called Courts mandate mediation. So by this process they want to put mediation within court process which would be more acceptable regarding the matter of conventional rights.</p><p>In the Halsey case CA held that court cannot proceed a mediation process against the parties will which would be contrary to the Art 6 of ECHR but in the case of Shirayama Shokusan Co. Ltd v Danovo Ltd <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[36]</span> , court issued a mediation order even though one party was unwilling. CPR r. 1.4(2)(e) emphasised to encourage the parties to use alternative dispute resolution. Sir Anthony Clarke <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[37]</span> states that “Court has the power to order compulsory mediation and he also said that Halsey decision was a obiter so there was a chance for the judges to make compulsory mediation order.” He also suggested that courts have a jurisdiction to order mediation process under the CPR. Sir Gavin Lightman also expressed his view on behalf of the mediation process.</p><p>Sir Anthony Colman <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[38]</span> states that there is a close relationship between the court and mediation. He also states that mediation process is not mandatory. Lord Philips <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[39]</span> states that in adversarial litigation there are lots of complications such as; solicitor fees, court fees, defendant is faced with a huge bill for the claimants’ cost and insurance, delay and complex procedure, disproportionate cost etc. According to him ADR is quite reasonable and flexible procedure because it does not have any additional difficulties. He also states that court order to the parties for mediation is not infringe Art 6 of ECHR.</p><p>Lord Philips, Sir Anthony Colman and Sir Gavin Lightman are the supporter of mediation process because litigation process has lots of disadvantages and mediation process has flexible, time saving, cost saving and confidential process which is reasonable for the parties as well as for the society. Although EU directives contain some provision where state that court must encourage the parties to use mediation process to settle their disputes. Some cases like Cowl, Dunnett and Halsey cases where maximum of the judges held that parties should use mediation voluntarily rather than mandatory and court always encourage the parties to take this procedure. Although in some cases there was some controversy but different judges has given their views regarding this matter and maximum of them supported the procedure of existing mediation procedure. So at last it can be said that the present procedure of mediation is not obliging the parties but encourages them to further overriding objective of the court.</p></div></div>

Companies are advised to have a social media strategy in place.</p><p class="ecxMsoNormal"><strong>The employment relationship</strong></p><p class="ecxMsoNormal">That these dangers all too often spill over into the employment arena and affect employment relationships and business reputations is often unavoidable as companies come under fire as a result of how their employees (and even ex-employees) conduct themselves on social media platforms. It is thus essential for companies to take appropriate steps to anticipate and address social media blunders so as to protect their rights and interests, as well as the rights and interests of their employees, clients, suppliers, and customers.</p><p class="ecxMsoNormal"><strong>Social media strategy</strong></p><p class="ecxMsoNormal">It is not enough to implement a social media policy and hope for the best. A comprehensive social media strategy is needed. This strategy should set out how the company plans to use social media for business purposes but needs to go further and set out an action plan on how best to address the maelstrom that may be created by unacceptable online comments or opinions posted by employees, that backlash on the employer.</p><p class="ecxMsoNormal"><strong>A case in point – Mr Chambers</strong></p><p class="ecxMsoNormal">An interesting case from the United Kingdom, which starkly highlights the unforeseen consequences of an innocent social media post, is a case involving Paul Chambers. This case has been coined the “twitter joke” trial and revolved around a tweet sent by Mr Chambers to his girlfriend because he was irritated that the Robin Hood airport in the UK had been closed due to snow. He tweeted “Crap. Robin Hood airport is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I’m blowing the airport sky-high!!”</p><p class="ecxMsoNormal"><strong>Convicted</strong></p><p class="ecxMsoNormal">Unfortunately for Mr Chambers, an official of the airport, who was monitoring twitter for threatening messages, saw this tweet and about four weeks later Mr Chambers was arrested. He was ultimately convicted for sending a menacing tweet under the Communications Act. Mr Chamber’s conviction was ultimately over turned by the High Court and as a result of this case, the Crown Prosecution Services was accused of wasting public funds and there was a massive uproar about Mr Chamber’s prosecution in the circumstances.</p><p class="ecxMsoNormal"><strong>A new phenomenon</strong></p><p class="ecxMsoNormal">As a consequence of this case as well as others, the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales issued guidelines on how posts on social media platforms should be dealt with. Mr Stamer stated that social media “is a new and emerging phenomenon raising difficult issues of principle which have to be confronted, not only by prosecutors, but also by others including the police, the courts and service providers.”</p><p class="ecxMsoNormal"><b>South African law</b></p><p class="ecxMsoNormal">In South Africa,  threats of terrorist activity and bombings are criminal offences,  as are threatening communications and conduct or communications that incite violence. Thus, had Chambers been in South Africa, his tweet may well have resulted in criminal prosecution, although, the fact that the tweet was clearly a joke would, we hope, have prevented this.</p><p class="ecxMsoNormal">The lesson from this is that even posts that are light-hearted and meant as a joke could land your employees in hot water. That this could spill over into the workplace is a real risk and should be taken seriously. Having a social media strategy and plan in place could help you to address these risks and mitigate the possible fallout.</p><div class="post-tags"></div></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consideration creates a legal obligation in a contract. Because the consideration is not a part of contract without it the contract cannot perform. There cannot be an agreement if there is no consideration. Section 25 of the act says the same thing in precise terms and also gives three exceptions when an agreement without consideration is a valid contract<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to section 10, “All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of the parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object and not here by expressly declared to be void”According to section 2(a) of Indian contract act, 1872, defines offer as “when one person Signified to another from doing anything with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to, such act (or) abstinence, he has said to make a proposal”<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Contract Define:</b></p><pre>A contract is an exchange of promises between two or more parties to do or refrain from doing an act which is enforceable in a court of law. It is where an unqualified</pre><pre>Offer meets a qualified acceptance and the parties reach Consensus in Idem. The parties must have the necessary capacity to contract and the contract must not be trifling, indeterminate, impossible or illegal.</pre><p style="text-align: justify;">The Indian Act says that “an agreement enforceable by law is a contract “so it show that there must be an agreement and it must enforceable by law. So it proves that the contract of law deal with the agreement which is enforceable by the law. So the contact is the exchange of the promises between two or more parties<a href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>According to Salmond a contrac<br/></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">n   “an agreement creating and defining obligations between the parties”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> According to Sir William Anson, </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">n  “A contract is-an agreement enforceable at law made between two or more persons, by which rights are acquired by one or more to acts or forbearances on the part of the other or others.“</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Consideration Define</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> </b>In everyday language, a consideration is ‘something for something’. If a person does, or promises to do something he expects (and is promised) something in return—which is the quid pro que or compensation—without which the promise is not valid. This ‘something’ is called consideration. In other words ‘consideration is the price that is paid for buying somebody’s promise’. When one person makes a promise to another he does so to receive or gain something which the other person has or which can be made available by him to the person making the promise. A consideration can be a profit or loss, a benefit or damage, or an obligation, but a contract without consideration is not enforceable by law. If A promises to give a gift worth Rs. 10,000 to B. and expects nothing in return, it is not a contract. If A later changes his mind, B cannot sue him for breach of promise<a href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">  According to Blackstone “Consideration is the recompense given by the party contracting to the other” Pollock defines it “as the price for which the promise of the other is bought, and promise thus given for value is enforceable”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> According to Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act -When at the desire of the promisor ; the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something. Such act or abstinence or promise is called o consideration for the promise<a href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Elements of consideration </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> As per its definition in Section 2(c1) a consideration has the following essential elements<a href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (1) Consideration must be the result of the promisor’s desire:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Any action, or abstinence from action, must be at the desire or request of the promisor. If such action or abstinence thereof, is at the instance of a third party, or is done without the consent or desire of the promisor, then it is not a consideration. In other words, if a person does not need a thing or service which is provided to him, he does not become liable to pay for it if it is provided without his express demand. Hence, a promises desire or instruction is a prerequisite for consideration, if A sells his car which is valued at Rs. 100,000. to B for Rs. 50.000, it does not make the transaction illegal because the contract involves a consideration that has been defined and is at the desire of the promisor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (2) Consideration may move from the promisee or any other person:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is not necessary that the consideration is from the promisee; it may come from any other person In this connection, the law recognizes the Doctrine of Constructive Consideration which stipulates that even if the consideration is not from the promisee, the prortsee must be a party to the consideration. In the case of Chinayya vs. Ramayya, a father left his entire property to his daughter under the condition that she will pay a certain amount of money annually to her uncle (i.e. father’s younger brother). The daughter promised to pay the agreed amount annually, but stopped doing it after a time on the plea that no consideration moved from her uncle to herself. But the plea was rejected by the court. It was held that an indirect consideration had moved from her uncle. The law stipulates that ‘a stranger to consideration can sue but a stranger to a contract cannot’.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>(3) Consideration may be a promise to do or abstain from doing something:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> </b> It can be for a negative or a positive act. In a positive act, the promisee does something at the express wish of the promisor whereas, in a negative act, the promisee abstains from or postpones doing something at the wish of the promisor For example, a makes a contract to sell his house for Rs. 10 lakh to B. In this case, Rs. 10 lakh is a positive consideration for A, on the other hand. if A has given a loan of Rs. 10 lakh to B to be paid back by a certain date, and is thinking of filing a suit because he has not received repayment, and is approached by B with a request not to file the suit and accept Rs. 1 lakh as interest for one year, after which he will repay the loan, it will be a negative act which is a consideration for A for not filing the suit.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (4) Consideration may be past, present or future:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> The Indian Contract Act recognizes past, present and future considerations whereas the English law does not recognize a past consideration. These are briefly discussed in what follows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Past Consideration:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> A consideration by a parry for a present promise was given in the past i.e. before the date of the promise. It is said to be a past consideration. It implies consideration for having done. or having abstained from doing, something in the past. For example A renders a SinVICO to B that the latter wants. After a week, B promises to pay Rs. 1.000 to A for the service. It is a past consideration and A is entitled to the promised amount The English law neither does nor recognize a past consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Present Consideration:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> A consideration to do or abstain from doing something given simultaneously with the promise is a present consideration. A cash sale, for example, is a present consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Future Consideration:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> When the consideration from one party to the other is to pass subsequent to the act of doing or abstaining from doing something, it is called a future consideration, For example. if A promises to sell 100 quintals of rice from the coming cop at Rs. 800 per quintal to B. and B promises to make the payment for the same within a week of its receipt, it is a case of future consideration<a href="#_ftn7" title="">[7]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (5) Consideration must be legal, real and certain:</b> A contract wherein the consideration is illegal, unreal or uncertain is void; the parties to such contract cannot take the recourse of law to enforce their rights. For example if A promises to pay Rs. 10,000 to B to beat up C against whom he has a grudge. it would be an illegal consideration for B to accept because if he does beat up C and A refuses to pay the amount, he cannot take the recourse of law to get it. If X promises to give an amount of money to V. and Y promises to pray for X’s long life, it would be a consideration which is not real for X. Similarly. if A promises to sell his car to B for whatever B wants to pay for it. it would be an uncertain consideration for B, and the contract would be void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (6) Consideration need not be adequate:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> As said earlier, consideration is ‘something in return’. The ‘something in return need not necessarily be equal to ‘something given’. The law provides that a contract should be supported by a consideration. So long there is a consideration. the law is not concerned about its being adequate, as per Section 25, but a contract must have a consideration. An agreement does not become void because of the consideration not being adequate. If A decides to sell his car valued at Rs. 100.000 for Rs. 10.000 to B. it is his ‘free consent’ and the agreement will be deemed to be a contract<a href="#_ftn8" title="">[8]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Agreement without Consideration—Exceptions </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> For contract to be legally valid it must have a consideration and an object, otherwise the contract is a wager or a gamble and is void from the legal viewpoint. Consideration is a term which means ‘something in return’ or quid pro quo if there is no compensation in return for a promise. There is no legal obligation in the contract. For example, A promises to present a watch to B on his birthday. If A does not does that B Cannot sue because there is no consideration for A for his promise made to B. But if A makes an offer to sell his watch to B for</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Fundamental Principle of Consideration</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Rs. 200 and B accept the offer. Rs. 200 is the consideration for A and watch is the consideration for B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> According to Section 2(c) of the Indian Contract Act, if at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or undertakes to do or abstain from doing, something. Then such ‘doing or ‘abstaining from doing becomes the consideration for the promise<a href="#_ftn9" title="">[9]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> A contract is valid only when it is based on a consideration. If there is no legal obligation in a contract which can be enforced by law, mere promise and its acceptance does not constitute a contract. For a lawful obligation between the parties to a contract to exist, consideration becomes an essential element of a contract. If there is no consideration, there is no contract, as Satmond and Winfield have said. “A promise without consideration is a gift, but o promise made for o consideration is a bargain.” It is a legal fact<a href="#_ftn10" title="">[10]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Exceptions to the Rule </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It has been mentioned earlier that a contract is void if there is no consideration for the parties. But Section 25 of the Act follows some exceptions to this vital law of a contract. A contract can be valid even without consideration in the following situations:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> (<b>I) when the promise is made out of natural love and affection:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> According to Section 25, “An agreement mode without consideration is void unless it is expressed in writing, and registered under the low for the time being in force for the registration of documents and is made on account of natural love and affection between parties standing in a near relation to each other.” It follows, therefore, that the following four elements are essential for such agreement:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The agreement must be written.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) The agreement must be registered .under the prevailing law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) The parties to the agreement must be intimately related. And</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> (d) There must be love and affection between the parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> For example: A promises to give Rs. 2.00.000 to his son B because of his love and affection for the later A makes the promise in writing and registers the same. The promise, in this case, is a valid contract because of the very near relationship between the two. An important point to be noted is that Section 25 not only stipulates a close relationship between the parties, it also specifies that such relationship must be of love and affection<a href="#_ftn11" title="">[11]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (2) When the promise is made to compensate for voluntary service:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> </b> According to Section 25(2) a promise to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily done something for the promisor, or has perfotmed an act for which the promisor was legally bound is a valid contract even without consideration. But it is essential in this case that the act must have been voluntary, and done for the promisor who was in existence when the act was done, and mu-St not have been done without expecting any consideration. There can be two instances of such a situation: (a) when there is a promise to partially or completely indemnify a person who has voluntanly done something for the promisor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if A finds B’s purse and gives it to him, and B promises to pay Rs. 100 to A. it is a valid contract because B has voluntarily done something for A even though there was no consideration. (b) When there is a promise to partially or completely indemnify a person who has voluntarily done something for which the promisor was legally bound. For example, if A voluntarily supports as infant son, and B promises to compensate A for the expense Incurred in doing so, it would be a valid contract by law<a href="#_ftn12" title="">[12]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> (<b>3) When the promise is made to pay a time-barred debt:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> According to Section 25(3). a promise by a debtor to pay a time barred debt is enforceable provided it is made in writing and is signed by the debtor or his agent generally or specially authorized on his behalf. For example, A owes Rs. 1.00.000 to B. but the debt is time barred under the Law of Limitation. Even so if A gives a written promise to B to pay Rs. 50,000, it Is deemed a valid contract<a href="#_ftn13" title="">[13]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> (4) When the contract is of agency:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> </b> According to Section 185 of the Indian Contract Act, no consideration is necessary in a contract of agency. A person who works as an agent for another is not legally entitled to a consideration unless there is an agreement to such effect between the concerned parties<a href="#_ftn14" title="">[14]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>(5) When the contract Is for gratuitous, bailment:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> A bailment arises when one person (the bailor) transfers his possession to another person (the bailee) on the condition that the bailee will restore such possession to the bailor after the purpose for which the transfer was made is accomplished. No consideration is necessary when such bailment is gratuitous, like when A lends his furniture to 13 on the occasion of the marriage of the latter’s daughter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> (<b>6) When the promise is for a gift or donation:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Such a promise does not entail a consideration. Therefore, a promisor of a gift or donation is not liable to keep his promise and cannot be enforced to do so. For example A makes a verbal promise to donate Rs. 1,000 towards the construction of a room in a mosque. And later refuses to give the amount. Here. A is not lawfully bound to do it but if the promisee. On the strength of the promise makes a commitment that can result in a loss to the promisee if the promisor does not fulfill his promise, the promisee can lawfully claim such damage<a href="#_ftn15" title="">[15]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Conclusion</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Another important element of a valid contract is lawful consideration or object. Barring a few exceptions, a contract without consideration or object is termed a ‘gamble’ or ‘a game of chance’, and is void. ‘Consideration and ‘object’ represent the same thing from the point of view of the parties to the contract. A contract is an agreement between two parties, and what is an object for one party is the consideration for the other<a href="#_ftn16" title="">[16]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>References</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> Sharma Dr.Ashok (2010-2011) <i>Business Law</i>, (Last ed.), India: V.K.

9198	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The consideration is not a part of contract without it the contract cannot perform-illustrate &amp; explain</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consideration creates a lawful commitment in a contract. Because the consideration is not a part of contract without it the contract cannot perform. There cannot be an agreement if there is no consideration. Section 25 <a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>of the act says the same thing in precise terms and also gives three exceptions when an agreement without consideration is a valid contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Contracts come on different shapes and size. Some involves of large sum of money and other trivial sum. Some are long duration and some are short duration. Doctrines such as consideration, illegality, frustration, and duress cannot be ascribed to the will of the parties, nor can statutes such as the unfair contract terms Act1977<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to section 10, “All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of the parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object and not here by specifically declared to be void” According to section 2(a) of Indian contract act, 1872, defines offer as “when one person signifies to another from doing anything with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to, such act (or) abstinence, he his said to make a proposal”.<a href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The general rule of law is “no consideration, no contract”, i.e., in the absence of consideration there will be no contract. However, the law recognizes the following exceptions to the rule of consideration. The exceptions have been given in Sec. 25 of the Indian Contract Act<a href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>. In these cases, agreements are enforceable even if these have been made without consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Consideration                                                                                   </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Consideration</b> is something of value given by a promissor to a promisee in exchange for something of value given by a promisee to a promissor. Typically, the thing of value is a payment, although it may be an act, or forbearance to act, when one is privileged to do so, such as an adult refraining from smoking<a href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consideration may be defined as a benefit falling due to a promisor or a detriment, Incurred by promises. It is the most essential element of the contract. As a general rule, agreement without consideration is void. The promise for a promise in return is <b>consideration</b><a href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>. Meaning of Consideration has been distinct in many ways. Consideration<b> </b>for a particular promise exists where some right, interest, profit or benefit accrues (or will accrue) to the promisor as a direct result of some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility that has been given, suffered or undertaken by the promisee.<a href="#_ftn7" title="">[7]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consideration consists of a legal detriment and a bargain. A legal detriment is a promise to do something or refrain from doing something that you have the legal right to do, or voluntarily doing or refraining from doing something, in the context of an agreement. A bargain is something the promisor (the party making promise or offer) wants, usually being one of the legal detriments. The legal detriment and bargain principles come together in consideration and create an exchange relationship, where both parties agree to exchange something that the other wishes to have.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The consideration must be executed</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consideration must be executory or executed, but not past. Consideration is executor Consideration can be anything of value (such as an item or service), which each party to a legally-binding contract must agree to exchange if the contract is to be valid. If only one party offers consideration, the agreement is not legally a binding contract. In its traditional form, <b>consideration</b> is <b>expressed</b> as the requirement that in order for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must have given something for it (quid pro quo) something must be given or promised in exchange or return for the promise.<a href="#_ftn8" title="">[8]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Good consideration</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consideration is what induces parties to a contract to enter into an agreement.  Valuable consideration is a type of promised payment upon which a promisee can enforce a claim against an unwilling promisor.  There is a difference between valuable consideration and good consideration.  Good consideration may be the feeling of love and affection towards a relative.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">  For example: A promises to give B a piece of land on the condition that A marries B’s daughter C.  This is not a valuable consideration because the promise of giving land cannot be enforced for lack of valuable consideration.  The consideration here, <i>ie</i>; A marrying C, is only good consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Contracts</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A contract is an exchange of promises between two or more  parties to do or refrain from doing an act which is enforceable in a court of law. It is where an unqualified offer meets a qualified acceptance and the parties reach compromise In Idem. The parties must have the necessary capacity to contract and the contract must not be trifling, indeterminate, impossible or illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Indian Act says that “<b>an agreement enforceable by law is a contract</b> <a href="#_ftn9" title="">[9]</a>“so it show that there must be an agreement and it must enforceable by law. So it proves that the contract of law deal with the agreement which is enforceable by the law. So the contact is the exchange of the promises between two or more parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hence by study both definitions you can understand that <b>contract</b> required benefit for both parties<a href="#_ftn10" title="">[10]</a>, if there is no consideration for one party it means that party is not getting any benefit. If there is no benefit for both party it means why they will make contract. And if benefit is only for one party then that is no contract because it is not full feeling contract first essential of switch of promises, goods, services or something worth full for both parties</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Exceptions to no consideration no contract</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Every agreement to be enforceable at law must be supported by valid <b>consideratio</b>n. An agreement made without consideration is void and is unenforceable except in certain cases<a href="#_ftn11" title="">[11]</a>. Section 25 specifies the cases where an agreement though made without consideration will be valid. These are as follow:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.   Natural love and affection<a href="#_ftn12" title=""><b>[12]</b></a></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">   An agreement though made without consideration will be valid if it is in writing and     registered and is made on account of natural love and affection between parties standing in a near relation to each other.

But the promise must be in writing and be signed by the promisor or his agent authorized in that behalf. The   promise may be to pay the whole or part of the debt. An oral promise to pay a time- barred debt is unenforceable</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4<b>.  Completed gifts</b> <a href="#_ftn15" title="">[15]</a><br/>Explanation 1 to section 25 provides that the rule ‘No consideration, No contract’   shall not affect validity of any gifts actually made between the donor and the don if a person gives certain properties to another according to the provision of the. Transfer of Property Act, he cannot subsequently demand the property back on   the ground that  there was no consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5.  <b>Agency<a href="#_ftn16" title=""><b>[16]</b></a> </b><br/>There is one more exception to the rule.

For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract. All that must be shown is that the seller actually wanted the penny. This is known as the <i>peppercorn rule</i>. Otherwise, the penny would <b>constitute <i>nominal consideration</i></b>, which is insufficient. Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts<a href="#_ftn17" title="">[17]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Transfer of money is typically recognized as an example of s<b> </b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consideration" title="Consideration"><b>Consideration</b></a> is something of value given by a promissor to a promisee in exchange for something of value given by a promisee to a promissor. Typically, the thing of value is a payment, although it may be an act, or forbearance to act, when one is privileged to do so, such as an adult refraining from smoking.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consideration consists of a legal detriment and a bargain. A legal detriment is a promise to do something or refrain from doing something that you have the legal right to do, or voluntarily doing or refraining from doing something, in the context of an agreement. A bargain is something the promisor (the party making promise or offer) wants, usually being one of the legal detriments. The legal detriment and bargain principles come together in consideration and create an exchange relationship, where both parties agree to exchange something that the other wishes to have. The purpose of consideration is to ensure that there is a present bargain, that the promises of the parties are reciprocally induced. The classic theory of consideration required that a promise be of detriment to the promissory or benefit to the promisee. This is no longer the case in the USA; typically, courts will look to a bargained-for exchange, rather than making inquiries into whether an individual was subject to a detriment or not. The emphasis is on the bargaining process, not an inquiry into the relative value of consideration. This principle was articulated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamer_v._Sidway" title="Hamer v. Sidway"><b>Hamer v. Sidway</b></a><a href="#_ftn18" title=""><b><b>[18]</b></b></a><b>.</b> Yet in cases of ambiguity, courts will occasionally turn to the common law benefit/detriment analysis to aid in the determination of the enforceability of a contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Comparative Assessment</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"> The value of any given consideration is usually insignificant. So long as the promise gives the consideration demanded by the promisor, the courts are satisfied. Although the act requested is of little value, and the promise given is relatively of much greater value, the courts seldom give any attention to that fact, except as it may be some evidence of fraud. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that a promise unsupported by any consideration and which exacts no action or promise by the promisee is unenforceable. Some consideration must exist. A promise in the nature of a privilege is unenforceable. The mere fact that the beneficiary of the proposed reward must take certain steps to place him in a position to receive it cannot be substituted for consideration. If, however, the promisee is requested to act in a certain manner, and the action is considered to be the price paid for the promise, the taking of such action as is requested will function as consideration. A gift, once it has been executed, cannot be set aside by the donor because of the lack of <b>consideration</b>.<a href="#_ftn19" title="">[19]</a>Once a gift has been completed, the property involved belongs to the done.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consideration must be given at the time of agreement, but it does not include previous acts<a href="#_ftn20" title="">[20]</a>. For example, in the case of Re McArdle (1951), previous work was not seen as consideration in that particular contract for a future arrangement. However, if there is an agreement between parties that previous work is to be included, then that consideration would be seen as valid, this was apparent in <b>Lampleigh v Braithwaite</b> (1615) an in Re Casey’s Patents (1892).<a href="#_ftn21" title="">[21]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consideration in a contract must not be illegal, in the case of Foster v Driscoll (1929), this is where goods were smuggled into the USA, and therefore the consideration became illegal.<a href="#_ftn22" title="">[22]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consideration should not be a duty which exists currently. For instance, in the case of Collins v Godefroy (1831), a lawyer who attended court as a witness, could not also agree to appear in court. Another case is Stilk v Myrick (1809), this is where sailors had a duty to sail the ship short-handed, therefore, when they promised the captain they would do this, this was not a consideration because it was their duty to do this anyway.”<a href="#_ftn23" title="">[23]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conclusion </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the above discussion we have seen that Consideration is the most important basics of a valid contract. Without Consideration no contract can be formed. Consideration must be absolute and unqualified<a href="#_ftn24" title="">[24]</a>. There should not be any modification of the terms of a Consideration to have a valid Contract as avowed higher than. So we can ensure that without consideration contract is impossible,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, Consideration for a particular promise exists where some right, interest, profit or benefit accrues (or will accrue) to the promisor as a direct result of some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility that has been given, suffered or undertaken by the promisee. The consideration must be executory or executed, but not past. Consideration is executor Consideration can be anything of value (such as an item or service), which each party to a legally-binding contract must agree to exchange if the contract is to be valid. If only one party offers consideration, the agreement is not legally a binding contract. In its traditional form, consideration is expressed as the requirement that in order for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must have given something for it (quid pro quo): something must be given or promised in substitute or return for the promise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A contract is an exchange of promises between two or more parties to do or refrain from doing an act which is enforceable in a court of law. It is where an unqualified offer meets a qualified acceptance and the parties reach Consensus in Idem. The parties must have the necessary capacity to contract and the contract must not be trifling, indeterminate, impossible or illegal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to contract act every promise or every set of promise forming the consideration for each other is an agreement. So, there can’t be an agreement without consideration and there can’t be a contract without agreement. Section “10” of the contract act say’s that all agreement is contract if they are made with the free consent of the parties competent to contract for a lawful consideration and with lawful objects. Therefore (sec:25)<a href="#_ftn25" title="">[25]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hence by watching both definitions you can understand that contract required benefit for both parties. if there is no consideration for one party it means that party is not getting any benefit so, If there is no benefit for both party it means why they will make contract. And if  benefits only for one party then that is no contract because it is not full feeling contract first essential of substitute of promises, goods, services or something worth full for both parties</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>References</b></p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Business  Law , Commercial Law, Got.

These rules are set keeping the people’s culture, tradition and the countries entity in mind. Almost all countries of the world have few common basic characteristics in their <em>Constitution<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/TAWHID%20IMAM%200910244030.doc#_ftn1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></em>. These are to ensure that the basic rights of the people are protected. <em>Constitution</em> also sets the rules for the formation of the government, for constructing political party and for the arrangement of election. All political parties, all organization and institution set their internal rules according to the constitution of the country. The core intention of <em>Constitution</em> is to serve the people or any legal entity by providing them with a guide line.</p><p>These guidelines may seem like barriers but the ultimate result of maintaining the <em>Constitution</em> works in favor of the people.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Constitution and the Position it holds: </span></strong><em>Constitution</em> works as the ultimate law for a country or state .The position of which is beyond the reach of the government or the people to manipulate. <em>Constitution </em>is not under the government but the government is under the<em> Constitution. Constitution</em> assigns authority and power to institutions or legal entities and also draws the limit to those powers. <em>Constitution</em> also refers to the rights that the institutions or legal entities posses.</p><p>According to Scott Gordon, <em>a political organization is constitutional to the extent that it “contain[s] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution" title="Institution">institutionalized</a> mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberties</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenry" title="Citizenry">citizenry</a>, including those that may be in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group" title="Minority group">minority</a>.”<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/TAWHID%20IMAM%200910244030.doc#_ftn2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em><em> a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an </em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peoples Power According To the Constitution:</span> </strong>The goal of <em>Constitution </em>is to set a law structure for the general people in a way that it should protect the right of the people and also work as a reference point for their duties. Constitution<em> </em>is structured in such a way that it can be considered as a guide line.  It works as a judgment mechanism or as a touch stone, so when ever any action has been performed by the people or an institution it can be judged to see whether it is fair from all perspective and from every one’s point of view.<em> a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an   a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an </em></p><p>First of all the base of <em>Constitution </em>includes the country’s and the people’s entity and it is agreed up on by the people. So by nature it reflects the opinion of the people and serves the core benefit of the country.</p><p>Considering an incident in which more than one party is involved, and their actions or opinions are contradictory. To judge who is right you need to follow a law which is accepted by the mass or the authority. In this case if one party is an institution and the other is party is the government then the authority is the <em>Constitution, </em>who will judge whose right and whose not .Now considering the same case but with an exception that there is no <em>Constitution</em>, government being the superior party can easily turn the decision their way and on the other party will become  a victim of the situation .<em> Constitution </em>Is the authority that fills this gap because it contains the extreme or the ultimate power and even the government falls under it . So it is easily observable from this incident that <em>Constitution </em>serves the people of a country and protects their sovereignty from being robbed by any one superior. <em>a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an   a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an   a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an   a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a an a </em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peoples Power According To The Constitution Of Bangladesh :</span> </strong>The constitution of  Bangladesh also emphasizes on the role and rights of the people of Bangladesh .Many of the articles including article7, article27 , article28 , article29 , article31 expresses</p><p>the right and equality given to the people of Bangladesh .</p><p>And it is obvious from the preamble that this constitution is opting for a democratic government in order  to protect the fundamental human rights and leave in harmony beyond any form of discrimination .</p><p><em>As justice ABM Khairul Haque  asserted “Those representatives </em>(referring to the member of parliament who are selected by the people under the constitutional law )<em> are the agents of the people.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>?</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Title:</span></strong><strong> ‘The constitution declares that the sovereignty lies with the people and the constitution is the embodiment and solemn expression of the will of the people’.</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract:</span></strong> This essay focuses on the constitution which is a set of rules that will say how to operate the organization and what are the liabilities of the members of the organization. It is a support or gives a guideline that how to operate a country or an organization. One difference between constitution and law is that if we break the law then there is a punishment but if we do not follow the constitutions then there will not be any punishment. Basically, constitution is a set of rules decided by the citizens. Because the primary power belongs to the citizens as they vote those people and after that the power is exercised by the government. Even the rule of law is all about the equality in terms of relations of government and citizens. Therefore it is a legitimate process as the governments are being selected by the citizens at first. In accordance with it whether constitution is being followed or not totally depends on the individuals or the normal public of the country. But Karl Marx is saying on a contrary that it is to protect the proletariats of the society only means only the rich people can take the advantage of it. Whereas rule of law should be the objective and it should be fairly applied. In addition Joseph Raz mentioned that the rule of law is an ornament of the State. So it says that human rights are included in the constitution where it is with the people will that whether they would follow the constitution or not as the political sovereignty lies with the people.</p><p><strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Table of Content</span></strong></p><p>Introduction                                                                                                 4</p><p>Body</p><p>Constitution of  United kingdom                                                             4</p><p>Constitution of Bangladesh                                                                                                                    5</p><p>Constitution of Unites States                                                                             6</p><p>Legal Bodies or Areas                                                                                       7</p><p>The Executive                                                                                8</p><p>The Legislature                                                                              8</p><p>The Judiciary                                                                                 9</p><p>Rule of Law means Equality                                                                    9</p><p>Defining Sovereignty                                                                               10</p><p>Distinguishing between legal and political sovereignty                                     10</p><p>The validity of law and the effectiveness of law                                             10</p><p>Will of the people in accordance with Human rights                             11</p><p>Suggestions &amp; Own Point of View                                                               12</p><p>Bibliography                                                                                                14</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction:</span></strong></p><p>A constitution is a set of rules, generally written, which identify and regulate the major institutions of the state and govern the relationship between the state and the individual citizen.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> Basically it is a fundamental law that is determining the fundamental political principles of a government. In most countries the written constitution is the ultimate source of legal authority, where all actions of government and the lawmaking body <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn2">[2]</a> must conform to the constitution.</p><p>Whether the constitutions are written one or an unwritten one all the common features would be shared by both of the constitutions. Hence it will identify the principal institutions of the state which has three branches like the executive, the legislative and the judicial. Moreover the constitution will identify the rights and freedoms of citizens through a Bill of Rights which operates both to protect citizens and to restrict the power of state.</p><p>Constitution has many forms such as written and unwritten, republican and monarchical, unitary and federal, rigid and flexible, supreme and subordinate.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Constitution of United Kingdom:</span></strong></p><p>So now let us take a view on a further classification explains whether a particular constitution is supreme or subordinate. A supreme constitution is not subject to any external superior force. A subordinate constitution is one where- as with former British colonies -the constitution is drafted and introduced in a country by an external sovereign power and theoretically it may be amended or go for appeal again with the help of that external power. So in relation to this aspect of constitutions, much debate continues concerning the status of the British constitutions following membership of the European Union. Now the key question here lies that to whom does the sovereignty lie? If we consider from the standpoint of the European Court of Justice of the community , the treaties which have been made or established  totally defines the Community and Union are supreme and sovereignty of the people only would be to them if they have a membership or the country has to be a member state of the European Union. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> Therefore the unwritten British constitution displays the characteristics that it is monarchical, largely unitary and has a supreme Parliament. British customs, statutes<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> and precedents<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> are so strong that the British government considers itself bound by practices developed over the centuries. Thus British does have a constitution in a way.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn6">[6]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Body:</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Constitution of Bangladesh:</span></strong></p><p>Now if we will consider the example of our own country Bangladesh which has a written constitution like the other countries. The Bangladeshi constitution has been amended whenever a new government is replaced which has also been reflected in the state principles. While there was a commitment to Socialism in the original version of the constitution, it was as soon as 1977 under Zia-ur Rahman that it was defined as ‘economic and social justice”. In the same era, even the original principle of Secularism was removed from the preamble and absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah was inserted. In fact, the earlier existence of Islam and Socialism looks odd, considering that most communists and socialists are actually atheists and partially used to believe that there is a fundamental difference incompatibility between religion and socialism.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn7">[7]</a> In Bangladesh, although there have been frequent regime changes-from democracy to one party rule, from parliamentary to presidential and back to parliamentary democracy.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn8">[8]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Constitution of United States:</span></strong></p><p>If we take another example of written constitution which is the oldest one and that is the constitution of America. It is the central instrument of American government and it is also known as the supreme law of the land. Even this US constitution has served as the model for all other various countries of the world. The constitution owes its staying power to its simplicity and flexibility.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn9">[9]</a>Therefore the path to the constitution was not very easy as well as not very straight. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn10">[10]</a> The US Articles of Confederation a d subsequently; the US Constitution symbolized American independence<strong>.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn11"><strong>[11]</strong></a></strong>According to the preamble of the US constitution, the nation is dedicated to six goals.<strong> <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn12"><strong>[12]</strong></a> </strong>In addition self government did not exist earlier in the United States which existed in the England and for this reason they did not had the written constitution.  But the degree to which the constitution committed the United States to rule by the people was unique.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn13">[13]</a> Therefore the ultimate authority was given to the American people who can change the fundamental law by changing or improvising the existing constitution if they ever wish to do so. Mostly, the American people express their will through the ballot box rather doing it directly.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn14">[14]</a><strong> </strong>Now we can take the voting system as an example that though the legal people are selected by the government but again the ultimate authority rests on the public as we have to take the final decision whom to support by giving votes. However, under a written constitution this background has a particular significance.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn15">[15]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legal Bodies or Areas:</span></strong></p><p>Although the constitution has changed in many aspects since it was first adopted, its basic principles remain the same now as in 1789.</p><p>The three main branches of government- executive, legislative and judicial are very different and distinct to each other. As per the rule of law it says that all persons are equal before the law and are equally entitled to its protection. All states are equal and there will not be any biasness or special treating some specific people from the federal government. Within the limits of the constitution, each state must recognize and respect the laws of the others. State governments should also be a democratic one like the federal government where the ultimate authority remains with the people. Now the people have the right to change their form of national government by legal means defined in the constitution itself.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn16">[16]</a><strong> </strong></p><p>The separation of powers together with the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty runs like a thread throughout the constitution of the United Kingdom.  This very concept has played a significant role in the formation of constitutions. In any state there are three very essential government bodies existed in the countries which are executive, legislative and the judiciary. This has been mentioned that none bodies should have extreme power or authority which should balance these institutions in course of their activities.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The executive</span></strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>The executive may be clearly defined as that branch of the state which formulates guiding principle and is dependable for its implementation. But it is said in official terms that the sovereign is the leader of the executive body. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn17">[17]</a><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The legislature:</span></strong></p><p>The queen in Parliament is the sovereign law making body within the United Kingdom. The government is formally expressing that parliament comprises the Queen, House of Lords and House of Commons.

The judiciary is self-governing of both parliament and the executive. It is evident however at the same time as a degree of judicial independence is protected under the constitution.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule of Law means Equality:</span></strong></p><p>The decisions of the judges through the analysis of statutes or through improvement of the common law are a source of constitutional law where they have an effect on the powers of the state, the relationship between institutions of the state and the protection of citizens rights and freedoms.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn22">[22]</a> Even AV Dicey agreed with this.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn23">[23]</a> Though rule of law says equality before the law but Dicey is not saying that in the society everyone is getting the equal rights.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn24">[24]</a> For an example we can consider the case of Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn25">[25]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defining Sovereignty:</span></strong></p><p>Sovereignty is the authority to govern or rule a nation or group of people.<br/>“Sovereignty is the exclusive right to exercise supreme political (e.g. legislative, judicial, and/or executive) authority over a geographic region, group of people, or oneself.”<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn26">[26]</a> In a democracy, sovereignty is considered to reside with the individual citizens. Sovereignty then is limited and conditional where government holds supreme power on trust for the people. This is because people are trusting government that they will take the best decision on what to do if any crime or injustice has taken place against them.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Distinguishing between legal and political sovereignty:</span></strong></p><p>It is often difficult to distinguish clearly between legal and political sovereignty. AV Dicey said that the people grasp political sovereignty where legal authority rests on the “Queen in Parliament”.  Therefore this legal theory contributes to an appreciative of legal and political sovereignty surrounded by the constitutions. So John Austin, Hans Kelsen and HLA Hart has identified that the jurists would surely seek an clarification of the source of ultimate authority, its identifying characteristics and the manner in which sovereignty is upheld within a legal order.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn27">[27]</a> The jurist of nineteenth century John Austin<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn28">[28]</a> offered that to have an in depth analysis of sovereignty. Austin’s theory was an attempt to define law in the positivist tradition.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn29">[29]</a> Laws are basically neither more nor less than the common commands of this sovereign, to which sanctions are attached.  From Austin’s point of view, sovereignty is a legal concept within the United   Kingdom where political concept lies within the Queen of Parliament whereas the ultimate sovereignty rests on the people. Hans Kelsen identified sovereignty both within a state and within the international legal order.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn30">[30]</a> Kelsen’s theory involves nothing less than an attempt to formulate a scientific global analysis of law. For Kelsen positive, man made, law is best expressed as a “norm”.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn31">[31]</a> But unless and until the country is not democratic itself, the sovereignty will not lie with the people rather it would totally rest on the government.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The validity of Law and the Effectiveness of Law:</span></strong></p><p>The importance of the distinction between validity and effectiveness of law lies in explaining the ultimate source of authority or Sovereignty within a state.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn32">[32]</a> The ultimate power that has been rejected by the people within the state would be captivating the power that they had entrusted to the sovereign. So therefore it can be again understood clearly that the legal sovereignty which was supposed to be dependent on the “Queen of Parliament” according to the British Law, is actually highly dependent on the political sovereignty which is the people. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn33">[33]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will of the people in accordance with Human rights:</span></strong></p><p>The Human Rights Act1998<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn34">[34]</a> represents an elementary change in the domestic protection of rights.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn35">[35]</a> Nobody could force anyone to do something against their own will. Though laws are made to protect us and to live peacefully but at the same time on a contrary there are several crimes happening only because of those people’s own will. Therefore in addition even US passed a declaration of independence in 1776.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn36">[36]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suggestions &amp; Own Point of View:</span></strong></p><p>Having a written constitution, a country like ours; it is rather easy to allocate who holds what power, and what are the roles of the government and the citizens, the ministers and the judges. The guidelines are made in such a way that the interest of all is served and at the same time the primacy of what we call the government is maintained, which is ultimately achieved by meeting expectations and demands of the people of the country.</p><p>It can be easily said that sovereignty lays with the government and the politicians in a country where there is no democracy such as Pakistan being under the command of military or when Bangladesh was under the control of the CARETAKER GOVERNMENT.  Bangladesh and most countries in the world have a voting system via which democracy is upheld and so it is the voice of the public that is ultimately given precedence and priority over that of the desires and wishes of the political candidates or parties. With those services that they offer to provide, the people choose the better representative for themselves thus setting their own controlling body. As a cumulative body the people or the electorate are what we can say are the sovereign.</p><p>As per H. L. A. Hart the word sovereignty can be easily explained and used if it is taken to mean that the electorate <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn37">[37]</a> is what is cumulatively known as the sovereign. As they are the ones who are voting and choosing their leaders and if they revolt or refuse to vote there can be a completely different situation, enforcing to present with a new candidate, or perhaps a better candidate for the position. Whether sovereignty lies with the people or with the government is a real controversy and it can be only resolved by looking at the practical situation of the current world. For that we need to consider a number of examples like smoking, voting system, eve teasing, rape. Like if we consider the R v. R case<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn38">[38]</a> then it could be understood about the situation for women was such that they could not ask for a fair trial for rape as the law was not made that way to address such issues, but after a long time and from the many cries for reform the law had to be changed and the beginning of this was initiated via the famous case <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R v. R</span>.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/lawmid1.docx#_ftn39">[39]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bibliography:</span></strong></p><p>Kavanagh , D.

The constitution is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and , like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.

According to a scholar</p><p><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn3"><em><strong>[3]</strong></em></a><em>“A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to comprise a written constitution.”</em></p><ol><li><strong>II. </strong><strong>Sovereignty</strong><strong> </strong></li></ol><p>Sovereignty means the declaration of the independence of a nation. When one country declares its sovereignty it declares its presence to the world. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn4">[4]</a>It is the power to do everything in a state without liability, from making laws to execute and ended up with applying them. Laws are basically made to impose and collect taxes and charge contributions, to make relations with other alliances in order to retain friendly relationship and if something is wrong they can protect their sovereignty by doing war or peaceful meeting.  <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn5">[5]</a>From the ancient time, the pre-condition to be a sovereign country was that the nation must have the ability to ensure the best interests of its own citizens. That means, if any state does not behave according its peoples interest it cannot be consider as a “<strong>sovereign</strong>” state.</p><p>Linking the constitution with the sovereignty</p><p><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn6">[6]</a>Constitution is considered as an assurance that cannot be renegoti­ated. Thus it is considered unambiguously as the “the supreme Law of the Land”—in addition to it, anything is in the constitution or Laws of any nation to the opposing apart.</p><p><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn7">[7]</a>On the other hand sovereignty is considered as a sole characteristic and is a result of the unwritten constitution. It means that when a nation declares its sovereignty it also forms its constitution and according to it its constitution it behaves. Constitution is formed in concerning about to protect the sovereignty. Sovereignty is an achievement for a nation and the constitution is always there to retain it. One country takes action according to its jurisdiction or according to the constituent and that is by law. Both sovereignty and the constitution are linking up in order to run a nation successfully.</p><p>People, Sovereignty and the Constitution</p><p>Constitution is the reflection about the rights of the people of a nation. People are solely responsible for the formation of the constitution and the pre-condition of declaring a sovereign country is to take of the public interest. So in both ways public interest is being taken care of or it is the main concern. Sovereignty focuses on the interest of the country people. On the other hand constitution is there to protect the interest of the public and for the constitution people can express their interest.</p><p>It concerns that if one nation wants to maintain its sovereignty it must have constitution to back for it. Since sovereignty lies on the people and constitution is the expression of the people so in both case people is the factor to form   a country. People can best express their interest and the way of expressing it is the Constitution.</p><p>Almost every sort of organizations follows a constitution. For example universities have constitution to define the power among its different boards, members and committees. But when someone talks about constitutions it is mainly about political constitutions. It basically sets the structure of a government. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn8">[8]</a>Constitution defines how the rules and laws are made and by what procedures. So it clearly says that a constitution is prior to government. A constitution also defines how breaches of those rules are to be dealt with. It defines the legitimacy of the government as well as the power and rules under which the government must act; undoubtedly it also sets the limits.</p><p><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn9">[9]</a> Within the country, a constitution is placed on the basis the values of one nation upon which that country is based, and also the process by whom and how the laws will be made. Some constitutions, especially written constitutions, also act as limiters of state power by establishing lines which a state’s rulers cannot cross such as fundamental rights.</p><p><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn10">[10]</a>The founders of the nation believed that the people should have maximum autonomy and independence, and that the appropriate responsibility of the government is to look after that independence. The US Constitution is a document firmly “enumerating” and restricting the powers of government.  While doing drafting, they were doubtful of a well-built central government, that’s why they were forced to mention specifically that the Constitution does not delegate any kind of power to the United States, nor barred to the states, but kept to the states respectively, or to the people. This was the indication that the drafters just wanted to restrict the powers of the Federal government. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn11">[11]</a>The longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world is in the India Constitution, containing 444 articles, <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn12">[12]</a>12 schedules and 94 amendments, with 117,369 words in its English language version; <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn13">[13]</a>on the other hand the United States Constitution is the shortest written constitution, at 7 articles and 27 amendments.</p><p><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn14">[14]</a>Usually, all the current written constitution consult definite powers to an organization or institutional entity, establishment is based on the initial clause that it abides by the unwritten constitution’s limitations. <a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn15">[15]</a>According to Scott Gordon,</p><p>“<em>A political organization is constitutional to the extent that it “contain[s] institutionalized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and liberties of the citizenry, including those that may be in the minority</em>.”</p><p>Sovereignty in government is that public right which indicates or commands what can be done by each and every associate related in relation to the end of the organization. All the citizens of a nation and the person or body of persons in the state who is not politically superior are governed by this supreme power. Initially, it was believed that sovereignty lies with the Parliament as A. V. Dicey said that in 1880s. However, a number of people disagreed with his theory. They argued sovereignty must lie with the people if people voted for Parliament. Dicey spoke against this by classifying sovereignty into two types – legal and political.</p><p><em>He said that legal sovereignty lay with Parliament as they make the laws while political sovereignty lay with the people on Election Day. However, Norton argued in the 1900’s that ‘If one accepts that sovereignty is indivisible, how can one have two distinct bodies (the electorate and Parliament) each exercising sovereignty?’<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn16"><strong>[16]</strong></a> </em></p><p><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn17">[17]</a>Sovereignty refers to where the supreme authority in a State lies.  For example, the Constitution of the USA places “sovereignty” with “the People” whereas, in the U.K.,<em> essentially as a result of history,</em> it is the Queen in Parliament which is sovereign and where the ultimate law-making authority is said to lie.</p><p>Since Australia is a democratic country, sovereignty lies with the people of Australia. And in a democratic country, by definition, the people rule. Australia is a country where the law made by the common people, well known as Common Law, prevails over all other forms of law.  The Australian Constitution is Common Law because it was directly approved by and can only be altered by a referendum of the common people.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn18">[18]</a></p><p>Bangladesh, its Constitution and the Sovereignty</p><p>In concern about today’s situation, taking Europe in consideration, we can either have The Queen as the constitutional head of a sovereign country, or we can have a president of the European Union. But, by definition – and despite John Major’s claim after Maastricht that The Queen was henceforth a citizen of Europe – we cannot have both.<br/>Taking Bangladesh in consideration former Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed in the landmark verdict on the Constitution Eighth Amendment case found that Bangladesh’s Constitution stands on certain fundamental principles, which are its structural pillars and if those pillars are demolished or damaged, the whole constitutional edifice will break down. He listed the following to be the basic structures of the Constitution, namely — sovereignty belongs to the people, supremacy of the Constitution as the solemn expression of the will of the people, democracy, republican government, unitary state, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary and the fundamental rights.<br/>On the question of basic features, Justice BH Chowdhury in the Eighth Amendment case listed 21 ‘unique features’ of the Constitution and held that ‘some’ (without specifying which) of the said 21 features are the basic features of the Constitution.<br/>Justice ABM Khairul Haque in the Fifth Amendment case held that sovereignty of the people, supremacy of the Constitution, rule of law, democracy, republican form of the government, unitary state, separation of powers, independence of judiciary, fundamental rights and secularism are the basis of the Constitution. Haque also stated that the Constitution is the supreme law in Bangladesh, all functionaries of the republic are the creatures of the Constitution and the existence of the country as a republic is dependent on its Constitution.<br/>An independent person of this world after getting his or her sovereign country declares that he or she will no longer be the slave of those that possibly ruled me by force.

As a matter of fact, there was never any democracy in Pakistan time. When the results of the December 1970 elections were announced, the dictators and their oppressive acquaintances conspired to thwart democracy by not recognizing and giving power to the elected representatives. It is this denial of democratic recognition that finally led to the struggle for a separate homeland for the Bengalis.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn20">[20]</a><br/><a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/nsu%20law.doc#_ftn21">[21]</a>The political system of Bangladesh rests on the dissimilarity among constitutional and other laws.  People I its ultimate sovereignty laid down the former solemn principles, afterwards regulations are made within the limited authority by its representatives, and the courts can hold unauthorized and void any act which exceeds those limits. Also the court can do this job because they are maintaining against the parliament the primary principles which the people themselves have determined to support, and they can do it only on the basis that if the people feel that the constitution is something more sacred and enduring than ordinary laws, something that derives its force from a higher authority.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>No one constitution will be exactly the same as another constitution. This is because in the words of Finer. All constitutions contain elements that are autobiographical and correspondingly idiosyncratic. Different historical contexts have generated different preoccupations; different preoccupations have generated   different emphasis. However, despite acknowledging that constitutions have their own  particular features it is worth nothing finer et al have taken at a ‘general level’ the constitution on USA,France,Germany and  Russia ‘have much in common’. Common features which they share include a democratic basis, providing for protection against the abuse of power, according a special role to political parties and having a version of the separation of powers and some system of checks and balance. Finally ,however the authors note that: in none of these does the constitution itself give a full accurate depiction of the policy each text operates within a matrix of custom,convention,case law, cautious compromises. In other words, to adopt professor king’s terminology once again, the Capital C constitution for each states represents but part of the over all picture. That picture ban only is viewed in its entirety by also having regard to each state’s small c constitutions.</p><p>All these things are indicating that we are deficient in the sense of toleration that is needed for a carrying out democracy and we are unfit to rule ourselves democratically. Regardless of the fact that the will of working together and the democratic values are something intangible, we cannot go on ignoring these facts without any punishment or harm. Sovereignty lies with the people and the Constitution is the embodiment and solemn expression of the will of the people<strong> – </strong>this declaration by the constitution must be privileged in practice.</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></em></strong></p><p>Bibliography</p><ol><li><em>1. </em><em>Bangladesh</em><em> shongbidhan er shobdo o khodo bakko-Habibur Rahman</em></li><li><em>2. </em><em>Parliamentary Guide-Jalal firoz</em></li><li><em>3. </em><em>National Bangladesh Constitutions</em></li><li><em>4. </em><em>Black’s Law dictionary</em></li><li><em>5. </em><em>Constitution and administrative Law-Nil parpworth and Nicola Padfield</em></li><li><em>6. </em><em>Constitution and administrative Law-Hilaire Barnett</em></li><li>(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution)</li><li>http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081002141727AAxcGVw</li><li>Wilson, J.

Government is the representative of the people of a country and the government runs the country according to the constitution. A constitution is a set of essential principles or conventional precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>. The rights and freedom of the citizens of a state is well described in the constitution of a specific state or country. So it’s the duty of the government to keep the sovereignty of its country and their citizens. In other words we can say that constitution reflects the will of the people and people’s rights and their sovereignty is kept by the government as directed in the constitution.</p><p><strong>Constitution</strong></p><p>The term <em>constitution</em> comes through <em>French</em> from the Latin word <em>constitutio</em>, used for regulations and orders, such as the imperial enactments (<em>constitutiones principis</em>: edicta, mandata, decreta, rescripta). Later, the term was widely used in cannon law for an important determination, especially a decree issued by the Pope, now referred to as an <em>apostolic constitution<a href="#_ftn2"><strong>[2]</strong></a>.</em></p><p><em> </em>A constitution is a set of laws that a set of people have prepared and agreed upon for government—often as a written document—that specified and limits the authority and task of a political entity. These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is. In the case of countries and autonomous regions of federal countries the term refers particularly to a constitution defining the fundamental political principles, and establishing the structure, procedures, powers and duties, of a government. By restraining the government’s own reach, most constitutions guarantee certain rights to the people<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>.</p><p>The word ‘constitution’ is commonly used in at least two senses in any ordinary discussion of political affairs. First of all it is used to describe the whole system of government of a country, the collection of rules which establish and regulate or govern the government. These rules are partly legal, in the sense that courts of law will recognize and apply them, and partly non-legal or extra-legal, taking the form of usages, understandings, customs, or conventions which courts do not recognize as law but which are not less effective in regulating the government than the rules of law strictly so called<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>.  <sup> </sup>Generally, every modern written constitution confers specific powers to an organization or institutional entity, established upon the primary condition that it abides by the said constitution’s limitations. According to Scott Gordon, a political organization is constitutional to the extent that it “contains institutionalized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and liberties of the citizenry including those that may be in the minority”<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>.</p><p>In almost every country in the world except Britain, the word ‘constitution’ is used in a narrower sense than this It is used to describe not the whole collection of rules, legal and non-legal, but rather a selection of them which has usually been embodied in one document or in a few closely related documents.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classifications:</span></strong></p><p>a) Written and Unwritten</p><p>b) Rigid and Flexible</p><p>c) Supreme and Subordinate</p><p>d) Federal and Unitary</p><p>e) Separated powers and fused powers</p><p>f) Republican and monarchical.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a) Written and Unwritten</span></strong></p><p>UK, New Zealand and Israel have unwritten constitutions.</p><p>The UK’s constitution is unwritten: due to history, the gradual development of the UK constitution, not necessary to frame a single document.</p><p>The sources of the UK constitution that are part written and part unwritten: conventions, works of authority, Acts of Parliament, the common law, and EU law.</p><p>A written constitution is one contained with a single document or a series of documents, with or without amendments, defining the basic rules of state.</p><p>The origins of written constitutions lie in the American War of Independence (1775-83) and French Revolution (1789).</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantages:</span></strong></p><p>1.  Written constitution is very definite where the people can refer to a document which contains all fundamental principles with regard to this structure and working of the government.</p><p>2.  The powers of the various organs are clearly defined in the constitution and there are fewer chances of confusion and disputes. If a dispute arises, it can be referred to the judiciary, whose duty is to decide it.</p><p>3.   It is usually stable and avoids the fear of uncertainty.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantages</span></strong></p><p>1. The major defect is rigid. It may not be-easy to amend the constitution to suit the<sup> </sup>changed circumstances.</p><p>2. Written constitution may fail to keep itself in touch with the changing needs of the society.

Judges become powerful<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p><p><strong>Sovereignty</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>A People permanently occupying a fixed territory bound together by common-law habits and custom into one body politic exercising, through the medium of an organized government, independent sovereignty and control over all persons and things within its boundaries, capable of making war and peace and of entering into international relations with other communities of the globe<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> (United States v. Kusche, D.C.Cal., 56 F.Supp. 201, 207, 208. The organization of social life which exercises sovereign power in behalf of the people. Delany v. Moraitis, C.C.A.Md., 136 F.2d 129, 130).</p><p>Sovereignty is the quality of having supreme, independent authority over a geographic area, such as a territory. It can be found in a power to rule and make law that rests on a political fact for which no purely legal explanation can be provided. In theoretical terms, the idea of “sovereignty”, historically, from Socrates to Thomas Hobbes, has always necessitated a moral imperative on the entity exercising it.</p><p>The currently only requires that a sovereign state has an effective and independent government within a defined territory. According to current international law norms, states are only required to have an effective and independent system of government pursuant to a community within a defined territory.</p><p>For centuries past, the idea that a state could be sovereign was always connected to its ability to guarantee the best interests of its own citizens. Thus, if a state could not act in the best interests of its own citizens, it could not be thought of as a “sovereign” state.</p><p>The concept of sovereignty has been discussed, debated and questioned throughout history, from the time of the Romans through to the present day. It has changed in its definition, concept, and application throughout, especially during the Age of Enlightenment. The current notion of state sovereignty is often traced back to the Peace of the Westphalia (1648), which, in relation to states, codified the basic principles:</p><ul><li>Territorial integrity</li><li>border inviolability</li><li>supremacy of the state (rather than the Church)</li></ul><ul><li>A sovereign is the supreme lawmaking authority within its jurisdiction<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Sovereignty &amp; People</strong></p><p>“There exists perhaps no conception the meaning of which is more controversial than that of sovereignty It is an indisputable fact that this conception, from the moment when it was introduced into political science until the present day, has never had a meaning which was universally agreed upon”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>.         –Lassa Oppenheim</p><p>Sovereignty is declared by the constitution and is a vital part of the constitution for people. Sovereignty gives people the right to move free all over the country and do what ever they like to do. If a country is not sovereign then the people of that country would not be able to practice their rights. In this way sovereignty ultimately lies with the people.</p><p>Where ever a person is born in a sovereign country or what ever class he belongs to or whoever his family members are that person automatically gets right to move freely and lead his life according to his will without the intervention of the government until his act is illegal by the law. This sovereignty of a country is kept protected by the government by the order of the constitution. Governments are made by the people and for the people and that government protects the sovereignty of the country for the people. So in this way sovereignty is for the people and lies with them.</p><p><strong>Relevant Legal Areas</strong></p><p>To talk about the relevant legal areas it generally means the Constitutional Law. Constitutional law is the fundamental law, without a constitution the legal system can not operate. A constitution is a set of rules, generally written, which identify and regulate the major institutions of the stale, i.e. the executive, the legislative and the judiciary; delineates their ambits of power and govern the inter-relationship between them; and explains the rights and freedoms of citizens. Constitutional law consist three issues: the institutions of the government, the powers of the government and the relationship between the government and the individual citizens<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> .</p><p>In all cases, except that of the United Kingdom, the fundamental provisions of the governmental system are set forth in a document or set of documents which, as a document, is called the constitution. Constitutional law, however, should not be taken to be synonymous with a constitution. The text of a constitution contains only a bare statement, in general terms, of those aspects of the question relating to the establishment of government as have been considered essential. From this one cannot know fully the constitutional law of a country, though he may form a fair idea about it. A constitution is the core or centre of the constitutional law of a country, but constitutional law is something more which gathers round a constitution in the form of legislation, judicial decisions and conventions and practices to complement it<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>.</p><p>Here I would like to describe the constitution and constitutional laws regarding Bangladesh-</p><p>The making of constitution of Bangladesh was leaded by the then law mister eminent lawyer Mr. Barrister Kamal Hossain in 1972 just one year after the Liberation War. The constitution of Bangladesh is the supreme law of Bangladesh. It declares Bangladesh as a secular democratic republic where sovereignty belongs to the people; and lays down the framework defining fundamental political principles of the state and spells out the fundamental rights of citizens. Passed by the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh on November 4, 1972, it came into effect from December 16, 1972, the day commemorated as Victory day in the country, marking the defeat of the Pakistan Army in the Bangladesh Liberation War<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> .</p><p>There are 3 basic organs of the state of Bangladesh as per constitution-</p><ol><li>Legislative Branch</li><li>Executive Branch</li><li>Judicial Branch</li></ol><p>The constitution of Bangladesh is divided into 11 parts and then they are also subdivided   into 153 articles.

This has led to the emergence of society and rules to regulate the conduct of the members of the society. The association was not, however, for mere companionship, but to achieve various objectives and purposes. Dealings between the individuals in the society invariably resulted in disputes. The need to settle disputes gave rise to leadership in the society and with the problem of protection of life and property came the concepts of allegiance and obedience. By a slow and intermittent process of social, economic and political evolution the State emerged as an indispensable institution run by an agency called the government. Constitution is the legal body which describes the structure of the organs of the government, their functions and their relationship with each other and with the citizens<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>. This constitution is made only for the citizens of specific sovereign countries and the constitution is the solemn expression of free will of people.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution</a></p><p>Constitutional Law, Retrieved from, <a href="http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/course-materials/constitutional-law-course-materials/constitutional-law/">http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/course-materials/constitutional-law-course-materials/constitutional-law/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/sovreign.htm">http://www.1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/sovreign.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty</a></p><p>Islam , M.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>The Constitution declares that the sovereignty lies with the people and the Constitution is the embodiment and solemn expression of the will of the people.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p align="center"><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>To run a state or country, there should be specific rules and regulation, codes of conduct. According to which peace and safety of a state is ensured. It is essential to make sure the safety of its citizen. Now a day citizens of a state are powerful enough to elect their representative as govt. to ensure the peace and safety of state and themselves as well. Then the govt. creates the constitution to reflect the citizen’s will and rights. The constitution of a nation is its supreme law, wherefrom the powers of government are derived and wherein the rights of the citizens of that nation are outlined. In many cases, a nation is established when its constitution is created. Constitutional litigation raises fundamental questions about what the constitution permits and forbids the government and citizens of a country to do.</p><p>“The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people; it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government – lest it come to dominate our lives and interests.”<a href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a></p><p align="center"><strong>Constitution</strong></p><p>A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. These principles together make up, i.e. constitute. When these principles are written down into a single or set of legal documents, those documents are said a written constitution.</p><p>In other word, a constitution is a system for government, codified as a written document or may be unwritten, which contains fundamental laws and principles. It usually contains basic political principles, and establishes the structure, procedures, powers and duties, of a government to run the state.<a href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a></p><pre>In short, a constitution is established/created by the sovereign people. It is a basic set of rules and regulation that governed the system of a particular society it can be written or unwritten.</pre><pre>Constitution can be two types:</pre><pre></pre><pre>1.             Written<em> (Constitution of the United States of America</em>)</pre><pre>2.             Unwritten (<em>British Constitution</em>)</pre><pre></pre><p>United Kingdom is the only country whose constitution is unwritten. The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any sovereign country in the world, while the United States Constitutions the shortest written constitution, at 7 articles and 27 amendments.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p align="center"><strong>Constitution around the world</strong></p><h3>Early constitutions</h3><p>Research found that in 1877at Iraq there was the evidence of the earliest known code of justice, issued by the Sumerian king Urukagina of Lagash <em>ca</em> 2300 BC. Perhaps the earliest model for a law of government, this document itself has not yet been discovered; however it is known that it allowed some rights to his citizens. So this code of conduct was initiated to ensure the interest of the general people. For example, it is known that it relieved tax for widows and orphans, and protected the poor from the usury of the rich.</p><h3>Later constitutions</h3><h4>Athens</h4><p>Back in those days, anarchy was more likely to get rise. In 621 BC a ruler named Draco codified the cruel oral laws of the city-state of Athens; this code prescribed the death penalty for many offences for the safety of the citizen. In 594 BC Solon, the ruler of Athens came up with the new <em>Solonian Constitution</em>. It eased the burden of the workers, and determined that membership of the ruling class was to be based on wealth (plutocracy), rather than by birth (aristocracy). This constitution was mainly designed to evaluate peoples’ performance to achieve power. Aristotle (<em>ca</em> 350 BC) is said one of the first in recorded history to submit a formal distinction between ordinary law and constitutional law. He establishes ideas of constitution and constitutionalism, and finally he attempted to classify different forms of constitutional government to provide safety, right and freedom to different classes of people.</p><h4>Rome</h4><p>Business and banking system was initiated in Rome. So, people needed some sort of rules and regulation to protect their interest. The Romans first codified their constitution in 450 BC as the <em>Twelve Tables</em>. They operated under a series of laws and this law was adjustable with time which means laws were added from time to time, but Roman law was never reorganized into a single code until the <em>Codex Theodosianus</em> (AD 438); later, in the Eastern Empire the <em>Code repetitæ prælectionis</em> (534) was highly influential throughout Europe.</p><p><strong>India</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p>The Constitution spells out the basic structure of government under which the people are to be governed. India is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a parliamentary system of government. It establishes the regulatory system of government – the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. These organs work for the government to ensure the systematic peace of the state. The Constitution not only defines the powers of each organ, but also distinguishes their responsibilities. It controls the relationship between the different organs and between the government and the people to work with harmony. The Constitution is superior to all other laws of the country. Every law enacted by the government has to be in conformity with the Constitution. The Constitution lays down the national goals of India – Democracy, Socialism, Secularism and National Integration. It also spells out the rights and duties of citizens.<a href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a></p><p><strong>Japan</strong></p><p>Japan’s <em>Seventeen-article constitution</em> written in 604, is an early example of a constitution in Asian political history. Constitution was influenced by Buddhist teachings, the document focuses more on social morality than institutions of government <em>per se</em> and remains a notable early attempt at a government constitution. “Now the constitution provides for a parliamentary system of government and guarantees certain fundamental rights.”<sup>2 </sup>In fact in Japan political system uses a multi-party system. Prime minister is the head of the government and executive power is exercised by the government. The rights and duties of the people are prominently featured in the postwar constitution. Thirty one of its 103 articles are created to describing the commitment to the respect of fundamental human rights.</p><p><strong>Medina</strong></p><p>Another very ancient constitution is the <em>Constitution of Medina</em>, drafted by the prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in 622. It is said to be one of the earliest constitutions which guarantees basic rights to religions and adherents as well as reinforcing a judiciary process regarding the rules of warfare, tax and civil disputes to run a country. After the hijra a short written constitution was documented. It effectively established the first Islamic state. The security of the community, religious, freedom, the security of wemen, stable tribal relation in Medina was some of the key issues of that constitution.</p><p><strong>England</strong></p><p>In England, King John initiated <em>Magna Carta</em> in 1215. The most important single article of the <em>Magna Carta</em> provided that the king was not permitted to imprison, outlaw, exile or kill anyone at a whim—there must be due process of law first. This article, Article 39, of the <em>Magna Carta</em> read:</p><p>“No free man shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his property, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor shall we go against him or send against him, unless by legal judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.”</p><p>This provision became the fundamental basis of English liberty after that point. The social contract in the original case was between the king and the nobility, but was gradually extended to all of the people. Taking that concept into consideration, It led to the system of Constitutional Monarchy. At present England has no single core constitutional document. The country has an uncodified constitution. The main unwritten sources are parliamentary constitutional conventions and royal prerogatives.</p><p> </p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>In China, the Hongwu Emperor created and refined a document he called <em>Ancestral Injunctions</em> (first published in 1375, revised twice more before his death in 1398). These rules served in a very real sense as a constitution for the Ming Dynasty for the next 250 years. Now a day the constitution of people republic of china is the is the highest law with in the country. Recent constitution consists of five section- preamble, general principal, fundamental right and duties of the citizen, structure of state, the national flag and the emblems of the state.<a href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a></p><p align="center"><strong>Constitution in Bangladesh</strong></p><p>Bangladesh is a unitary, independent, sovereign Republic to be known as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. We, the people of Bangladesh, have proclaimed our Independence on the 26th day of March, 1971 and through a historic war for national independence. Nationalism, democracy and socialism meaning economic and social justice are the fundamental principles of the Constitution. Our constitution ensures the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social security for all citizens. Respecting the constitution, it is our sacred duty to safeguard, protect and defend this Constitution as the constitution talks about the citizen and its wale fare. So as a citizen we have to maintain its supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh. Hence we may prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards international peace and co-operation in keeping with the progressive aspirations of mankind.<a href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a></p><p> </p><p align="center"><strong>The objective of constitution</strong></p><p>Basically these are the task to perform which a constitution of a state is made of. May be the constitution is different from country to country. But the objectives constitution fulfills are pretty much same regardless countries.</p><ol><li>Look at the Preamble</li><li>To create a more efficient and appropriate type of government (the Articles did not work very well).</li><li>Create a system that will be fair to all.</li><li>To protect the common person and their family and their rights and their dignities and their pursuit of happiness.</li><li>Encourage humanity, innovation, etc.</li><li>To make sure our freedom and all of our descendants as well.<a href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a></li></ol><p align="center"><strong>What constitution Does and does not Do</strong></p><p>The founding fathers established the Constitution to do just two things:</p><ol start="1"><li>Establish a state/federal government</li><li>Delegate to the federal government certain, limited (and enumerated) powers.</li></ol><p>The Constitution was written by the thirteen original states. The federal government created by the states, via the Constitution, exists to serve the states. Until the states delegated <em>some</em> powers to the new federal government, those powers belonged to the states. The states, of course, delegated only some of their powers to the federal government while retaining most of their powers for themselves. And this power holds by the citizen of the state.</p><p>The Constitution does not give citizen rights. The founders considered citizen’s rights to be “God-given” or “natural rights” — citizens are born with all his rights. The constitution does,<strong> </strong>however, protect citizen’s rights by:</p><ul><li>Limiting the powers of government by granting to it only those specific powers that are listed in the Constitution.</li><li>Enumerating certain, specific rights which you retain from the state being citizen.</li></ul><p>The rights which are consider most important are listed in the bill of right. But with the time being some rights are arisen to be most important but are not listed in bill of right. This is why bill of right also says that even though some emerging right is not listed as a governing state you maintain that right. Any powers not specifically delegated by the Constitution to the federal government are retained by the states and the people (you).<a href="#_ftn7" title="">[7]</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p align="center"><strong>Constitution upholds people’s right and freedom</strong></p><p>Constitution ensures the freedom of expression of its citizen in respective country .they can hold ideas, share it with others. If they do not want, on one can interfere in it. Government also put restriction to protect the disclosure of the confidential information of the judicial system. The state protects the basic right of the citizen. Govt. ensures education for its citizen. It also takes care of the citizen’s health. In some countries constitution banned child labor. State takes the responsibility to protect wealth and life of its citizen. It ensures legal system to implement the rules and regulation of the constitution. People can do whatever they like unless until it is prohibited by law. This is the think people demand from state. Even people got the voting right to chose their representative as a citizen of the state. To make people’s life easy, comfortable, safe and sound constitution is there. Hence, constitution protects citizen’s social, economical, political and legal right.<a href="#_ftn8" title="">[8]</a></p><p align="center"><strong>Finding relationship among constitution, sovereignty and people</strong></p><p>Constitution works like a guideline to run the state. Analyzing several countries’ constitutions we can see that constitution is made considering the interest of people. No matter whether the government system is democratic or republic, constitution always speaks by the favor of people. Economic, social, political, legal, religious demands are reflected in constitution. To run the state safe and soundly, whatever rules and regulation is needed that will be the basic of constitution. This is because people holds right by born. So they elect government as their representative to protect their interest. So it is government who works for people. So, it is government responsibility to come up with innovative ideas, rules and regulation to look after the citizen. So everything should be well being of people. Government is accountable to people for all its action. If the government focuses somewhere else, fail to protect citizens’ interest, fail to provide safety, fail to fulfill basic need, people can replace the government. The procedure is in the constitution that people can replace the govt. if the Govt. fails to protect its interest. So, we can see govt. exercise some power written in constitution given by the citizen. But the ultimate power remains in peoples’ hand. Hence we can say, constitution is the expression of the logical will of the people and the sovereignty lies with people.</p><p align="center"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In today’s world people hold all the power being citizen. So the constitution is made behalf of them. Basically constitution talks about the people. Power is distributed according to constitution. The constitution creates a relation between the state and the citizen. This relation is based on Government’s accountability. If things are going wrong, there is a dispute between govt. and citizens. Then citizen exercise their supreme power to replace the government. This is how people maintain sovereignty to protect their free will (constitution).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><strong>Reference</strong></p><p>Cutzman, K.R.C.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Constitution declares that the sovereignty lies with the people and the Constitution is the embodiment and solemn expression of the will of the people- Explain and Illustrate.</span></strong></p><p>The modern republican form of democratic government is based on the concept of the right of the people to govern themselves through their own elected representatives.”Those representatives are the agents of the people. They govern the country for and on behalf of the people at large. But those very ordinary people are the owners of the country and such superiority is recognized in the Constitution,” asserted Justice Haque<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</p><p>In the world, people play a vital role to start a new era and to continue an existing situation as well. So it is very important to have a potential kind of people who can take important decision when it is needed. That is why sovereignty is one of the most important elements. We can tell a nation sovereign when they have territory of their own, population and they have their own government. All of those things are possible only then when there are people. So it is true that sovereignty lies with the people.</p><p>All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be affected only under, and by the authority of, the Constitution. “This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Constitution</span></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Constitution is the one of the most important law for the people of a country which is related to the state and for all institution and legal entities under it. These rules are used for setting the people’s culture, tradition and the countries entity in mind. All countries of the world have few basic characteristics in their Constitution and these rules are to ensure that the basic rights of the people are protected. Constitution also plays an important role to set the rules for forming the rules and regulations for the government, for constructing political party and for arranging the election of the country. All political parties, organizations and institutions set their internal rules according to the constitution of the country so Constitution is very important for a country. The basic principle of the Constitution is to serve the people, organizations and institutions by providing them a proper guide line which is appropriate for the country.</p><p>The preface of the Constitution also required its aims and objectives and speaks for its supremacy. Unlike the starting of many other countries, the starting of our original Constitution has laid down exposed in clear terms.  The aims and objectives of the Constitution was so unclear and in certain terms it spoke of representative democracy, rule of law, and the supremacy of the Constitution as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh. Even the validity of a law is tested by the benchmark of the Constitution: but there is no such benchmark to test validity of the Constitution. Its validity is natural and as such it is unchallengeable.</p><p>The most common confusion was over sovereignty ever since the American Revolution founded the United States on a revolutionary concept of it.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Constitution and Sovereignty in the world</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>According to Harley G A Wright it was natural once the conflict with Britain reached the stage where independence was the only real alternative to submission that the men of the Revolution should turn to constitution making.</p><p>1. INTRODUCTION of Constitution After 1992</p><p>2. In Constitutional law, it was appeared to many that the High Court had adopted a new norm of constitutional interpretation: “parliamentary sovereignty” was replaced with “sovereignty of the people”.</p><p>3. This change was most marked in the “free speech” cases.</p><p>While some celebrated with promises of a new sense of citizenship and revitalized democratic traditions others saw these promises as empty and warned that judicial implication of rights threatened positivist legal values and judicial independence.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p><p>1998 Sovereignty of the People – The New Constitutional norm 167 PART I – SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PARLIAMENT OR SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE – THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK Rooted in the basic norm, ultimately, is the normative import of all the material facts constituting the legal system. A shift in the basic norm of constitutional interpretation compels examination, in both the old norm and the new, of the fundamental assumptions made about the people, the political process, the judiciary and the relationships between them. To focus such a potentially broad discussion, it is necessary to analyze the points at which the theoretical structures underlying each norm compete and clash. The familiarity of many of these arguments is perhaps explained by their thematic nature; the issues sketched below recur in different guises throughout constitutional discourse and lie at the bottom of many constitutional disagreements.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p><p>As the most renowned legal minds have always known, cogency depends upon acknowledging the unknowable. 191 Part of the attractiveness and persistence of Diceyan theory is its open embrace of its limits, its open reliance upon political solutions in the extreme case. It is fitting perhaps, as the “inevitable” republic advances and as the constitutional ties with Britain are severed, “that the men of the Revolution should turn to constitution making”. However there are doubts as to the identity of the constitution makers. It should not be the responsibility of the judiciary alone. The revolution lacks just one thing – the consent of the sovereign people. 190 191 Wade has noted that “The closer judges come to constitutional bedrock the more prone to disorientation they seem to be”: H R W Wade and C Forsyth, Administrative Law, (7 ed 1994) at vi, cited by Justice Kirby, “The Struggle For Simplicity – Lord Cooke and Fundamental Rights”, speech delivered at the New Zealand Legal Research Foundation, 45 April 1997 at 59. As Dixon J stated in Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth [1947] HCA 26 ; (1947) 74 CLR 31 at 82, “[ilt is not a question whether the considerations are political, for nearly every consideration arising from the Constitution can be so described, but whether they are compelling.” In a similarly open characterization, Sir Anthony Mason has referred to judgment as involving “objective and principled elaboration”: A Mason, “The Role of a Constitutional Court in a Federation: a Comparison of the Australian and the United States Experience” (1986) 16 F L Rev 1 at 28.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Constitution in Bangladesh</span></strong></p><p>The political government and military usurpers disregarded the supremacy of the Constitution and undermined the people’s sovereignty in the name of amendments since 1973. Of the total of 14 amendments made until 2004, only the eleventh and twelfth amendments got the consensus of both ruling and opposition parties.</p><p>The most fundamental, and in some cases nefarious, of those changes were brought through the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth amendments. Many changes made with ulterior motives largely destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution and also damaged the parliament’s power and pre-eminence. In bringing amendments, the political and military rulers did not pay heed to the true spirit of amendment of the Constitution. In fact, the purpose of the two infamous amendments — fifth and seventh — was to hide and legalize illegal acts of military dictators of the two martial law regimes.</p><p>Therefore, the amendments contributed little for further advancement of the country’s citizens and further refinements of their constitutional position. Rather, successive governments abused the parliament’s authority in some cases to amend the Constitution.</p><p>Article 142 gives power to parliament to amend any provision of the Constitution by way of addition, alteration, substitution or repeal. Legal experts state a constitution is meant to be permanent, but as all changing situations cannot be envisaged and amendment of the Constitution may be necessary to adopt the future developments, provision is made in the Constitution itself to effect changes required by the changing situations.</p><p>“Addition, alteration, substitution or repeal are merely modes of amendment and if the act done does not come within the meaning of ‘amendment,’ it will not be valid, notwithstanding that all the procedural requirements have been fulfilled,” said former attorney general Mahmudul Islam in his book titled Constitutional Law of Bangladesh. He said that, when a legislature, which is a creature of the Constitution, is given the power of amendment, it is a power given not to subvert the Constitution, but to make it suitable to the changing situations. But, nothing was able to prevent the political governments and particularly military rulers from undermining the supremacy of the Constitution.</p><p>The constitution of Bangladesh also highlights on the role and rights of the people of Bangladesh. Some of the articles including article7, article27, and article31 express the right and equality given to the people of Bangladesh and it is obvious from the preamble that this constitution is opting for a democratic government in order to protect the fundamental human rights and leave in harmony beyond any form of discrimination.</p><p>“Those representatives (referring to the Member of Parliament who is selected by the people under the constitutional law) are the agents of the people. They govern the country for and on behalf of the people at large. But those very ordinary people are the owners of the country and their superiority is recognized in the Constitution,” – justice ABM Khairul Haque. The statement states that the core intention of the constitution of Bangladesh is to provide the power in the hand of the mass people through a democratic government.</p><p>Article 7 of the Constitution stipulates its supremacy and recognizes people’s power as it says: “All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be affected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution.” This article also refers to the power that the people of Bangladesh posses according to the constitution. It also says: “This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.”</p><p>Former Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed in the landmark verdict on the Constitution Eighth Amendment case found that Bangladesh’s Constitution stands on certain fundamental principles, which are its structural pillars and if those pillars are demolished or damaged, the whole constitutional edifice will break down. He listed the following to be the basic structures of the Constitution, namely — sovereignty belongs to the people, supremacy of the Constitution as the solemn expression of the will of the people, democracy, republican government, unitary state, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary and the fundamental rights.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p><p>The opening of the Constitution also stipulates its aims and objectives and speaks for its supremacy. “Unlike Preamble of many other countries, the Preamble of our original Constitution has laid down bare in clear terms the aims and objectives of the Constitution and in no uncertain terms it spoke of representative democracy, rule of law, and the supremacy of the Constitution as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh,” the Appellate Division asserted in the case of the Fifth Amendment.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p><p>From overall discussion we found that Constitution is very important embodiment for a country. By the Constitution a country get some rules and regulations by which they become able to drive the country properly. By the rules and regulations of the Constitution a country get the way to drive different industry, business and organization. As a result Constitution is very important. But all over the world in the Constitutional Law even in Bangladesh also we found that people play a vital role to complete all the things in an efficient way. So People are the main player of the Constitution and constitution is the perfect embodiment for a country.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><ol><li>Confusion and our Constitution. <em>The      Daily Star.</em> Retrieved June       11,2011 From <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/forum/2010/November/chaos.htm">http://www.thedailystar.net/forum/2010/November/chaos.htm</a></li><li>Retrieved June 10,2011 From <a href="http://www.constitution.org/aun/aun1--07.htm">http://www.constitution.org/aun/aun1–07.htm</a></li><li>Sovereignty of the people-the new      grandnorm.

The philosopher Aristotle (384–322 b.c.), in his work Politics<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn5">[5]</a>, analyzed over 150 Greek constitutions. He described a constitution as creating the frame upon which the government and laws of a society are built.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sources:</span></strong></p><p>There are many sources of constitution. They are listed below:</p><p>1)      An act of parliament: An act of parliament is generally the highest form of law.  A draft act of Parliament is known as a bill. Once passed by the parliament it becomes a part of the constitution.</p><p>2)      Common Law: The decisions of judges through the interpretation of statutes or through development of the common law are a source of constitutional law.</p><p>3)      The law and customs of the parliament</p><p>4)      The Royal Prerogative or the prerogatives of the President of the country.<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn6">[6]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Codification<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn7"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[7]</span></strong></a>:</span></strong></p><p>A fundamental classification is codification or lack of codification.

Through these doctrines and a proper separation of powers<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn8">[8]</a>, we can say that the sovereignty lies with the people.</p><p><strong>a) </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rule of Law:</span></strong></p><p>The rule of law is one of the fundamental concepts or principles of the constitution. An ideal constitution demands that society must be governed by law and all must be equally subject to the law. British jurist A.V. Dicey<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn9">[9]</a> popularized the phrase “rule of law” in 1885.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong>b) </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sovereignty of Parliament: </span></strong>Parliamentary sovereignty is a principle part of a constitution. It makes Parliament<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn10">[10]</a> the supreme legal authority in a country, which can create or end any law. Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. By making law for the people a parliament represents the citizens of it country.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>c) </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Separation of Power: </span></strong>Constitutions introduces us to the doctrine of separation of powers. It is a doctrine which states that the three bodies of the government check &amp; balance their powers. It ensures that no abuse of power takes place that can harm people.<strong></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Constitution of Bangladesh:</span></strong></p><p>The <strong>Constitution of Bangladesh</strong> is the supreme law of Bangladesh. It declares Bangladesh as a secular democratic republic where sovereignty belongs to the people. The constitution of Bangladesh declares Bangladesh as a secular democratic republic where sovereignty belongs to the people. Passed by the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh on November 4, 1972, it came into effect from December 16, 1972, the day commemorated as Victory Day in the country, marking the defeat of the Pakistan Army in the Bangladesh Liberation War.</p><p>The Constitution of Bangladesh is divided into 11 parts containing 153 Articles.</p><p>The Preamble<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn11">[11]</a> of the Bangladesh Constitution states that This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, is void.</p><p>Article 7 of the Constitution recognizes people’s power as it says: “All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be affected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution.”</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does the Bangladesh Constitution reflect the will of the people?</span></strong></p><p>Justice ABM Khairul Haque<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn12">[12]</a>, in the landmark verdict on the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment case, said “the modern republican form of democratic government is based on the concept of the right of the people to govern themselves through their own elected representatives. Those representatives are the agents of the people. They govern the country for and on behalf of the people at large. But those very ordinary people are the owners of the country and their superiority is recognized in the Constitution”</p><p>When enacted in 1972, the Constitution of Bangladesh was hailed by international jurists and legal historians and as one of the most progressive and democratic constitutions in modern history and one that inspired progressive political aspirations among third world countries and populations struggling for self-determination. However, amendments during socialist one party and military rule in Bangladesh radically altered the secular and liberal democratic nature of the constitution.</p><p>In bringing amendments,<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn13">[13]</a> the political and military rulers did not pay heed to the true spirit of amendment of the Constitution.</p><p>Therefore, the amendments contributed little for further advancement of the country’s citizens and further refinements of their constitutional position. Rather, successive governments abused the parliament’s authority in some cases to amend the Constitution.</p><p>Given the dynamic nature of our society, it has gone through a number of changes, as has been the case with many such documents, and it is also expected that it will go through further refinement in the future, with the betterment of people’s welfare in mind. But in the final analysis, what is important is that the Constitution would bring about within our society a balance between change and stability, tolerance and competition, opportunity and meritocracy.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How constitutions protect the rights of the citizens?</span></strong></p><p>I will provide two examples where we will see that rights are protected by constitution.</p><p>The Human Rights Act 1998 is an Act of Parliament of the United   Kingdom which received Royal Assent on 9 November 1998, and mostly came into force on 2 October  2000. Its aim is to “give further effect” in UK law to the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. I will state some of the rights provided in the act below:</p><p>1)     Article 2- Right to life</p><p>2)     Article 5- Right to liberty &amp; security</p><p>3)     Article 6- Right to fair trial</p><p>4)     Article 10- Freedom of expression</p><p>I will provide some of the fundamental rights<a href="file://projjal/D/Projjal%20Documentation%202011/Web%20Developed/ASSIGNMENT%202011/The%20Constitution_1.doc#_ftn15">[15]</a> provided by Part 3 of the Bangladesh Constitution:</p><p>1)     Laws inconsistent with fundamental rights to be void.</p><p>2)     Equality before law. All citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law.</p><p>3)     Protection of right to life and personal liberty. No person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty saves in accordance with law.</p><p>If we compare the Bangladesh &amp; UK constitution on the basis of fundamental rights, we will find that both tries protect the rights of the citizens.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How constitutions get violated:</span></strong></p><p>Constitutions can be hampered by many situations. I will provide two examples:</p><p>A constitutional amendment is a formal change to the text of the written constitution of a country. Amendments of constitutions can destroy the true spirits of it. Most constitutions require that amendments cannot be enacted unless they have passed a special procedure that is more stringent than that required of ordinary legislation.</p><p>Martial law is the imposition of military rules by military authorities over a country or region on an emergency basis when the civilian government or civilian authorities fail to function effectively. Under a military rule the constitution could be suspended and the ruler removes all power from the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the federal government.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Views<sup> </sup>&amp; Suggestions:</span></strong></p><p>My view on this topic is that usually oppressed people of a country gain their freedom through revolutions or liberation wars where they sacrifice a lot. And after the long awaited freedom, the first thing they want to do is protect their rights. Through constitution they can express their views. They write their constitution to express their wish for a better future. So the purpose of the constitution is to hand over the power to its citizens. I think that the constitution of a country should never be suspended or changed against the will of its citizens. The constitution can only be protected and fruitful when a government is run by an elected parliamentary body.  It is the only that way the people of a country can take part in evaluating the constitution.</p><p>I also want to state that an independent judiciary is absolutely mandatory for a country.  Though almost every constitutions of the world declare the independence of judiciary, in practical it is tough to achieve. I think that the other parts of the government should make enough sacrifices for the sake of the people and take necessary steps to make a effective and free judiciary.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion:</span></strong></p><p>We like to think that constitutions are drafted to protect our fundamental rights. But it’s not always the case. And it should be said that a constitution is not the act of government, but of a people constituting a government and a government without a constitution is power without right. The Constitution is considered the supreme law of the land both because of its content and because its authority is derived from the people.  The concepts and ideas of the Constitution are the higher law, things which a government cannot create or destroy. Among these concepts and ideas is the notion that the people are sovereign and that legitimate governments must be based on popular consent. Because a Constitution is ratified by the representatives of the people, it is a document, in both word and deed, created by and for the people.  So we can say that constitution is the embodiment and solemn expression of the will of the people.</p><p><strong>Bibliography:</strong></p><ol><li><em> </em></li></ol><ol><li><em> </em></li></ol><p><em>10. </em><em>JSTOR</em></p><p><em>11. </em><em>Constitutional Sovereignty.

9214	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE CONSTITUTION OF BANGLADESH, 1972</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Chapter – 1.</p><p>1.1  Aims and objectives:</p><p>By instinct man is gregarious and lives in company of his fellow beings. This led to the emergence of society and the rules to regulate the conduct of the members of the society. The association was not, however, for mere companionship, but to achieve various objectives and purposes. The modern formation of man and society is the formation of State. State is run by following a supreme law of the land. The Supreme law of our laws is called the constitution of the people’s Republic of Bangladesh, which was had in 1972. The aims and objectives of the amendment of Bangladesh Constitution 1972 and their impact in Legal History are stated below:</p><p>(1)  To understand and realize the amendment of Bangladesh Constitution 1972.</p><p>(2)  To assess the impact of the amendment in the legal History.</p><p>(3)  To assess the impact of the amendment in the practical activities of the whole citizens.</p><p>(4)  To recommend in avoiding the lacuna of the amended constitutional provisions.</p><p>1.2  Importance of the study:</p><p>The emergence of State speaks the administrative system for protecting the interest of its citizens. It is the fundamental duties of the state to protect the inalienable or fundamental rights of the citizens. The importance of the amendment of Bangladesh constitution 1972 is undeniable in terms of the inalienable rights of Bangladeshi citizens. They are as follows:</p><p>(1)  to identify whether the amendment of the constitution has contracted the fundamental rights.</p><p>(2)  to recommend in avoiding the lacuna for safeguarding and upgrading the fundamental rights.</p><p>1.3  Scope and limitations</p><p>Scope of the study:</p><p>Every law contains a periphery or a scope, At the same time, it keeps some limitations. Nothing has absolute scope except the absolute being or entity.</p><p>The scope of the study is determined within the boundary of the amended constitutional provisions of 1972 constitution. Hence it is indispensable to project the amended constitutional provision based legal area.</p><p>1.4) Limitation of the study:</p><p>The given research monograph does not permit to criticize or discuss about the constitutional lacuna of Bangladesh constitution, 1972. There are many lacunas of Bangladesh constitution, 1972 for which the entire good governance and the fundamental human rights of the citizens are destroyed. Here is no scope to discuss or criticize about the basis /foundation. It is necessary to discuss about the severe lacuna based Law. The constitution of Bangladesh, 1972 itself contains some severe lacunas which are not pertinent of the given research monograph. The limitations like the following example.</p><p>Mr. Aziz is an engineer. He is empowered to examine and report from the first to 13th floor except the ground floor and the foundation of a building.</p><p>1.5  Research Methodology:</p><p>Data have been generated from both the primary and secondary sources:</p><p>In order to understand the deepness of the given research monograph, I have first of all, collected all amendments, the original constitution of Bangladesh, 1972 and other related documents. Then I have discussed about the amendments of the constitution and finally have thought very deeply again and again. By this methodology, I have completed the research monograph.</p><p>A combination of methods have been. applied to obtain data which included:</p><p>–     Observation with a checklist.</p><p>–     Study of Bangladesh (Original) constitution of 1972.</p><p>–     Study of Bangladesh Constitution (amended up to 1998)</p><p>–     Discussion with experts and others.</p><p>1.6  Research Policy:</p><p>Although there is no enlightened policy in our country in the domain of research. I have tried to follow the ‘Research Action Policy1 It has been applies to the best of my ability.</p><p>2.1  Commonly it is known to us that constitution the supreme or basic law of a country. The administrators according to constitution run the entire administrative system of any state. So a constitution is, there fore, the basic design of the structure and powers of the government and the rights and duties of its citizens. There can be no state without a constitution. Sometimes the constitution of a state is definitely formulated in a document or documents; sometimes it is found in an established body of rules, maxims, traditions and practices in accordance with which its government is organized and its powers are exercised”1</p><p>2.2Meaning of amendment:</p><p>The word amendment denotes “the removal of faults or errors, reformation. 1 In the constitutional law amendment means the removal or the reformation of the constitutional provision for the purpose of equipping with the present and future needs of the citizens. Again, the word amend may have Different nuances of meaning in different contexts, like ‘amend one’s conduct; “amend a letter or a document” “amend a pleading” “amend a law” “amend a Constitution”. We are concerned with the last one, namely, what an amendment means in the context of a Constitution that contains an amending clause. In the Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. 1 the word ‘amend’ is stated to mean “to make professed improvements in (a measure before Parliament); formally, to alter in detail, though practically it may be to alter its principle so as to thwart it.”1</p><p>It is indispensable to keep a provision of amending the provision of the constitution. So, “Article–142 of the constitution confers power on parliament to amend the  Constitution For such amendment there are some procedural requirements. A bill for amendment of the constitution must contain a long title expressly stating that it will amend a provision of the constitution. It was contended that the long title must specifically mention which provision is sought to be amended, otherwise the amendment passed will be void. The Majority decision of the Appellate Division is that the  specific provision need not be mentioned in the Bill and the requirement will be fulfilled if the long title states that certain provision or provisions is or are sought to be amended.2</p><p>This bill paned by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total number of members of Parliament shall be presented to the President for his assent. The president shall assent to the Bill within sever days of the presentation of the Bill if that Bill is pared by the required majority assent. If he fails to assent within that time he shall be deemed to have assented to the Bill. But in case of amending the preamble, or any of the provisions of arts. 8,48,56, and 142, the President shall within seven days of Presentation of the Bill for his assent cause it to be refereed to a referendum. It is seen that the majority votes in the referendum are in favour of the amendment the president shall be deemed to have assented to the Bill. Otherwise the president shall be deemed to have withheld his assent from the Bill, the procedural requirements are mandatory. and if these are not followed the amendment will be void.</p><p>2.2. Important features of Bangladesh constitution, 1972.</p><p>1)   Preamble: The constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh has a clear Preamble in which it has been stated that.</p><p>Further pledging that it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realize through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation a society in which the rule of law fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens”</p><p>2)   Supremacy of the constitution:</p><p>Bangladesh constitution, 1972 has the supremacy which is ensured in article 7 (2) of it. It provides that “this constitution is…. the supreme law of the republic and if any other law is inconsistent with this constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.</p><p>3)   Unitary Governmental system:</p><p>According to article 1 of Bangladesh constitution. 1972, there is a system of Unitary government. All powers is centralized in the hand of a unitary government.</p><p>4)   Fundamental principles of state policy: Article  8 of Bangladesh constitution 1972 provides for major fundamental principles of state policy. They are-</p><p>(i)   Nationalism,</p><p>(ii)  Democracy,</p><p>(iii) Socialism,</p><p>(iv) Secularism, All other principles derived from these four shall also constitute the fundamental principles of State policy.</p><p>5)   Fundamental Rights:</p><p>Eighteen fundamental rights are guaranteed in chap (iii) Bangladesh constitution, 1972. The enjoyment and enforcement of these rights have been guaranteed in the constitution.</p><p>6)   Parliamentary form of Government:</p><p>The constitution of Bangladesh 1972, provides for a west minister type of parliamentary system.</p><p>7)   Independence of Judiciary:</p><p>The constitution of Bangladesh 1972 ensured the Independence of Judiciary.</p><p>8)   Ombudsman:</p><p>Article 77 of Bangladesh constitution, 1972 has spoken about the establishment of the office of the Ombudsman.</p><p>2.3) Amendments of Bangladesh constitution 1972:</p><p>From the commencement of Bangladesh constitution, 1972, there has been 13 amendments, a summery of all the amendments is given,</p><p>Summery of 13 Amendments:</p><p>Amendments     Date      Summery of substance</p><p>1st Amendment 15th July, 1973 To make way for prosecution of genocide, crime against humanity and war crimes committed in the liberation war of 1971.</p><p>2nd Amendment      22nd September, 1973   Inclusion of emergency provision, suspension of fundamental rights and preventive detention.</p><p>3rd Amendment 28th November 1974     To give effect to the boundary line treaty between Bangladesh and India.</p><p>4th Amendment       25th January 1975   One party dictatorial system was substituted for a responsible parliamentary system.</p><p>5th Amendment       6th April, 1979  Legalizing all acts done by the first Military Authority.</p><p>6th Amendment 10th July 1981  To make way for the Vice president to be a candidate in president election.</p><p>7th Amendment 10th November 1986     Legalizing all acts done by the 2nd Military Authority.</p><p>8th Amendment 9th June, 1988   Setting up six permanent Benches of the High cornet Division and making Islam the state religion.</p><p>9th Amendment 11th July 1989  Direct election of the president and the Vice president simultaneously.</p><p>10th Amendment     23rd June 1990 Period for reservation of 30 Women members seats in the parliament wad extended for 10 years.</p><p>11th Amendment     10th August 1991    Legalizing the appointment of Shahabuddin Ahmed.

They committed war crimes, crime against humanity, genocide and other crimes under international law. By this amendment a new clause in Article 47 was inserted (clause-3) which allowed the parliament to make any law for the trial of war criminals “1 It is worthy to mention here that under the authority of this amendment the parliament passed within a weeks the international criminal (Tribunal) Act for the trial of 195 prisoners of war; But all initiative of the government to try them ended in a failure due to tricks played by Bhutlo” 2</p><p>2nd Amendment:</p><p>In the constitution of Bangladesh 1972, Thee were no Provisions for prevention detention or emergency situation because “during the British colonial rule and then 3 years constitutional history of Pakistan the arbitrary application of preventive detention law and emergency was so bitter that it left a good teaching to the AL that such provision which are contradictory to the concept of nourishing living democracy, would never allow to build normal democratic system. To maintain the colloquial state the British government used these laws under the government of India Act 1935 as necessary weapons to crash the opposition and perpetuates their rule. And launders and thousands of Indians and their leaders had to suffer imprisonment without trial for an indefinite period. After partition the two governor-generals of Pakistan Golam Mohammad and Iskander Mirja used the power of emergency to perpetuate their rule and thereby destroyed all the political institutions. … and hundreds of citizens were put into prison for years together without trial. This bitter experience led the Awami League to make an avowed commitment since the formation of United front in 1954 to repeal not only these black laws but also to remove any scope or prerogative enabling an individual to retard the process of demaoucracy”1</p><p>But unfortunately on 22nd September 1973 the then members of the parliament passed the 2nd amendment in exercising and expending their administrative power.</p><p>3rd Amendment:</p><p>This was done for giving effect to an agreement between Bangladesh and India. The agreement was based on some changes of boundary lines between them.</p><p>4th Amendment:</p><p>By 4th amendment the Presidential form of government was introduced in line of parliamentary form of government. It was interdicted by amending article 48(1) of the constitution of Bangladesh 1972.</p><p>Article 48(1) of Bangladesh Constitution 1972:</p><p>“There shall be of Bangladesh who shall be elected by members of Parliament in accordance with the provisions contained in the second schedule. 1”</p><p>Article 48(1) of (amended) Bangladesh consultation, 1972.:</p><p>“There shall a president of Bangladesh who shall be elected by members of Parliament in accordance with law”2</p><p>In amending article 48(1), the second schedule of original 1972 constitution of Bangladesh was repealed. Besides, “In true Presidential system, as there is the doctrine of separation of power, no minister can be a member of Parliament. But in the 4th amendment it was provided that the president could appoint Ministers from among the members of the parliament or from outside [Art. 58(3)].

These are all about the fundamental subject matters of all amendments.</p><p>2.5) What do you mean by the term impact?</p><p>Impact:</p><p>The word ‘Impact’ means commonly the effective action of one thing or person upon another; the effect of such action; influence impression.1 new ton’s third law Every action has its equal and opposite reaction implies the impact of the action. i.e. the impact of the amendments.</p><p>All the amendments has impact in Legal History that’s why, 13 amendments of Bangladesh Constitution have the impacts which are important in our legal field as well as in our practical life 13 constitutional amendment’s impacts are stated here.</p><p>2.6) The impacts of the amendments in the Legal History.</p><p>Impact of 1st Amendment:</p><p>The impacts of 1st amendments are following.</p><p>(1)  It made a way or primary initiation in or dear to prosecute the prisoners who were liable for genocide, crime against humanity and war crimes comminuted in the liberation war of 1971.</p><p>(2)  The issue was negotiated according to the international law.</p><p>But unfortunately it did not give the successful fruit because of the lack of adequate and strong steps.</p><p>Impact of 2nd amendment:</p><p>The impacts of 2nd amendment are given below:</p><p>(i)   It provided the provision for the suspension of the inalienable rights i.e. fundamental rights of the citizens.</p><p>It has attacked the inalienability of human being’s rights. The word ‘inalienability’ denotes that you can not separate the inherent rights of the human being. Suspension connotes the separation of inalienable rights.</p><p>(ii)  For the enactment of the provision of preventive detention, the state has got a type of additional power to arrest the citizens. By this power the state authority can arrest and continue torture upon any citizen. In our society we have seen some untold and bad precedent regarding preventive detention.</p><p>Impact of 3rd amendment:</p><p>This amendment had changed the geographical position and boundary line between India and Bangladesh. It solved the geo-problem of the both countries.</p><p>Impact of 4th amendment:</p><p>(i)   The parliamentary form of government was changed and  one party dictatorial system was introduced.</p><p>(ii)  It centralized all the powers of the state in the hand of one party i.e. one man Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p><p>(iii) The different top leaders of BAKSAL except Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman abused that centralized power, they thought that they are absolute power holder.</p><p>(iv) This amendment empowered than and them violated any law in satisfying their interest.</p><p>Impact of 5th amendment:</p><p>(i)   This legalized and led the Military person to lake the power of the State.</p><p>(ii)  For this amendment, Military person who is not an elected representative ruled the country according to his own law.’ It suspended the constitutional sprit for the democracy.</p><p>(iii) But this amendment restored some democratic Provisions in comparing with the 4th amendment.</p><p>Impact of sixth amendment:</p><p>(i)   This amendment enabled Sattar to contest the election without resignation from his office.</p><p>(ii)  This was done and accepted for the well purpose but not for the so-called political reason.</p><p>Impact of seventh amendment:</p><p>(i)   The coup of march 24, 1982 was legalized and the then President Hussain Muhammad Ershad got a system with all powerful dictatorial executive and a rubber stamp parliament, which in no way hampered rather it helped to the continuation of controlled democracy.</p><p>(ii)  By this amendment, the age of the Supreme Court Judges was increased and in practical he helped to continue the Martial Law.</p><p>Impact of 8th amendment:</p><p>(i)   To make Islam, as the State religion made the people to believe Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Most of people of our country are religious and that is why they were happy for giving the status of Islam as State religion.</p><p>(ii)  To make the provision for setting up six permanent Benches of the High Court Division outside Dhaka affected. Dhaka based lawyers and Judges of the Supreme Court. They were not willing to move outside Dhaka because of their family member’s Dhaka based opportunity.</p><p>Impact of 9th amendment:</p><p>This amendment, at that time sought to democratize the executive. But after the 12th amendment It has got effectiveness.</p><p>Impact of 10th amendment:</p><p>This amendment has helped some women of the elite or ruling citizens to be more rich. The ordinary women did not, don’t and probably will not be the members of Parliament. So the intention for enacting the provision of 30 women reserved seats is not for the welfare of the village women or the real backward women.</p><p>There was and is no statistics of backward women and the programme for decreasing or eliminating their backwardness.</p><p>They did not and do not discuss and have any reasonable step by which the degree of backwardness will be eliminated. They have no time based framework. After 33years of our independence, they did not do anything really for the advancement of the real backward women of the country. What has been improved by this amendment? In answering of this question, It can be told that some women who are the relative or the party based women have advanced their own lot only.</p><p>In fact, the reserved women members are called the ornament of the parliament. Here it can be quoted the statement of Golam Muhammad Quader MP. According to him the reserved women members are only the ornament of the Parliament because they have no role at the time of making any law without giving yes or no.1</p><p>Impact of 11th amendment:</p><p>This amendment made a precedent of giving retrospective effect of law, By this amendment the activities of Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed and his return to his previous position of the chief Justice of Bangladesh were legalised. This widened the flexibility of the constitution.</p><p>Impact 12th amendment:</p><p>This amendment again established the parliamentary form of government. The people of our country thought that, this form of government will rule the country very correctly. But the hope of the people has been of destroyed. The purpose parliamentary form of govt. has been failed because of other lacunas of our constitution particularly art. 70 and the centralization of all powers in the hand of execution.</p><p>Impact of 13th amendments:</p><p>Article 58C(3) provides that the President shall appoint as chief Adviser the person who among the retired Chief Justices of Bangladesh retired last…”</p><p>Here, the most important thinking word is “last”. By the word ‘last’ it has specified that the last retired. Justice would be appointed as the chief Adviser. For this opportunity the party in power can try to systemize the favorable will judge who will be the chief Adviser. This opportunity leads a party in power to violate the seniority matter.</p><p>As for example we can say the name of Justice K.M. Hasan who had been appointed by the present government in getting favoritism in the National Election. This specific way of becoming the Chief Adviser’ should be abolished in order to hold free, fair and neutral election.</p><p>Chap. 3.1:</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>In getting free fair and neutral election the following recommendations can be considered:-</p><p>(i)   Chief Adviser would be appointed from the retired and capable Chief Justices of Bangladesh by means of lottery. The lottery will be opened.</p><p>Provided that, the capable Chief Justices will not be directly or in directly involved in the party politics.</p><p>(ii)  Each party containing member members in the parliament will propose not more than the name of 2 capable retired Chief Justices of Bangladesh. All proposed retired Chief Justices will casts their two votes in favour of two of them.</p><p>In an open meeting it will be done No Justice will cast his vote in favour of himself. The president as the Chief Adviser will appoint the Chief Justice of Bangladesh who will get the majority vote among them.</p><p>In the same way, other ten members of Non-Party Care-Taker Government will be appointed.

9215	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The Constitution of Bangladesh does not directly state the indigenous peoples</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Constitution of Bangladesh does not directly state the indigenous peoples, but it is understood that the indigenous peoples is the part of the disadvantaged community-illustrate and explain.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There have been about forty five Indigenous communities in the country of Bangladesh living for centuries. There are about two million indigenous peoples living in Bangladesh. According to 1991 survey, the number of indigenous people was Chittagong hill tracks is about 501,144 and the number of indigenous peoples of the plain regions was estimated about 704,834. But the Indigenous peoples argue that the number of indigenous people in the country is now about three million. The biggest number of indigenous peoples is found in the southeastern border region of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (Chittagong hill tracks). There is no legal acknowledgment of indigenous peoples in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh refers indigenous peoples as ‘tribal’ in official documents. Some official documents also sometimes refer to them as ‘aboriginals’ and ‘indigenous hill men’. The Constitution of Bangladesh does not directly state the indigenous peoples, but it is understood that the indigenous peoples is the part of the disadvantaged community, which the constitution terms as ‘backward section of citizens’. But the reference to “backward segments of the population” is without identifying as to who are these “backward segments of the population”. The Constitution of Bangladesh ensures impartiality before the law for all its citizens. It unconditionally states that “the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth” (Articles 27 &amp; 28)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>. But, the government has been unsuccessful to make any improvement for political, social and economic development of indigenous peoples. This failure to provide specific constitutional safeguards has made indigenous peoples really helpless. There is no rule of law. The law enforcement personnel are prejudiced. In Bangladesh, indigenous peoples do not represent in the Parliament, Upazila Parishad and in the Union Parishad (local representative body). The government regardless of the political party is grabbing their land. This policy of land acquiring for any public or private purpose is threatening the identity and continued existence of indigenous peoples.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Human rights of indigenous peoples under constitution</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Internationally, the Bangladesh has been strongly criticized for its human rights violations, mainly in the indigenous areas. The government of Bangladesh has no official and comprehensive policy with regard to the indigenous peoples of the country. The most severe problems faced by indigenous people in Bangladesh include the limited access to education and other social services, biasness by the non-indigenous people. The in general human rights condition of the indigenous peoples of Bangladesh is far from good. Compared to indigenous people in the plains regions, indigenous people in the Chittagong hill tracks are in a comparatively better position because of the existence of the semi autonomous administrative system Hill District Councils and Regional Council. Of course, unlike Chittagong hill tracks, militarization and massive trans-migration of Bengalis are not affecting the indigenous peoples of the plains.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.1. Implementation of international treaties</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh has complied most of the international human rights treaties including the ILO Convention 107. This ensures indigenous peoples certain rights such as the right to land, self governance and development. In addition, it has authorized the Economic and Social Council Resolution 2000/22. This establishes the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues with the authorization to advise and suggest to the Economic and Social Council on six subjects: (1) Economic and Social Development, (2) Human Rights, (3) Culture, (4) Education, (5) Health and (6) Environment. So, Bangladesh is legally liable to comply with these international human rights treaties. But it does not comply with them so far. The UN Monitoring Committee on studied the Bangladesh country report in 2004 and The Committee called upon Bangladesh to include without delay the provisions of the Convention into its domestic law and requested Bangladesh to make sure that the provisions of the Convention be fully imitated in the Constitution and all legislations<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. Many of the provisions of Bangladeshi law match to the standards of Convention No. 107 but several fail of these standards. Human rights activists stated that the situation of implementation of the provisions of the abovementioned treaties is far from good. In particular, various vital provisions of the ILO Convention No. 107 are of particular concern since it is the only human rights treaty with significance to indigenous peoples in Bangladesh. Another international treaty approved by Bangladesh and related to its indigenous peoples is the Convention on Biological Diversity. This contains provisions on the protection of the traditional knowledge systems and genetic resources of indigenous communities and actions for their fair utilization. Unfortunately, most of the abovementioned provisions remain unimplemented, especially in the plains regions. There are several factors behind the weak execution of the aforesaid treaty provisions in Bangladesh. First, under Bangladeshi law, international rights are not directly enforceable in the courts of law. Secondly, the treaty supervising system is complex, and provides no direct access to indigenous peoples.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.2. Special legislation for indigenous peoples</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution of Bangladesh affirms that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, religion and place of birth. The Constitution states that nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making special provision in favor of women or children or for the progression of any backward section of citizens. Though the Constitution of Bangladesh does not directly mention the indigenous peoples<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, it is understood that the indigenous peoples form part of the underprivileged part of the citizens, which the constitution expressed ‘backward section of citizens’. It is widely well-known that indigenous peoples do not enjoy equal treatment before the law and administration. The Constitution affirms that nothing in this article shall prevent the State from: (a) making special provision in favor of any backward section of citizens for the purpose of securing their adequate representation in the service of the Republic; (b) giving effect to any law which makes provision for reserving appointments relating to any religious or denominational institution to persons of that religion or denomination; (c) reserving for members of one sex any class of employment or office on the ground that it is considered by its nature to be unsuited to members of the opposite sex. This provision provides the scope for positive action for indigenous peoples in the name of the ‘backward section of citizens’. Under these provisions of the constitution, the government undertakes some affirmative action in favor of indigenous peoples. Notable among these are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Setting up of a Special Affairs Division under the Prime Minister’s Office particularly for plains land indigenous people.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Signing of the Chittagong hill tracks Peace Accord with the PCJSS as a solution of the Chittagong hill track problem through political and peaceful means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Enactment of the Chittagong hill tracks Land Dispute Resolution Commission Act of 2001.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Amendment of Chittagong hill tracks Regulation in 2003 for establishment of a separate district judge court in Chittagong hill tracks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Insertion of the term ‘adivasi’ and indigenous peoples’ issues in the Poverty Reduction</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strategy Paper (PRSP);</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Continuing of quota reservation in the government jobs and educational institutions for ‘tribal’ people, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Chittagong hill tracks have a far larger body of laws that refers directly to indigenous people. Some of these laws recognize indigenous peoples’ customs regarding the ownership and use of lands and other natural resources.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.3. National policies for indigenous peoples</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Government policy may also be implicit from the national sectional policies and programs of the government. With regard to other national policies, e.g., healthcare, education, employment, land administration there are no special aim to address the problems faced by indigenous communities, especially those living in remote areas. These problems cannot be determined through the usual programs that were intended with the populated regions in mind. Therefore, in order to provide equal right to use to indigenous peoples to healthcare, education, training, employment, etc. as promised in the national constitution the national policies needs to provide special actions. Without these there will be no equal state services for these disadvantaged people. With regard to employment, there are reserved seats for certain jobs and seats in educational institutions for indigenous people. The indigenous rights activists expressed their grief that the Act has been arbitrarily used against different minority ethnic group including indigenous peoples in the north-western region and in north-central region of the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Status of indigenous women and children</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Indigenous women and children in Bangladesh are particularly facing serious violations including killing and rape by the mainstream peoples. Rape is being used as a weapon to threaten and disgrace the indigenous peoples. Many women and minor girls have been killed after rape. In case of healthcare and education programs, tens of thousands of indigenous people continue to be deprived of healthcare and education facilities<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. In the case of education policy, there is no provision for indigenous children to be commenced to mother tongue education at the primary level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. 15<sup>th</sup> Amendment of the Constitution and changes in the status of Indigenous people</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On June 30, 2011, parliament passed the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Bill, 2011, and included a few provisions that are directly relevant for indigenous people. Parliament and the cabinet and the Ministry of Law accepted the draft presented by the special committee on constitutional reforms. On June 30, 2011 after the acceptance of the bill, it was rejected by several groups of citizens. Eleven left-leaning parties and the Chittagong hill tracks-based party, JSS held a protest demonstration in Dhaka city. The 15th amendment to the constitution makes every citizen of Bangladesh a ‘ Bangali ‘. Among others, in a new article on the protection of the culture and heritage of indigenous people referred the indigenous people as ‘upa-jati’ (similar to tribe), ‘khudro nrigoshthi’ (small ethnic group), ‘khudro-jatishotta’ (small nation/people) and ‘khudro-shomprodai’ (small community). The indigenous people find these terms reproachful, disrespectful and unacceptable. Several indigenous people from the Chittagong hill tracks and other parts of Bangladesh stated that the opportunity to bring forth adequate recognition is being lost for now, and for several decades to come.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Reaction of the indigenous people to 15<sup>th</sup> Amendments of the constitution</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) rejected the Constitution (15th Amendment) Bill, 2011 and stated that through the means of the bill different indigenous groups are identified as Bangali in the constitution. So their tribal identities and basic rights have been denied. So the government should be responsible for any horrible situation due to the undemocratic and oppressive steps towards the indigenous people. Leaders of anti-peace accord United People’s Democratic Front (UPDF)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> brought out a procession criticizing the government for terming the indigenous people as Bangali. They said an indigenous man or woman cannot be a Bangali. Bangali is also applicable for a Bangla speaking person. Chief of Chakma circle barrister Raja Debashish Roy at the conference said “The same mistake was made in 1972 and the indigenous people will never accept it.” On 17 August 2011 in two separate demonstrations held in Rajshahi and Gazipur, leaders of indigenous peoples and rights activists of mainstream population demanded the government evaluation the 15th amendment to the constitution, which did not identify them as ‘indigenous peoples’. The ruling party Awami League in its election manifesto had promised to ensure the rights of indigenous peoples to land, water bodies and forests revoking all discriminatory laws. But this has completely changed in 2011. Now the government says that there are no indigenous people in the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6. Conclusion</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The indigenous peoples of Bangladesh are underprivileged as a result of the lack of respect for their culture, customs and traditions. They do not have the right and access to self-determination, control over their own land and territories and now even their own identities. They lack full and effective participation in their development and involvement in the decision-making. Their century old systems are at the edge of extinction. So the government should repeal the 15<sup>th</sup> amendment of the constitution and provide the adequate rights and identities to the indigenous people.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adnan, Shapan.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Discuss the principle of judicial review in the light of Marbury vs. Madison case. Do you think that the Constitution of Bangladesh expressly recognized the principles of judicial review? Discuss.</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1) Introduction:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial review means the higher level court review cases that involve laws and analyze. If those laws are in conflict with any other higher forms of law, court invalid those laws, such as constitution. It is a very important segment of the check and balance to give limitations to the authority of the legislative branch. Judicial review is important because it pays as a check on the other branches of Government. Judicial review is the power of the court to review the laws, policies, treaties or other executive orders which is relevant to cases and court found those unconstitutional.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial review is a standard part of <b>British Common Law</b> but now become a legal process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial review was first established in the case of Marbury VS Madison. This is the landmark of constitutional laws. In this case, Justice Maeshall held that the high court have the power to declare invalid acts of congress and executive actions that run afoul of the constitution. The main issue in this case was, whether the incoming President Thomas Jefferson had the power to withdraw William Marbury’s “midnight appointment”. In that case Chief Justice Marshall declared section 13 of the Judiciary act of 1789 unconstitutional. This was the first time the Supreme Court overturn federal legislation. It makes the power of judicial branch stronger</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This Judicial Review is the support of any constitution to establish peace in the society. In this report the principals of Marbury vs. Madison case and the recognition in our constitution will be discussed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2) Judicial Review:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial Review is one of the main characteristics of any democratic government. It can be defined by two different but parallel legal systems-</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Civil law</li><li>Common Law</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">These two legal systems carried out two different theories and views about judicial review. Common law judges are seen as a source of law who are capable to create new laws and regulations and also have the power to reject those laws which are not important or not need to implement. They can vanish or stop those laws. And in the Civil law judges are seen as the implementer of laws. Means they can only apply those laws which are in the system but cannot create new laws of cannot reject any law. They don’t have that power.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The idea of separation of power is another aspect of how a democratic government should organized. In the term of legislative supremacy, the idea of separation of power was first introduced in France but later it was institution zed by the supreme court in the united states in the Marbury vs. Madison case.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial review gives ideas to government how to set up a proper legal system in the country to keep peace and democracy. Today most of the courts allow reviewing the judicial systems. Generally judicial review carried out in the regular court but sometimes panel also created if needed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a) Why Judicial Review is important: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial Review is important mainly because, without the judicial review, any constitution is like a piece of paper. Without this constitution would be nothing but some written documents only. The Constitution states that it is the supreme law of the country. to maintain the democracy and sovereignty, there has to be an authority to decide whether a particular law is constitutional or un constitutional, whether any law is needed by the country or not. If not, then the legislative branch is free to pass any law which is constitutional and also can stop any law which is not necessary. They are the responsible to maintain the constitutionality. judicial authority always has the power to interpreted laws, Constitution give judicial branch power to all over the cases under the constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3) Marbury VS. Madison :</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Marbury case happened in the era when USA was still decontamination the balace of power between the three branches of the government and trying to resolve the differences. In Marbury vs. Madison, (1803) the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the constitution gave the power to the authority of judicial review.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a) Background :</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Marbury vs Madison case is a landmark case in the United States law and in the history of law worldwide. It was formed in the base of the exercise of judicial review in the united stated under <b>Article III</b> of the constitution. It was also the first time in western history that a court invalidated a law by declaring it unconstitutional. The landmark decision helped to define the boundary between the constitutionally separate executive and judicial branches of the government.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The case resulted from a petition to the Supreme Court by William Marbury who had been appointed by the president as the <b>Justice of the peace </b>but whose commission was not subsequently delivered. Marbury made petitioned the Supreme Court to force the new secretary James Madison to deliver the documents. The court with Marshall, the chief justice, found that Madison’s refusal to deliver the commission was both illegal and remediable. The court stopped short of compelling Madison to handover Marbury’s commission, instead of holding the provision of the <b>judiciary act of 1789</b> which enabled Marbury to bring his claim to the Supreme Court was itself unconstitutional. Since this purported to extend the court’s original jurisdiction beyond that which article iii established. The petition was therefore denied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4) Principles if the case</b>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The relevant parts are discussed here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first such principle is the “Original Rights” of people to establish a constitution for future. People have the right to establish their opinion and wishes for future. The exercise of this original right is a very great exertion. And as the authority which they precede is supreme and can seldom act they are designed to be permanent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a) </b>Next principle says that the power of each government are intended to be limited and delineated by the constitution and not assumed to be absolute or plenary. Here the power of legislation is defined and limited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b) </b>Justice Marshall plainly articulates the absurdity of allowing legislatures to over ride the constitution. Marshall considered the super legal character of a constitution to be especially evident when it is writer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>c) </b>In those cases where court finds a law to be in contradiction with the constitution, the constitution rather than the ordinary law must be applied to the case. Here the court’s function is to decide what law to apply to a particular case, not to act as a super legislature over ruling laws.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>d) </b>The court is obligated to act constitutionally within its own jurisdiction. So it must not apply unconstitutional laws in its decision , just as the executive ought not to enforce a law which court find un constitutional.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>e) </b>It is declared that’ no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state’. The constitution declares that ‘no bill of attainder or ex post law shall be passed’.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus the main terminology is to determine the constitution of an act of government. These judicial systems will support a government to make democracy and to keep peace in the society.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5) Judicial Review in the Constitution of Bangladesh:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A constitution is meant to be permanent, but as all changing situations cannot be envisaged and amendment of the constitution may be necessary to adapt to the future developments. Part VI of the constitution deals with judiciary. In our constitution art 7 provides that all power in the republic shall be affected only under and by the authority of the constitution. The responsibility of seeing that no functionary of the state oversteps the limit of the power, of necessity, on the judiciary.&lt;href=”#_ftn1″ name=”_ftnref1″ title=””&gt;[1]. The constitution vests the executive power of the Republic in the prime minister and the legislative power of the republic in the parliament. The constitution may omit any express provision conferring judicial power on the judiciary; even then the judicial power is exercisable by the judiciary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The majority in Bangladesh v. A.K.M Jahangir held that any tribunal which is not invested with some part of the judicial power of the republic is outside the ambit of art 102(5). Art 102(5) refers to the administrative tribunals exercise the judicial power of the republic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Art 94 provides for the supreme court of Bangladesh comprising two divisions-</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>The Appellate Division</li><li>The High Court</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>6) Principles in Judicial Review of law: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ours is a controlled constitution with entrenched provision which has circumscribed the power of parliament in making laws and has reposed on the Supreme Court the Constitutional responsibility to adjudicate upon the validity of laws. In defense to the co- equal status of the legislature, follows certain principles in keeping with the necessity of harmonious working of the different organs of the state. These principles are stated below-</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a) </b> <b>The Supreme Court : </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When the constitutionality of a law is challenged, the curt is to begin with a presumption of constitutionality of the law and the person challenging the validity of the law must show that the law is clearly unconstitutional.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b) A unitary, Independent, Sovereign Republic: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The constitution expresses itself on one of its basic structure in Article 1, “Bangladesh is a unitary, independent and sovereign Republic to be known as the People’s Republic of Bangladesh “.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>c) Separation of Power: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The constitution assigned to the legislature, executive and the judiciary clearly demarcated roles, each controlled by constitutional provisions and no one organ generally overlapping with the other.. Article 55(2) had undergone some changes but it was restored in full by the Constitution. But there is no express vesting of judicial review in the Supreme Court in the Constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>d) Supremacy of the Constitution: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The doctrine in the United Kingdom is not available in a written Constitution which contains a constitutional system of restrains giving the superior court a power of judicial review. A written constitution is a mandate for limited government, each organ of the state limited and controlled by the jurisdiction conferred on it by the constitution and thereby obliged to act within the limitations imposed by the constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>e) Constitutional Limitations:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The constitution itself places limitations on the power of parliament to make ordinary laws. Article 65 vests parliament with ‘the legislative powers of the Republic’ but the vesting is ‘subject to the provisions of this Constitution’.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>f) Limitations on the power of amendment of the constitution:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In amending the constitution parliament passes a law. The Appellate Division by a majority judgment answers the question in the negative. Relying on the preamble and article 7 of the constitution it declares the 8<sup>th</sup> amendment of the constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>g) Independence of the Judiciary :</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“The constitution in its original form devised a scheme of completely independent judiciary. The independence of the judiciary can be measured by the provision a constitution contains in the matter of selection and appointment of judges, security of tenure, remuneration and other privileges, irrmoveability except on proved misconduct, independence in the exercise of judicial function the assurance of compliance with the judge’s decision and the substance of power and jurisdiction that it confers upon the judiciary”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>h) Independence in the exercise of judicial function:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 94(4) of the constitution provides, “subject to the provisions of this constitution the Chief Justice and the other Judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>7) Power of Judicial Review:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The remedy of judicial review is different from the remedy of appeal; the appellate authority goes into the merit of the case either on a point of law or on points both of law and facts&lt;href=”#_ftn2″ name=”_ftnref2″ title=””&gt;[2]. In judicial review the court is concerned with the question whether the act under review is lawful or unlawful. Courts exercise the power of judicial review on the basis of powers that can be validly exercised only within their true limits and a public functionary is not to be allowed to disobey the limits f the authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In our country s.9 of the code of civil procedure permits the civil court to try all suits of civil nature unless expressly or by <b>necessary implications. </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>8) Judicial Activism in Bangladesh:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“The judges apply the law to facts in and describe about the term “Judicial restraint” and: Judicial activism”. The difference is that, ‘the judges take the law as it is and activist judges make up the law as they go along’. In Bangladesh judicial activisms does not find any configuration. It is not defined anywhere but is extensively talked about it in all section of the society, NGOs and bureaucrats. Statement of judiciary and its power is judicial activism. Many people label it is over active judiciary. In the south Asia, ‘the judiciary of India has created standard precedents of judicial activism for defending human rights, human distinction and establishing good governance’.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>9) The importance of Judicial Review in Bangladesh :</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a) Opportunity for the public to participate:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judicial review creates a right for individual to approach the court for relief over a breach of an act. It makes it possible to challenge a determination of the consent authority. Judicial review of environmental matters therefore allows the public an opportunity to participate in the environment planning and development process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b) Opportunities available for relief:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladesh there is currently no environmental legislation which gives the opportunity to a [person to bring proceedings for remedy or restrain the breach of an act. Notwithstanding, a person may seek judicial review under the civil procedure code 1908 or criminal procedure code 1898, though there has been little reference made to the opportunities available for relief under these cods</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10) <b>Conclusion:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Good governance depends on harmonious functioning of the three organ of a state. Our past experience showed that at least the executive organ was largely responsible for upsetting the balance with the higher judiciary and the parliament remaining as silent spectators. Executive organ is largely responsible for upsetting the balance with the higher judiciary and the parliament remaining as silent spectators. Above discussion clearly shows that the present condition of the judiciary is not satisfactory. However, the independent and particular policy for judiciary is a must to overcome the situation, after all government must be committed to ensure the rule of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In an act a provision may be made that rules and regulations, by laws etc made under it, ‘shall have effect as if enacted in the act’, in Bangladesh this question cannot arise that whether the provision exclude court’s power of judicial review, Because under the court constitution (article 102) doctrine of judicial review is accepted and treated as basic structure and essential features of the constitution. It cannot be taken by a statutory provision or even by a constitutional amendment</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BIBLIOGRAPHY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1) Charles Arnold Baker, the companion of British History, English law, London:Loncross denholm Press, 2008,p 484</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2) Massey.I.P.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The constitution of Bangladesh has already accorded preferential treatment to the backward sections of the people which also include indigenous people or ethnic minority</b>.-Discuss</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“<i>Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them</i>. <i>They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system</i>”. On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group. In Bangladesh people prefer to call tribal people rather than indigenous people. Bangladesh’s tribal population consists of about 1 million people, just less than 1 percent of the total population. They live primarily in the Chittagong Hills and in the regions of Mymensingh, Sylhet, and Rajshahi. The majority of the tribal population lives in rural settings, where many practice shifting cultivation. Most tribal people are of SinoTibetan descent and have distinctive Mongoloid features. They differ in their social organization, marriage customs, birth and death rites, food, and other social customs from the people of the rest of the country. They speak Tibeto-Burman languages. In the mid-1980s, the percentage distribution of tribal population by religion was Hindu 24, Buddhist 44, Christian 13, and others 19. The four largest tribes are the Chakmas, Marmas (or Maghs), Tipperas (or Tipras), and Mros (or Moorangs). Many indigenous communities have been living in the country for centuries in Bangladesh. The constitution of Bangladesh has already accorded preferential treatment to the backward sections of the people which also include indigenous people or ethnic minority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> I. The Indigenous People of Bangladesh</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The issue of the identity of the indigenous peoples of Bangladesh has led to much debate and controversy, and on occasions has brought indigenous leaders and government officials into sharp disagreement. The aboriginal groups in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) are generally known as ‘Pahari’ (meaning hillpeople), or as Jumma (from the common tradition of swidden or ‘jum’ cultivation). The plains aboriginals, particularly those in the north-western greater Rajshahi region, used to be generally known as <i>Adivasi</i>, meaning aboriginal or indigenous. However, ever since 1992, when the <i>International Year of the Indigenous Peoples </i>was declared by the United Nations, more and more indigenous peoples, both from theCHT and the plains, have started to increasingly refer to themselves as <i>indigenous </i>in English, and as <i>Adivasi </i>inthe national language, Bengali. Government perspectives on the issue, however, are varied. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example, has at times preferred the terms ‘tribe’ and ‘tribal’ (“upajati in Bengali) to ‘indigenous’ and ‘adivasi’. Non-indigenous functionaries at the district and sub-district levels too were generally seen to prefer the terms “tribe and “tribal;” ortheir Bengali equivalent, ‘upajati’, but the term Adivasi is being used more widely, especially in the plains districts. The legal situation, on the other hand, is quite pluralistic, and reflects, in its totality, the currency of all the termspreferred by government officials and indigenous peoples combined. Recent legislation seems to favor the terms“tribe/tribal”. A 1995 law – primarily a finance law, but also containing specific references to the exemption ofincome tax payments by indigenous people in the CHT – uses the term “indigenous hill men”. In the National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper adopted by the Government of Bangladesh in 2005 (“PRSP-I”), the term “Adivasi/ethnic minorities” was used. In the PRSP-II, adopted in October 2008, the terms “indigenous communities” and “indigenous people” were both used.In a proposed amendment to the Union Councils Ordinance, 2008, a provision was sought to be introduced to maintain reserved seats for <i>Adivasis </i>in union councils (“union “parishads”) in areas outside the CHT where there was a significant Adivasi population. Regards the terminology used, the private press and media too display divergent attitudes, but on the whole, most tend nowadays to be respectful towards the views of the peoples concerned, and ‘indigenous’ and ‘adivasi’ are generally preferred over ‘tribes’ or ‘tribal’. Similarly, more and more prominent figures of Bangladeshi civil society are being seen to use the terms indigenous or Adivasi. For example, a political party leader and now Member of Parliament and government minister, recently wrote; “The diversity of our culture due to the presence of indigenous communities is providing extra vigor to the national fabric of Bangladesh. Moreover, indigenous people are the original inhabitants of our country. So, they have the same right we have over Bangladesh, if not more.” This is also consistent with current discourses in the progressive development of human rights law, including the <i>UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> II. The Constitution &amp; indigenous people</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After the independence of Bangladesh, the ruling government overlooks the rights of the indigenous people when national constitution adopted and suppressed their quest for identity and autonomy. The 1972 constitution of Bangladesh does not include any provision for recognizing the distinct identity of the indigenous people or accord the hill tract any special status, despite their lot of effort. And today’s constitution also says that the people of the hills are not indigenous people. As constitution of Bangladesh applies everywhere, Bengalis have equal rights to lands in the hills. The people of the hills are also citizens of Bangladesh (not indigenous) – that is also reminded in the constitution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">III. <b>Recent constitutional provision and Demands for Constitutional Recognition:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">At 29 August 2005 High Court verdict that declared the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1979 (Act 1 of 1979) ultra vires and illegal, the government of Bangladesh took initiative to amend the constitution. To pursue the government of Bangladesh for constitutional recognition of indigenous peoples, the leaders of indigenous peoples raised their voices for recognition of their rights to existence, identities, culture, participation and consent, self-government, land and territories in the constitution. It is mentionable that as per verdict of Supreme Court, Awami League-led present grand alliance government amended constitution of Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For this purpose, Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament) passed Fifteen Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2011 on 30 June 2011.Then the government did not provide constitutional recognition of indigenous peoples as indigenous peoples (Adibasi); rather, termed tribals, small nationalities, ethnic group and communities. These terminologies are not accepted by the indigenous peoples. Fifteen Amendment provides that the People of Bangladesh shall be known as Bengali as a nation and the citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bangladeshis. Indigenous peoples of Bangladesh do not want to be known as Bengali. Indigenous peoples rejected it saying that they are Bangladeshi as citizens, but they are not “Bengali” as nation/community. They (indigenous peoples) all are a separate nation possessing separate identity, culture, customs, language and society. Indigenous peoples also protested against retaining of “BISMILLAH-AR-RAHMAN-AR-RAHIM” (In the name of Allah) in the preamble of the constitution and ISLAM as state religion. They argued that Islam alone cannot be the state religion as there are people who practice and follow other religions such as Hindu, Christian, Bouddha and Indigenous Practices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Conclusion</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh government is thinking to give them constitutional recognition for the betterment of indigenous people. If Bangladeshi government gives them constitutional recognition then the long cherished demand of indigenous people will be fulfilled. So it will ensure greater opportunities and wider participation of indigenous people in national activities that we can take this country forward. In recent years, fairly good number of people from these communities has made an entry into such professions as the armed forces, civil service and elsewhere. Yet there needs to be more emphasis on such advances being made. There are the relatively backward indigenous groups, such as the Garos, Khassias and Santals, who are in need of affirmative action in order to be recent years, efforts made by academics and social groups to bring indigenous problems into focus through rallies, publication of books and research have greatly sensitized people to indigenous issues. But these efforts need to be made more substantive through a continuous process of integrating indigenous people into national developmental activity and thus mainstreaming them in the economy. Care must be exercised, though, to ensure that their distinctive heritage is not only maintained but also promoted –because the customers and mores of these communities’ add color, content and diversity to our national culture.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BIBLIOGRAPHY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladeshi constitution.(n.d).

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The constitution of Bangladesh is drafted in such a way that ensures the development of women in all spheres of life – Explain and illustrate.</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam wrote- the good done by civilization, half created by men and rest by women. This is an undying statement about the progress of human civilization. From the dawn of the civilization women and men worked jointly to make the future brighter. In a certain point of the social development process a few socially determined factors created a cultural hemisphere, which pushed the civilization not to think women as equal to the men. This cultural phenomenon changed the thought process of society and the society started discrimination between men and women and ultimately women become a deprived part of society. The overall development of a country depends upon the maximum utilization of her people, both men and women. In Bangladesh women comprise nearly half of the total population. But the status of women is much lower than that of men in every sphere of life.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh, a participant to the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and Beijing Platform for Action (BPFA) has been committed for attaining the objectives of ensuring gender equality and empowerment of women. Bangladesh government has been actively engaged in formulating proactive policies and taking affirmative action’s for accelerating the implementation process in achieving the goal of holistic empowerment of women.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the last two decades the initiative to ensure equal rights for women and non discrimination has gained momentum in Bangladesh and has been successful in mobilizing and coordinating women to stand up for their rights. However, relentless endeavor is underway on the part of the government by way of adoption of policies, legislation, strategies, national action plans and program for realization of empowerment of women. The pro-women policies, strategies and measures of the government undertaken in the last decades have positively influenced the reduction of poverty of women. A number of programs were undertaken by government that includes safety net, development activities, etc. The NGOs have micro credit programs for production and business by women. Private sector generated employment for women especially in garments sectors. All these have contributed to grater poverty reduction for women. Progress of women can be traced from their increasing economic participation through employment in various sectors including garments, shoes and cosmetics industries in formal sector and also self-employment in non formal activities. Women also work in agricultural sector; women are employed in crop production, in livestock, in forestry, in fishery. There is a growing trend of women working in construction sites. Positive indicators of women’s advancement in the country are reflected in continuing gender parity in school enrolment, gradually lower infant mortality and decrease in maternal mortality rates. There has been significant progress in health and education areas. The improved health services through implementation of Health, Nutrition and Population related programs have contributed to improve health especially of women. Nutrition situation has also improved. The proportion of non-pregnant mother in the chronic energy deficiency situation decline from 44.2 percent in 2006 to 32.2 percent in 2005. Maternal mortality decreased to 3037 per 100live birth in 2006 from 3.65 in 2004.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The CEDAW Committee mention on the Fifth Periodic Report of Bangladesh congratulated the government for achieving gender parity and dramatic increase in the enrolment of girls in primary and lower secondary level in schools. This was possible by the innovative steps taken by the government of making substantial investment in both primary and secondary education of girls by giving scholarships, stipends and introducing free education. The committee praised the initiative of the government in reaching out to rural poor women in providing maternal health care services through community and mobile clinic which resulted in decreased of maternal mortality rate. The committee concluded by observing that Bangladesh was marching ahead with the correct mindset and progress on all socioeconomic fronts including women’s empowerment was clear.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A new era of democracy has ushered in Bangladesh with the parliamentary election in December 2008. The newly elected government has declared ‘Vision 2021”. Bangladesh government is committed in mainstreaming gender issues in order to incorporate them within the framework of macroeconomics and formulation of policies to effective, substantial and visible changes to the lives of women at all level and in all spheres.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Constitutional Structure</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, 1972 is the serious expression of the will of the people and the supreme law of the land. If any other law in inconsistent with the Constitution that other law shall to the extent of such inconstancy be void. Part-II of the Constitution contains the Fundamental Principles of state policy, fundamental to the governance of Bangladesh to be applied by the state in the making of laws and serve as guide to interpretation of the constitution and of other laws.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Part-III contains Fundamental Rights i.e. fright to equality before law, right to life, right to equal protection of law etc. Article 28(1) provides that state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of sex. Article 28(2) specifically provides that “Women shall have equal right with men in al spheres of the state and public life”. Article 7 is the Pole Star of the Constitution stating that all powers in the Republic belong to the people.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Political Structure:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh has parliamentary form of government headed by Prime Minister. Parliament consists of 300 members who are directly elected and 45 women members from reserved seats as enshrined in the Constitution, constituting a total of 345 members of Parliament. It may be mentioned that 19 members are women who have been directly elected which makes the number of women Parliamentarians 64 (45+19). The local government representatives are responsible for local level development. The country is administratively divided into 6 divisions consisting of 64 districts, 467 Upazilas (sub-districts) and 4.480 Union Parishads. The lowest unit of local Government is the Union Parishad run by the elected representatives. Districts are the main administrative units. The civil servants carry out the executive responsibilities of these administrative units.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The women can directly participate in all elections at the national level and local level government. As, equity measure, the constitution of Bangladesh contains provision for quota of women in the national and local government representations. The reserved seats for women in the parliament were increased from 30 to 45 in 2006 and they are elected by the parliament members of the general seats. In 1997, one third of the local government seats of members or councilors were reserved for women who would be elected by the direct vote of the people. This has become a milestone for women’s participation in the political empowerment process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the second tire of the local elected bodies, Upzilla Parishads, one of the tows elected Vice Chairman has to be a woman. Accordingly, 475 women have been elected as Vice Chairman out of 1,936 women who contested during elections held in January 2009.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The newly elected government in January 2009 led by a woman prime minister has appointed five women to the cabinet (three as full ministers and two as state ministers) responsible for key portfolios such as agriculture, home affairs, foreign affairs, women and children affairs, and labor and employment. The leader of the opposition in the parliament is also a woman (former prime minister). For the first time, a woman has been appointed as the deputy leader of the house in parliament and a women MP has been appointed as the chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Women and Children Affairs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An increasing number of women voters have participated in the successive elections with 50.87 percent in 2008 as compared to 48.2 percent in 2001. As per local government (City Corporation) ordinance 2008, under section 5, sub-section (2), in each City Corporation, one third of the total number of councilor’s posts is reserved for women. As per local government (Pourashava/District Head Quarters) ordinance 2008, under section 7, sub-section (1), in each Pourashava, one third of the total number of councilor’s posts is reserved for women.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Empowerment and Development of women</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Economic empowerment of women is a high priority agenda of the government. Abolition of poverty being the focal point, Government strongly emphasizes that features of women’s poverty require a gender perspective in the pro poor growth strategy. Women being the most important agents of economic and social development and proportion ultra poor being higher in female headed households in comparison to that of male headed ones. “Steps Towards Change: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction-II (NSAPR-II)” has been formulated reflecting the commitment of the Government in its Election Manifesto and also in the light of the Millennium Development Goals, with particular emphasis in reducing feminized poverty. NSAPRII stresses the need for reducing feminized poverty by providing support for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) initiative of women by resource mobilization; providing credit facilities to women on easy terms; creating market linkages for women to market their products through cooperatives; providing skill development training for facilitating employment opportunities. It further envisages facilitating increased participation of women in labor force and ensuring equal wages for them. It purports to foster Rural Non-Farm Activities (RNFA) as an effective poverty reduction activity for women. In order to make this sector more vibrant, certain interventions have been identified as necessary, for example – improving marketing capacity by providing sales centers in Growth Centre markets (GCM) and pre-urban markets; providing training on food processing activities; providing basic skills about business management and steps linking them to markets; setting up vocational training institutes in rural and pre urban areas etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping in view the special aspects of women’s poverty, it has been recognized that women frequently experience poverty differently and therefore different poverty reduction priorities need to be identified and different development interventions are required. In empowering women to become equal partners of development, “Vision 2021” reflected in NSAPR-II aims to enhance women’s participation in mainstream economic activities; creating opportunities for education and marketable skills training, enabling them to participate; incorporating women’s needs and concerns in all sect oral plans; promoting enabling environment at the work place.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>Investment in women’s education and training has proven to deliver large social and economic returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In ensuring social safety net protection for vulnerable women in extreme poverty, Vulnerable Group Development Program (VGD) is providing extreme poor and distressed women food assistance along with development package training.

Positive results have been achieved in reducing maternal mortality and infant mortality through effective institutional measures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Measures to Combat Violence against Women</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In preventing violence against women legislations are in place – Prevention of Cruelty to Women and Children Act, Acid Crime Control Act, Dowry Prohibition Act, Child Marriage Restraint Act etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The draft Bill on Prevention of Domestic Violence is at the stage of finalization and steps are being taken to enact the same shortly. The Honorable High Court Division of Supreme Court of Bangladesh has recently given directives detailing a set of guidelines for action in cases of sexual harassment of women in academic institutions, workplaces and organizations. Steps are being taken to implement the directives of the Honorable Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A Committee has already been formed by the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs in compliance with the directives of the Honorable Court.

Legal assistance is provided by “Cell for Prevention of Violence against Women” in the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs and Department of Women Affairs and Jatiyo Mohila Sangstha. Ministry of Women and Children Affairs is initiating a Gender Responsive Community Policing Program to ensure security for women and girls, to address vulnerability to domestic violence and facilitate access to justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Awareness raising programs and advocacy are conducted with specific focus on engaging men and boys in prevention of violence against women and changing stereotype mind set. Policy Dialogues are held in different districts throughout the country at the grass root level emphasizing the role of men and boys in preventing violence against women. There are teenagers clubs wherein boys and girls take part in many learning activities, sports and cultural activities in a friendly environment. In eliminating discrimination against women, Bangladesh Parliament enacted Citizenship Amendment Act, 2009 giving Bangladeshi woman the right to transmit her citizenship to her children. Recognition of mother’s identity has been a milestone in promoting the cause of women’s empowerment by directing inclusion of mother’s name in the Passport and other official documents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Significant steps have been taken in effectuating political empowerment of women:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Under local govt. three seats have been reserved for direct election of women.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Under local govt. among two elected Vice- Chairman, one of which must be a woman.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· The Honorable Prime Minister is a woman, Opposition Leader, Deputy Leader of House, six Members in the Cabinet are women holding important portfolios – Ministry of Home, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Labor and Employment, and Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, which demonstrates strong political will to place women in leadership position.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· It is recommended that political parties nominate 33% women to contest directly in parliamentary elections.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>In order to ensure effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation, following steps have been adopted by the Government:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Being a cross-cutting issue, programs are implemented by Sectoral Ministries while Ministry of Women and Children Affairs as lead Ministry coordinates the functions.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Women in Development focal points mechanism exists through which Ministry of Women and Children Affairs follows up implementation by Sectoral Ministries addressing 12 areas of concern of BPFA and commitments under Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women Convention.

That’s why now a day’s we see the presence of women at a mentionable proportion at almost all of the functional sectors. However, there are many remaining challenges. Emerging challenge need to be addressed to protect women and children as vulnerable and worst sufferers of climate change and disaster situation. We need to continue to work in facing these challenges together- Government, non-governmental agencies, developing partners and friends and it is hoped that through concern effort of all, it will be possible to create an enabling environment for women- free from poverty, free from violence and free from discrimination.

Having gone through the entire matter, we got the impression that an inexperienced young Deputy commissioner, as the appellant then was, became distraught with the many Court proceedings involving him and the administration and in making his official report gave vent to his vengeful feelings by making objectionable remarks against the local judicial officers. He should not have done it. We know he would not have done it with little more experience and guidance. Not only a Government official, high or low, but everybody should try to uphold the image of the Court, not for the sake of the Court but for the sake of the society, for their own sake—warned to be careful in future.

The reportings by the contemner to the authorities against the local judicial officers are considered to malign the judicial officers which come under the mischief of contempt of court — relied on 7 DLR 34.

The trial court decreed the suit of respondent No. 2 with a direction on the BSC to reinstate him in his service as the Secretary of the Corporation. There is the simple direction given by the trial court which was upheld upto the Appellate Division. Respondent No. 2 in all his applications of joining made a prayer for fixing his seniority and that is why the appellant sought the opinion of the parent Ministry and the Legal Adviser in the matter. Immediately the opinion of the Legal Adviser was sought for without any delay and on 19.5.1994 respondent No. 2 was directed to submit a normal and proper joining report. It thus appears that within 112 months from the first letter praying for joining as Secretary, the appellant directed respondent No. 2 to file a normal joining report and to join as Secretary of BSC, but respondent No. 2 without joining moved the High Court Division in a contempt proceedings on 5.5.1994. Respondent No. 2 did not even wait for 112 months but moved the High Court Division in contempt. In the background of the admitted fact and correspondence it is difficult to hold that the appellant had wilfully shown any disrespect and disobedience towards the order of the court. As the matter was not a simpie joining report the appellant in bonafide and good faith immediately sought clarification of the Ministry and the opinion of the Legal Adviser, as directed by the Ministry. In those correspondences there was nothing to show that any contumaciousness was shown regarding the implementation of the order of the court. There was also no delay or laches on the part of the appellant in taking effective steps in implementing the courts order. We do not find that the conduct of the appellant was such of flouting the order of the court deliberately and to treat the court’s order with some degree of hatred or malice—in this case the appellant challenged the contempt Rule and filed a Counter Affidavit setting up his defence upon alternative facts and circumstances in which he acted under a bonafide and good faith. As a matter of fact he had no authority also to fix the question of fixation of seniority and promotion. Thus, in the facts of the present case probably no apology was sought for as he was in fact acting with honest belief for clarification. The apology in this case would have shown that he had committed the offence of contempt. In the present case, It appears that within 112 months of the filing of the joining report respondent No. 2 was asked to join. There was in fact no delay and no attempt was made to obstruct the order of the court. In the facts and circumstances as indicated above, we have no hesitation in our mind in holding that no contempt was committed by the appellant.

9231	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE CONTINENTAL AND CIVIL LAW LEGAL SYSTEMS</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>The Continental and Civil Law Legal Systems can be truly considered to be the most prominent legal systems in the world which laid a foundation for legislation in many countries. Although, nowadays it can be quite difficult to find a distinguished boundary between Continental and Common Law Legal Systems (as they have adopted each other’s practices to a large extent), the legal scholars point out the list of criteria which might be employed to differentiate between those two legal systems. For instance, some scholars proposed “culture” or “language” to be used for classification. Others insisted that it must be ideology which stipulates peculiarities of Continental and Common Law Legal Systems. However, most of the scholars do agree that historical background and types of the sources used are the most objective criteria.</p><p>The Continental Law Legal System takes its origin in Roman Law in times when it was first codified by Roman emperor Justinian. Justinian’s efforts resulted in compilation called Corpus Juris Civilis. The fact that Corpus Juris Civilis was a main object for study in the Italian universities of Renaissance period enabled the Roman Law to spread over the rest of Europe and greatly influence European legal systems. The result of such influence was a continued tradition of codification during the age of enlightenment (in XVIII century) when separate national codes such as The French Napoleonic Code, German and Swiss codes were developed.</p><p>The Continental Law Legal System has been formed under the influence of legal scholars whose legal doctrines became a basis for codes. Therefore, it is commonly accepted that civil law was developed in the universities rather than in courts. In other words, the written rules such as legislative statutes have been the main source of law in civil law countries. It is precisely this fact that explains a diminished judge’s role in Continental Law Legal System. Since a civil judge has to apply already existing codes for resolving cases instead of expressing his judicial opinions there is much less importance attached to a civil judge’s merit in contrast to his common counterpart.</p><p>Common or English Legal System was first developed in England and Wales. It was later adopted by many countries throughout the world as a result of British colonisation. Australia, South East Asia, India and Hong Kong are the countries with “received” common tradition. The Common Law Legal System has been developed out of unwritten rules and customs. In common countries the cases are resolved by “judge-made decisions” which follow the principle of stare decisis, i.e. “to decide similar cases similarly” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[1]</span> . This fact explains the importance of case law as a primary source of English Legal System.</p><p><strong>Procedural and Substantive Law</strong></p><p>Procedural and Substantive Law are two branches of law which can not function independently from each other.</p><p>Substantive Law can be described as a body of rules which sets out the rights and obligations of members of society <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[2]</span> . On the other hand, Procedural Law encompasses legal rules to enforce and defend such rights and obligations. For instance, it is a substantive law that defines murder as a criminal offence. Meanwhile, the Procedural Law describes the way the arrests have to be made, witnesses are questioned and evidences are collected.</p><p><strong>Civil Law and Civil Procedure versus Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure</strong></p><p>Civil Law is a form of private law and involves the relationships between individual citizens <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[3]</span> The Civil law attempts to resolve disagreements between individuals or organizations and to provide remedies. It should be emphasized that unlike criminal law, the civil law does not intend to punish the offender. Contract disputes, property disputes, divorce cases, child custody and other private matters are the issues regulated by Civil Law.</p><p>Criminal law is a branch of law which concerns crimes committed against the public authority. <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[4]</span> In contrast to Civil law where the remedy typically takes the form of compensation or fine, the offender in criminal proceeding can be punished by imprisonment, government supervision, loss of liberty, fine and even execution.</p><p>The civil and criminal procedures are different in terms of claimants bringing the case into court and parties involved in the trial process. Civil proceeding is initiated by the plaintiff represented either by an individual or an organization which strives to obtain a financial compensation for incurred damages. By contrast, any criminal proceeding is enforced by the state through the prosecutor. This happens because any crime against an individual is considered to be an offence to the society.</p><p>The prosecutor prepares evidences and charges against the accused criminal. Therefore, the burden of proof lies solely upon the prosecutor, which means that the prosecutor is responsible for providing evidences against the defendant. On the other side, the plaintiff is the only person to have the burden of proof in civil cases. Whereas it is enough for plaintiff in civil procedure to persuade that the wrongdoing was likely to take place rather than not, the prosecutor has an obligation to prove that the crime was committed without any doubts. In other words, the standard of proof in civil and criminal procedures is different: civil cases must be proven on the balance of probabilities and criminal cases – beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>In fact, the offence might be criminal and civil violation at the same time. For example, in case of car accident when there is an injured person, the driver is subject to criminal as well as civil procedure.</p><p><strong>Civil procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems</strong></p><p>The significant differences in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems are stipulated mainly by the adherence either to the so-called “inquisitorial” or “adversarial” systems. Despite the fact that there have been a lot of borrowings recently in both systems, “inquisitorial” tradition is broadly defined as a prerogative of Continental Law trials, whereas Common Law trials follow “adversarial” system.</p><p>One of the factors which explain the substantial differences in civil procedures of Common and Continental Legal Systems is a judge’s role. In civil procedure governed by continental tradition the judge examines the evidences, questions the witnesses and prepares report, i.e. controls all aspects of the trial. Meanwhile, the role of judge in common civil procedure is that of a passive observer listening to the arguments and evidences presented both by a plaintiff and a defendant. Therefore, a Continental Law judge bears more responsibility for the trial rather than his Common Law counterpart.</p><p>Another point of divergence in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems is the stages of jurisdiction. In continental civil procedure these stages can be defined as preliminary stage, evidence-taking stage and decision making stage. As it can be noticed, the continental civil procedure never includes the trial stage which is sometimes a part of civil procedure in Common Legal System. This can be explained by the fact that in Common Legal System the trial is believed to be a final stage which necessarily includes a jury. Therefore, under such definition the trial does not exist in continental civil procedure. Instead of the trial the continental civil procedure consists of “a series of isolated meetings and written communications between counsel and the judgeâ€¦” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[5]</span></p><p>The next important difference concerns an evidence-taking stage. As a matter of fact, the common lawyer is obliged to formulate the whole case at the very beginning which is an unusual practice for civil lawyers who prepares only some pieces of evidence for the first appearance before the court. Consequently, the degree of importance assigned to discovery process is much less in continental civil procedure rather than in common.</p><p>Although in continental civil procedure the judge is directly involved in the evidence-taking part of the proceeding, the case should be resolved by other judges. In contrast, the examination of evidences and the resolution of civil case are direct obligations of a single judge in common law tradition.</p><p>The continental and common civil procedure uses written and oral arguments respectively. For example, during the witness testimony in common civil procedure the questions are asked orally by the advocates of both parties, whereas it is compulsory for the continental advocate to propose a question in written form to judge who can either accept or reject it. This example illustrates not only the difference in common and continental civil procedure in terms of oral or written arguments but also in the presence of cross-examination. In other words, cross-examination does not take place in continental civil procedure.</p><p>Civil procedures in Common and Continental Legal Systems differ in terms of parties who incur counsel fees. In the former case, except for England, counsel fees must be paid by each party regardless of the case’s outcome. On the other hand, in civil law countries, the loser covers the winner’s counsel fees.</p><p><strong>Criminal procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems</strong></p><p>A lot of differences in civil procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems discussed above can be applied to criminal procedure as well. The explanation beyond this is what tradition, adversarial or inquisitorial, the Legal System follows. For example, the role of impartial referee assigned to the judge in common civil procedure is the same for judge in common criminal procedure. Alternatively, in both continental civil and criminal cases the judge acts as an inquisitor. Moreover, the witness testimony in criminal procedure of both legal systems follows the same pattern as in civil procedure. However, there are some distinctive differences which uniquely determine criminal procedure in Common and Continental Legal Systems.</p><p>First of all, the criminal case in Common Legal System is initiated by the wronged person, his relatives or any other member of the society. A presiding officer is appointed then to hear and decide the case. By contrast, the private accuser in continental criminal procedure is replaced by public official, who represents the State’s interests. In other words, the contest has shifted from two individuals to an individual and the State.</p><p>Secondly, the difference can be found in examining phase of criminal proceeding. At this stage the evidences are collected followed by compilation of the dossier. While it is allowed to disclose the dossier to the defense in continental criminal proceeding it is prohibited in common legal proceeding.</p><p>Thirdly, in common criminal procedure the defendant must be sworn and can not refuse to answer while being questioned. On the contrary, this practice is not applied to criminal justice system in continental countries where the case is exactly the opposite.</p><p>Another important difference in criminal procedure of Common and Continental Legal Systems is plea bargaining. In contrast to common criminal procedure where plea bargaining is a distinctive feature, the prosecutor power is limited in continental countries. Moreover, in common countries “the defendant who pleads guilty forgoes a trial” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[6]</span> . In civil countries, however, the plea guilty is not a hard evidence for defendant’s guilt. Therefore, the trial necessary takes place.</p><p>Finally, it is wrongly believed that there are no concepts of jury trial and presumption of innocence in civil criminal proceedings. In fact, “a legal presumption of innocence does exist in many civil law jurisdictions” <span class="essay_footnotecitation">[7]</span> , although in some civil countries it may not exist as a formal rule of law. Similarly, the jury trial is replaced with lay advisers. However, the verdict of lay advisers is not always a conclusive ruling for the defendant to be accused or acquitted.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In conclusion, I would like to say that as our world tends to move toward globalization the borders between Continental and Common Law Legal systems, and as a result, between procedures of those systems become feebly marked. As an example, Continental Legal System has started to rely more on previous cases whereas a lot of importance is attached to statutes in modern common law countries. Base themselves upon that fact, a lot of legal scholars speak out in support of convergence theory which suggests a creation of single legislation for all countries throughout the world. Will this theory ever become a reality? Time will show. However, to my point of view, before it becomes possible we have to reach the convergence of cultures, ideologies, moral values and political attitudes.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The contractual characteristics of agency relationships which is to be justified and evaluated on the basis of <i>Law of Contract, 1872</i>-illustrate &amp; explain</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Introduction</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The agency relationship is a very common phenomenon in the business world today. Almost all the companies in today’s business arena deal with agents and third parties and this is nothing new. For over hundreds of years, each and every business has laid their footstep into some sort of agency relationships and those were all contractual. The respective topic talks about the contractual characteristics of agency relationships which, is to be justified and evaluated on the basis of <i>Law of Contract, 1872</i>. In accordance with the learning and perceptual belief of this society reflected from various <i>great philosophers</i>, a contractual agreement cannot be terminated without each party’s free consent and knowledge of the situation. However, it might be remotely correct to conclude this that the act of termination of contract without the knowledge of the agent might not be invalid if done after rescission of the contract. Many thousands of contracts form each day but all of them do not perform according to their terms. Often discussion and negotiations can resolve matters and sometimes the contract itself provides some <i>mechanism</i> for resolving disputes among parties using different clauses included in the contract paper. While in other cases, the difficulties caused by breach of contract cannot be resolved informally. The law has to provide a range of <i>remedies</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> to enable the party being affected by the breach to obtain either the performance contracted for or some compensation for not receiving it. Similarly, law might also provide a provision for rescission of a contract. Understanding it clearly would require us to deal with the in-depth understanding of the way agency is formed and the reasons for which contractual agreement might be breached and rescinded in the light of the Law of Contract, 1872. The Law of Contract is derived from the Indian Contract Act and thereby this research would entail extensive synonymous use of the both the phrases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, this paper would deal with the descriptive overview of contracts and agency relationship and then moving the spot light towards validity of termination upon <i>rescission</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> of a contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Agency relationship and Termination </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. Agency and Relationships</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Agency in simple term is a sort of a collaboration or relationship between parties. It is the relation that is eminent between persons where one of the persons holds the power or ability to create lawful relationship with another having connections with other third parties. An agency relationship is established within two parties where one of the parties is an agent and the other a principal.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> An agent is employed to work for the principal performing tasks, selling goods, managing business including dealing with third parties etc. This particular relationship is <i>fiduciary</i> and is governed by employment law. However, this is a contractual relationship and both parties agree upon certain terms to come into the contract under the consideration that the agent will be obligated to work for the principal for a specified time in order to maintain collaboration and dealings with the third parties. But this relationship does not require any <i>consideration.</i> This contract is under the law of agency governed by the <i>Indian Contract Act, 1872</i>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The agency relationship might end in various following ways:</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li><i>By the principal revoking the agency. </i>Although the principal cannot perform such actions if the agency deals with interest. Agencies are tied with interests when the agent has an interest in the subject matter of the agency <i>(illustrated in Section 201</i>).</li><li>By the agent renouncing the business of the agency.</li><li>By the business of agency being completed.</li><li>By the principal being <i>adjudicated insolvent</i></li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. Termination of an Agency Relationship</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The termination of an agency relationship can take place in various ways. After termination, the agent would not have the authority to work for the principal. It is the responsibility of the principal to inform third parties that the relationship no longer exists. The following are the ways agencies are terminated.</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>Lapse of time: After the time period for the agency relationship is passed.</li><li>Purpose achieved: After the purpose of the relationship or contract is fulfilled.</li><li>Mutual agreement: Both the parties come into a termination agreement.</li><li>Certain events: Agency terminations automatically if there is any occurrence of death, insanity, or bankruptcy of either the principal or agent.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">If the agency is wrongfully terminated, then either party can sue the other under both contract and employment law accusing breach of a contract or employment law violation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Contracts and types; Law of Contract, 1872</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A contract is simple terms is an agreement between two parties that is supported by law. While an agreement is defined as a promise between two parties which can take place only when an offer is made to one and that particular offer is accepted by the other. When this agreement is enforced by law, it becomes standardized to a contract. According to <i>Sir William Anson</i>, <i>“A contract is an agreement enforceable at law made between two or more persons, by which rights are acquired by one or more acts or forbearances on the part of the other or others.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""></a></i> In a nutshell, legally any contract is an agreement which is enforceable by the law. A formal definition of the contract can be found in the Indian Contract Act 1872, which defines agreement as “Every promise and every set of promises forming consideration for each other.”<i> Section 2(b)</i> defines promise in these words: “When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted”; While, <i>Section 2(h) </i>defines the contract as an agreement enforceable by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For a contract to valid, there are certain things that should be maintained and present in that contract which are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. <b>Proper offer and acceptance:</b> an agreement based on a legitimate offer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. <b>Lawful Consideration:</b> the contract should be supported by a consideration which means something in return. It can be monetary, an action or abstinence from an action. It can take place in the past, present or future but these considerations should be real and bounded by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. <b>Competent to contract or capacity:</b> For the contract to be valid, all the parties should be matured, should be in sound mind and should not be incapable of forming any contract by any law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. <b>Free consent: </b>The parties should form the contract willingly using genuine information and consent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. <b>Lawful object and agreement:</b> The object of the agreement or the action of the agreement should not be illegal or unlawful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. <b>Agreement not declared void or illegal:</b> Agreements which are stated and considered void or illegal by any law are not supported at law; thereby the contract would not be valid.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. <b>Intention to Create Legal Relationships: </b>When parties enter into an agreement, the intention must be to create a legal relationship between them</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. <b>Certainty:</b> The contract should not be unclear or ambiguous vague and everything should be articulated with optimum clarity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. <b>Possibility of Performance:</b> The promise of the agreement should not be impossible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. <b>Legal Formalities:</b> Agreement without consideration is not valid. Consideration must be there which can be present, past or future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are three types of contract which are Express contract, Implied contract and Quasi Contract. The stages involved in a contract are the formation of a contract, execution of a contract and remedies for the breach of a contract. These remedies for the breach of a contract would vastly come into consideration for a proper explanation of the topic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. Formation and Execution of a contract </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Formation of the contract takes place when the creation and acceptance of the agreement from both parties (multiple parties can also exist) is accomplished. Both parties upon a defined consideration<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> agree to come into a contract and thereby the formation of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Execution of the contract means the exchange of the consideration or the performance of the contract. Any contract creates an obligation for both the parties. Carrying out these obligations is the performance of the contract. All the parties execute or promise to perform with some obligations. According to the <i>Section 37, “The parties to a contract must either perform or offer to perform, their respective promises, unless such performance is dispense with or excused under the provision of this act, or of any other law.” <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><b>[6]</b></a></i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. Remedies for breach of a contract</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After the contract is successfully executed, the most important element is the remedies for the contract if the contract is breached which are as follows.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li><b>Damages :</b> Compensation for the loss of a breach</li><li><b>Action for the price:</b> Failure to payment</li><li><b>Quantum meruit:</b> Legitimate payment for the value of what is done.</li><li><b>Specific performance:</b> An order by the court for the performance execution</li><li><b>Injunction:</b> An order by the court for observing negative restrictions.</li><li><b>Rescission:</b> Cancellation of the agreement or contract.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>For the purpose of our research, studying Rescission of a contract would be adequate to understand why the termination of the relationship between an agent and a principal would be valid even if the agent is not informed about it. </i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>c. Rescission</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, rescission is the cancellation of the contract. The contract is terminated such that no contract existed which required bringing all the parties back to the point before they entered into the contract. Thereby, all the benefits received from the contract should be refunded. However, rescission is not particularly a remedy for the breach of a contract rather an equitable right for both the parties to rescind the agreement. Rescission might occur due to innocent or fraudulent representation, common mistakes, inadequate legal capacity, presence of an impractical performance to be executed for the contract not contemplated by the parties, or duress and undue influences. For example, assume that you came to an agreement with a buyer that you would sell your apartment that you thought to be yours. However, it was found out that you the property did not belong to you; thereby rescission would be the remedy in this case. Rescission is a useful remedy and it gives the suffering party to terminate unsatisfactory contractual relationships, claim money for damages and start a new contract with other parties. For the execution of rescission, the following conditions must be fulfilled.</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>Both the parties should be able to return to their <i>initial conditions</i>. By any chance, if the conditions have changed that they cannot go back to their initial state, equity will not allow rescission.</li><li>When an innocent third party/client persists the right in this matter of the contract and embargoes the process of rescission for his/her interest.</li><li>The rescission is exercised within a <i>given time</i>.</li><li>The affirmation of the contract by a person either <i>expressed or implied</i>.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">Rescission might occur willingly by both parties or even for misrepresentations or fraudulent behavior. For example, rescissions occur at times in insurance policies where in situations the policy takers misrepresent their information intentionally, the insurance company terminates/rescinds the policy contract of the applicant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. Findings</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The following are the findings and understandings form the research and literature reviews.</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>The Relationships between agents and principals are bounded by contract and is under the Law of Contract.</li><li>These relationships require <i>legitimate reasons</i> to be terminated. However, might get automatically terminated if the contract is found to be invalid being assessed under the Contract law, 1872. Any violations to the elements of contractual validity make the contract void.</li><li>The termination of the contract might also be for the rescission of the contract.</li><li>The rescission of the contract may or may not require the approval of both the parties of the agency depending on the situations.</li><li>Rescission might occur for many reasons including misrepresentation and fraud.</li><li>Rescission means that the contract does not exist any longer which implies that further termination of the contract may not be necessary.</li><li>After rescission has occurred, the agent need not inform or acknowledge the agent regarding termination of the contract as the contract no longer exist. However, the principal must inform the third parties regarding the cancellation of the contract.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. Conclusion </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Agencies are formed by a contractual agreement between the principal and the agent under certain circumstances and voluntary termination of the contract is not appropriate. The agent may sue the principal if the contract is terminated unlawfully as the agent might possess rights on his interests and might get affected financially through the act of termination. Thereby, the agent must be informed and reasoned with legitimate grounds for the termination of the contract if done before expiration of the contract or fulfillment of the purpose. However, if the contract is rescinded before the termination of the contract, the principal would not have to inform or notify the agent regarding the termination. This is due to these reasons that rescission may occur for various reasons including unethical and unlawful business activities (within the contractual agreement of the agency) or for committing fraud by the agent leading to an unsatisfactory performance for the principal. In addition, the contract after rescission is already ended and bring forth to a position as if the contract never existed, the principal do not have any obligation towards the agent. Thereby, it can be concluded that the act of termination by the principal without the knowledge of the agent done after rescission is not invalid in accordance to the Law of Contract, 1872.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bibliography</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Contract of Agency.</i> (2001).

When this agreement is enforced by law, it becomes standardized to a contract. According to <i>Sir William Anson</i>, <i>“A contract is an agreement enforceable at law made between two or more persons, by which rights are acquired by one or more acts or forbearances on the part of the other or others.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><b>[4]</b></a></i> In a nutshell, legally any contract is an agreement which is enforceable by the law. A formal definition of the contract can be found in the Indian Contract Act 1872, which defines agreement as “Every promise and every set of promises forming consideration for each other.”<i> Section 2(b)</i> defines promise in these words: “When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted”; While, <i>Section 2(h) </i>defines the contract as an agreement enforceable by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For a contract to valid, there are certain things that should be maintained and present in that contract which are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. <b>Proper offer and acceptance:</b> an agreement based on a legitimate offer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. <b>Lawful Consideration:</b> the contract should be supported by a consideration which means something in return. It can be monetary, an action or abstinence from an action. It can take place in the past, present or future but these considerations should be real and bounded by law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. <b>Competent to contract or capacity:</b> For the contract to be valid, all the parties should be matured, should be in sound mind and should not be incapable of forming any contract by any law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. <b>Free consent: </b>The parties should form the contract willingly using genuine information and consent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. <b>Lawful object and agreement:</b> The object of the agreement or the action of the agreement should not be illegal or unlawful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. <b>Agreement not declared void or illegal:</b> Agreements which are stated and considered void or illegal by any law are not supported at law; thereby the contract would not be valid.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. <b>Intention to Create Legal Relationships: </b>When parties enter into an agreement, the intention must be to create a legal relationship between them</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. <b>Certainty:</b> The contract should not be unclear or ambiguous vague and everything should be articulated with optimum clarity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. <b>Possibility of Performance:</b> The promise of the agreement should not be impossible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. <b>Legal Formalities:</b> Agreement without consideration is not valid. Consideration must be there which can be present, past or future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are three types of contract which are Express contract, Implied contract and Quasi Contract. The stages involved in a contract are the formation of a contract, execution of a contract and remedies for the breach of a contract. These remedies for the breach of a contract would vastly come into consideration for a proper explanation of the topic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>a. Formation and Execution of a contract </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Formation of the contract takes place when the creation and acceptance of the agreement from both parties (multiple parties can also exist) is accomplished. Both parties upon a defined consideration<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> agree to come into a contract and thereby the formation of the contract.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Execution of the contract means the exchange of the consideration or the performance of the contract. Any contract creates an obligation for both the parties. Carrying out these obligations is the performance of the contract. All the parties execute or promise to perform with some obligations. According to the <i>Section 37, “The parties to a contract must either perform or offer to perform, their respective promises, unless such performance is dispense with or excused under the provision of this act, or of any other law.” <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><b>[6]</b></a></i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>b. Remedies for breach of a contract</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">After the contract is successfully executed, the most important element is the remedies for the contract if the contract is breached which are as follows.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li><b>Damages :</b> Compensation for the loss of a breach</li><li><b>Action for the price:</b> Failure to payment</li><li><b>Quantum meruit:</b> Legitimate payment for the value of what is done.</li><li><b>Specific performance:</b> An order by the court for the performance execution</li><li><b>Injunction:</b> An order by the court for observing negative restrictions.</li><li><b>Rescission:</b> Cancellation of the agreement or contract.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>For the purpose of our research, studying Rescission of a contract would be adequate to understand why the termination of the relationship between an agent and a principal would be valid even if the agent is not informed about it. </i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>c. Rescission</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, rescission is the cancellation of the contract. The contract is terminated such that no contract existed which required bringing all the parties back to the point before they entered into the contract. Thereby, all the benefits received from the contract should be refunded. However, rescission is not particularly a remedy for the breach of a contract rather an equitable right for both the parties to rescind the agreement. Rescission might occur due to innocent or fraudulent representation, common mistakes, inadequate legal capacity, presence of an impractical performance to be executed for the contract not contemplated by the parties, or duress and undue influences. For example, assume that you came to an agreement with a buyer that you would sell your apartment that you thought to be yours. However, it was found out that you the property did not belong to you; thereby rescission would be the remedy in this case. Rescission is a useful remedy and it gives the suffering party to terminate unsatisfactory contractual relationships, claim money for damages and start a new contract with other parties. For the execution of rescission, the following conditions must be fulfilled.</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>Both the parties should be able to return to their <i>initial conditions</i>. By any chance, if the conditions have changed that they cannot go back to their initial state, equity will not allow rescission.</li><li>When an innocent third party/client persists the right in this matter of the contract and embargoes the process of rescission for his/her interest.</li><li>The rescission is exercised within a <i>given time</i>.</li><li>The affirmation of the contract by a person either <i>expressed or implied</i>.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;">Rescission might occur willingly by both parties or even for misrepresentations or fraudulent behavior. For example, rescissions occur at times in insurance policies where in situations the policy takers misrepresent their information intentionally, the insurance company terminates/rescinds the policy contract of the applicant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. Findings</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The following are the findings and understandings form the research and literature reviews.</p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>The Relationships between agents and principals are bounded by contract and is under the Law of Contract.</li><li>These relationships require <i>legitimate reasons</i> to be terminated. However, might get automatically terminated if the contract is found to be invalid being assessed under the Contract law, 1872. Any violations to the elements of contractual validity make the contract void.</li><li>The termination of the contract might also be for the rescission of the contract.</li><li>The rescission of the contract may or may not require the approval of both the parties of the agency depending on the situations.</li><li>Rescission might occur for many reasons including misrepresentation and fraud.</li><li>Rescission means that the contract does not exist any longer which implies that further termination of the contract may not be necessary.</li><li>After rescission has occurred, the agent need not inform or acknowledge the agent regarding termination of the contract as the contract no longer exist. However, the principal must inform the third parties regarding the cancellation of the contract.</li></ol><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. Conclusion </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Agencies are formed by a contractual agreement between the principal and the agent under certain circumstances and voluntary termination of the contract is not appropriate. The agent may sue the principal if the contract is terminated unlawfully as the agent might possess rights on his interests and might get affected financially through the act of termination. Thereby, the agent must be informed and reasoned with legitimate grounds for the termination of the contract if done before expiration of the contract or fulfillment of the purpose. However, if the contract is rescinded before the termination of the contract, the principal would not have to inform or notify the agent regarding the termination. This is due to these reasons that rescission may occur for various reasons including unethical and unlawful business activities (within the contractual agreement of the agency) or for committing fraud by the agent leading to an unsatisfactory performance for the principal. In addition, the contract after rescission is already ended and bring forth to a position as if the contract never existed, the principal do not have any obligation towards the agent. Thereby, it can be concluded that the act of termination by the principal without the knowledge of the agent done after rescission is not invalid in accordance to the Law of Contract, 1872.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bibliography</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Contract of Agency.</i> (2001).

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“The control over delegated legislation is the most critical aspect of Administrative law as otherwise subordinate can easily be drafted arbitrarily”. Discus</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1 <strong>Introduction</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There has been delegated legislation in England since the fourteenth century. In modern times, in all the countries, there has been a steady increase in the use of delegated legislation. At present, on almost all the countries, the technique of delegated legislation is restored to and some legislative powers are delegated by the legislature to the executive. At the same time, there is inherent danger of abuse of the said power of the executive authorities. Delegated legislation has become inevitable but the question of control has become crucial<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2 Delegated legislation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Delegated legislation (also referred to as secondary legislation or subordinate legislation or subsidiary legislation) is law made by an executive authority under powers given to them by primary legislation in order to implement and administer the requirements of that primary legislation. It is law made by a person or body other than the legislature but with the legislature’s authority. Often, a legislature passes statutes that set out broad outlines and principles, and delegates authority to an executive branch official to issue delegated legislation that flesh out the details (substantive regulations) and provide procedures for implementing the substantive provisions of the statute and substantive regulations (procedural regulations). Delegated legislation can also be changed faster than primary legislation so legislatures can delegate issues that may need to be fine-tuned through experience.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under section 15(1) of the Constitution Act 1986, Parliament has full power to make laws. Parliament usually exercises this power to pass primary legislation (that is, Acts of Parliament). However, Parliament also has the power to confer its law-making power on another person or body, thus enabling that person or body to make laws. This process is the delegation of Parliament’s legislative power, and the resulting laws are known as delegated legislation. Unlike Parliament, which has unlimited powers, the delegated powers are limited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In accordance with the above concepts we can understand that, Delegated legislation is a process of giving authority to some entity other than the primary legislative body to enact and execute laws. This gives the delegated authority tremendous amount of power without the usual process of selecting a democratic representative by the people.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For example: In Bangladesh, to handle law and order situation some power has been delegated to R.A.B under the authority of home minister. Other legislatures don’t have direct control over R.A.B force. This law and order force is accountable to the home minister.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3 Types of delegated legislation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The following are the three main <strong>types of delegated legislation</strong><b>:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.1 By Laws:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">They are made by Local Authorities to deal with matters within their particular locality3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.2 Statutory Instruments:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">These are made by Government Ministers and they insert the detail to Acts of Parliament. Statutory Instruments make up the majority of delegated legislation that is made. Around 3,000 Statutory Instruments are issued each year<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.3 Orders in Council:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">They are made by the Queen on the advice of the Government and are usually made when Parliament is not sitting. They can be used by the Government in emergency situations3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4 Necessity of delegated legislation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Delegated legislation is necessary for a number of reasons:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Parliament does not have time to contemplate and debate every small detail of complex regulations, as it only has a limited amount of time to pass legislation, delegating legislation will allow however thoroughly debated regulations to pass through as well as saving parliamentary time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Delegating legislation allows law to be made more quickly than parliament, which is vital for times of emergency. Parliament takes longer as it does not sit all the time and its procedures is generally quite slow and complex due to the several stages each bill has to pass through. Delegated legislation can also be amended or revoked relatively easily, so that the law can be kept up to date and so that the law can meet future needs that arise such as areas concerning welfare benefits, illustrating a great deal of flexibility in the system. Otherwise statutes can only be amended or revoked by another complicated and time-consuming statute.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· MPs do not usually have the technical knowledge/expertise required in for example drawing up laws on controlling technology, ensuring environmental safety, and dealing with different industrial problems or operating complex taxation schemes whereas delegated legislation can use experts who are familiar with the relevant areas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Another argument for the need of delegated legislation is that parliament may not always be the best institution to recognize and deal with the needs of local people. As a result local people elect councilors from certain districts and it is their responsibility to pass legislation in the form of by-laws to satisfy local needs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5 Controls of Delegated legislation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.1 General control methods</strong></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.1.1 Consultation</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The creators consult experts in the relevant field; for example, a SI on road traffic law may be referred to the AA. The enabling Act may make such consultation compulsory.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.1.2 Publication</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">All DL is published, therefore is available for public scrutiny.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.2 Parliamentary Control</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Parliament has initial control over statutory instruments as it passes an enabling Act, which gives other bodies or individuals the power to make rules and regulations. Thus, Parliament is able to limit the powers of those creating delegated legislation, and set out specific procedures for bringing statutory instruments into force, for example in the Eynesbury Mushroom case (1972), in which the Minister for Labour had to consult ‘any organization appearing to him to be representative of substantial numbers of employers engaging in the activity concerned’ and the fact that he didn’t consult the Mushroom Growers’ Association, meant that his order that established a training board, was void against mushroom growers. This is also demonstrated in R v Home Secretary, ex parte Fire Brigades Union (1995), which decided that changes the Home Secretary made to the Criminal Injuries Compensation scheme were beyond the power he was given by the enabling act, the Criminal Justice Act 1988, this case decided that any delegated legislation which is ultra vires, beyond its powers, is void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, Parliament initially has the ability to limit the powers of bodies and individuals creating delegated legislation, and set down procedure to be followed in their creation; and if those creating the delegated legislation do go beyond their powers, then the legislation will be void.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, often enabling acts will grant very wide powers to bodies or individuals creating delegated legislation, such as section 8 of the Access to Justice Act 1999, which sets out criteria for the Community Legal Service to consider when offering public funding, but also allows the criteria to include ‘such other factors as the Lord Chancellor may by order require the Commission to consider’, thus the Lord Chancellor was given the power to add to the criteria without referring it to Parliament and with little real control over the additions he could make.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.2.1 Affirmative resolutions</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Another type of control, which some statutory instruments may be subject to, if stated in the enabling act, is affirmative resolutions. This procedure means that statutory instruments must be approved by Parliament before they can become law. This means that Parliament has more control over a piece of delegated legislation, being able to debate it and vote upon whether it should become law. This guarantees that the statutory instrument is brought to Parliament’s attention and seems more democratic, as it allows those democratically elected by the people to decide whether a piece of delegated legislation becomes law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, time is needed for parliamentary debate on the delegated legislation, and this is scarce, lack of time for parliament to introduce all the necessary legislation being one of the original reasons why delegated legislation is considered necessary. Also, although this could be seen as the most active example of control over delegated legislation, only a small number of statutory instruments are subject to affirmative resolution and thus this strength of control.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">5.2.2 Negative resolution</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Negative resolution is the most common form of control and most other statutory instruments will be subject to it. It means that the statutory instrument will become law within a specified time, of normally 40 days, unless it is rejected by Parliament. Any member of Parliament may put down a motion to annul a piece of delegated legislation within that time, and if either the House of Lords or House of Commons passes an annulment motion then the delegated legislation does not become law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Negative resolution allows parliament to retain control over whether a piece of legislation should become law, but only necessitates debate if members of Parliament do not agree with it. Thus it allows Parliament control without wasting parliamentary time as positive resolutions may do.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, where positive resolutions could be seen as more active control over delegated legislation, negative resolutions could be described as a more passive process, with delegated legislation becoming law without any parliamentary intervention or a vote in parliament. Also, although any member of parliament has the right to put down a motion to annul a piece of delegated legislation, in practice motions from backbenchers may not be dealt with, although one from the Official Opposition is almost certain to be, and thus not all opinions and uncertainties members of Parliament may have, regarding a piece of delegated legislation, are considered.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc351088805"></a>5.2.3 Scrutiny Committee</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Another effective check on delegated legislation is the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, or the Scrutiny Committee. The Scrutiny Committee reviews all statutory instruments and draws the attention of parliament to certain points, if the statutory instrument; imposes a tax, is made under an Act which states it cannot be challenged in court, is designed to have retrospective effect, may be beyond powers or an unusual use of them, or is badly drafted or in need of clarification.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Scrutiny Committee<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> is very active in its control and thoroughly reviews all statutory instruments in a way it would be impossible for parliament to do, looking at all of the technical details within the piece of delegated legislation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However the Scrutiny Committee does not look at the overall policy the statutory instrument is implementing has a large volume of statutory instruments to deal with, meaning it can be difficult to fully review all of them and most importantly has very limited powers. The Scrutiny Committee cannot make any alterations to statutory instruments, it can only report its findings back to the Houses of Parliament, and they are not always taken into consideration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc351088806"></a><strong>5.3 Judicial Control</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A final control over delegated legislation is control by the courts; Delegated legislation is also subject to control by the courts whose judges can declare a piece of delegated legislation to be ultra vires. Ultra vires means ‘beyond powers’, so the court would be saying that a piece of delegated legislation went beyond the powers granted by Parliament within the enabling Act. If the court does this, then the delegated legislation in question would be void and not effective.There are two types of ultra vires:</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc351088807"></a>5.3.1 Procedural ultra vires</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the enabling Act sets out the procedural rules to be followed by the body which has been given the delegated power. The court can find the delegated legislation to be ultra vires and void if these rules were not followed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the Aylesbury Mushroom case (1972) Agricultural Horticultural and Forestry Industry Training Board v Aylesbury Mushrooms Ltd (1972) 1 All ER 280 delegated legislation required the Minister of Labour to consult ‘any organisation … appearing to him to be representative of substantial numbers of employers engaging in the activity concerned’ about the establishment of a training board. The Minister failed to consult the Mushroom Growers’ Association which represented about 85 per cent of all mushroom growers. Therefore, the delegated legislation was declared to be ultra vires on procedural grounds.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc351088808"></a>5.3.2 Substantial ultra virus</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the delegated legislation goes beyond what Parliament intended.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte National Union of Teachers(2000) QBD, the High Court determined that an SI concerning teachers’ pay and appraisal arrangements went beyond the powers provided under the Education Act 1996. Therefore, the delegated legislation was declared to be ultra vires on substantive grounds.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6 <a name="_Toc351088809"></a>Importance of Control over Delegated Legislation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As delegated legislation is not made by Parliament, and therefore not those democratically elected by the public to be responsible for legislation, apart from delegated legislation created by elected local authorities, it is important to have sufficient controls. Sub-delegation is a problem with delegated legislation, as the creation of the legislation is delegated further, such as by a government minister, who was originally given the power to make delegated legislation by the enabling act, to civil servants within the department. This means power is taken even further from those elected and continues to make delegated legislation appear undemocratic and in need of strict controls.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another point to consider is that delegated legislation is generally made privately, rather than being debated as parliamentary legislation is, and thus, although the enabling act may require some public consultation, delegated legislation could be seen as much less open and publicized than statutes. Also, although delegated legislation is published, the vast quantities produced and complex wording mean delegated legislation is criticized for being difficult for people to fully understand, and therefore may not be very open to public scrutiny or involvement in its creation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus the main reason that controls over delegated legislation are necessary is because it is not created by Parliament and often not even those given the responsibility by Parliament, but is further sub-delegated. This means that the public are not able to elect those making legislation, as they are with Parliament, and thus those making delegated legislation are not accountable to the people, so delegated legislation can seem undemocratic and a particular problem if it is used for more important policies, and not simply administrative rules.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="_Toc351088810"></a><strong>7 References</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Martin . <b>‘The English Legal System’ </b>– Hodder &amp; Stoughton (2002)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Elliott C. &amp; Quinn F. <b>‘AS Law’ </b>– Longman (2002)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Charman M., Vanstone B. &amp; Sherratt L. <b>‘AS Law’ </b>Willian Publishing (2003)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Aylesbury Mushroom case (1972)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· R.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Daryl Fitzsimons</p><p>MRH2</p><p>The European Union is made up of 27 member states, mainly consisting of countries in Europe. It acts as an economic and political bond. The Treaty of Paris was finalised in 1951 by the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, France, Germany and Luxembourg. This was led by the setting up of the European Coal and Steel Community which is abbreviated to the ECSC, signed by Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Alcide De Gasperi and Paul-Henri Spaak. The treaty was agreed to with the goal to generate and ensure diplomatic and economic stability.</p><p>The ECSC then established a single market amongst them, known as the EEC which stands for European Economic Community. This was planned to become the trading entity to facilitate the customs union and it also led to all internal customs duties being abolished among the six countries. The EEC zone centered around the concept of several freedoms, Freedom of services, Freedom of capital, Freedom of people and finally Freedom of goods</p><p>The market was initiated once the treaty of Paris was signed. But, coinciding with this event a separate treaty was signed that led to the establishing of Euratom, the European Atomic Energy Community. The intended aim of this was to gather all the resources of its members that were non-military.</p><p>The various different governing bodies such as the ECSC, EEC and Euratom were all joined through the Merger Treaty of 1967 to form the European Communities. In 1993 Europe became divided into two the democratic governments holding one side the communists states holding another (the eastern bloc as itâ€™s sometimes called).</p><p>The countries were part of a defence agreement known as the Warsaw Pact. It was in response to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, a military alliance consisting of members from North America and Europe. It gave the Soviet Union power to intervene, if anything threatened their Communist ideology. But, in 2004, the countries involved had turned towards embracing democracy over their previous communist beliefs. When countries such as Poland and Hungary joined the NATO agreement, Bulgaria, Latvia, Romania and others followed suit in 2004. It was then that The European Union was complete.</p><p>Institutions</p><p>The European Union itself does not decide on the actual laws for its member states but rather decides steers the overall political direction of its members there are three main institutions involved in EU legislation:</p><p>The European Parliament:</p><p>The European Parliament parliamentary institution of the European Union</p><p>It executes the legislative of the EU and it has been described as one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.</p><p>The Parliament is currently made up of 754 Members of the European Parliament, who represent the second largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) but is it is the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world</p><p>Although the European Parliament holds legal powers that the other institutions within the EU do not hold. It does not actually possess legislative initiative, Parliament is listed as the “first institution” of the EU (mentioned first in the treaties, giving it leading ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level making it arguably the “face” of EU), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except in a few areas where the special legislative procedures apply). It also shares budget control with the council.</p><p>The Council of the European Union</p><p>The Council represent the governments of individual member countries Aside from passing laws with the European Parliament, the Council also reviews the annual budget, Elaborates and helps specify vague economic policies of its member states, Develops foreign and defence policies Co-ordinates cooperation between the courts and police forces Negotiates and develops economic polices</p><p>At each meeting of the Council, a representative from each country is provided to determine the aspects of which they represent the minister for agriculture would be sent from Ireland to a Council meeting regarding his field of work. This meeting would then be known as the â€˜Agriculture Councilâ€™.</p><p>European commission</p><p>This is one of the three primary institutions of the European Union it serves the day-to-day maintenance of the EU, upholding the Union’s treaties and its overall interests.</p><p>Is it is composed of 27 Commissioners who are appointed specific policy areas. An elected commission president is selected. And then 26 other commissioners in agreement are appointed before being subject to approval before a European council they are tasked with representing the EU as a whole rather than their member state.</p><p>They propose new laws to the Parliament, allocate the budget, enforce all EU laws and represent them internationally.</p><p>The Commission is used to speak on behalf of the EU amongst such bodies as the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p><p>European Council</p><p>The European Council is the group of heads of state or government of the EU member states. Meeting are held four times a year to pinpoint and specify the Union’s policy agenda and discuss further integration and expansion of states it has been described as the highest political body of the European Union.</p><p>Court of Justice of the European Union</p><p>The Court of Justice of the European Union acts as the EU’s judicial arm. It is responsible for interpreting EU law and treaties. It comprises the main chamber: Court of Justice, the General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal.</p><p>The Central Bank</p><p>The European Central Bank is the central bank for the euro zone and thus governs monetary policy it is also entrusted to maintain monetary stability so that euro does not fluctuate to wildly. It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks which comprises all EU national banks. It is controlled by a board of national bank governors and an elected President.</p><p>Court of Auditors</p><p>The European Court of Auditors is tasked with ensuring the taxpayer funds from the budget of the European Union is spent accurately and fairly. They must ensure spending is justified meaning money is not squandered or improperly used that it is spent on what was agreed and a fair at a fair amount or price. They provide a report for each financial year to the European Council and Parliament bodies. The Parliament then decides if they will approve the Commission’s handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.</p><p><strong>Expansion</strong></p><p>the EU began with a somewhat modest six member states Germany(west at the time) Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands sometimes known as the “inner six these countries where first to adopt the idea of European trans-national community while sceptics looked on then 1973 Denmark, UK and Ireland were added Norway had also applied but later declined in 1981 Greece was added followed by Portugal and Spain in 1986 then followed by Austria, Finland, Sweden in 1995 Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia in 2004 and most recently Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 swiftly following suit.</p><p>To join the EU a country must comply with the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 Copenhagen European Council. This requires a stable democracy that tolerates human rights and accommodates a functioning market economy capable of competition within the EU and of course the agrees to its reasonability of membership, Evaluation of a country’s fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council</p><p>Previously morocco attempted to join the EU but was the declined on the basis that is was not considered a European country.</p><p>Currently the country of Croatia is acceding membership while Albania is listed as a waiting applicant with Iceland, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey all being listed as viable applicants and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo as potential applicants.</p><p><strong>Critical Analysis</strong></p><p>In my opinion as an outsider the creation the EU has brought about a greater quality of life for the continent of Europe allowing it to secure itself as one of the world leading super powers it is unique in its transnational nature and provides reassurance and equality to all its member states allowing for the strengths and cultures of its various members to be pooled. However it is not without is potential downsides with questioning of the arguably non sensical application of morocco Britainâ€™s membership being a mere Trojan horse for American occupation and initial criticism of the founding 6 states the question can be raised of the EU can it be abused? Can it be seen as a popularity contest with unfair judgements being made on the basis of length of membership or size of economy as well as more specialised issues such as members who may have previously been in conflict with each other whether that conflict be based on economy living ideals ect given that countries are still competing with the EU at a global scale this can be flipped so it must also be raised are certain members holding the EU back? With concept of its strength being based on incretion of members it must also be asked are all member states pulling their weight or are they simply tagging along with the super power? However in the interest of equality global positioning and EU main advantage (its potential exponential growth in comparison to America or china) all applicants are considered through the copenhagen criteria. Other potential issues are its lack of single acting military force of its own instead relying on its members own military this seems as though it could potentially lead to narrow or somewhat “selfish” agendas from various states. Another Strength of the euro is the euro currency which has allowed on a base level a simplified more efficient approach to international bartering both on personal and global economic level.</p><p>States such as the United Kingdom are pushing the idea that those countries outside the single currency should always be able to block decisions that could affect all EU member states, not wanting to be involved in Eurozone itself but wanting to remain part of the union. These kinds of stipulations regarding specific countries could also potentially lead to conflict. However are may be necessary for many specific reasons that country may feel serve it best. this leads me to the thought that a world stage board such as the EU may not despite all its knowledge be able to fully understand and appreciate some of the finer more specific points of an individualâ€™s countries legislative nor would these finer matters be its priority leading to the potential the many issues may go unsolved at the world stage or within a member state.</p><p>in terms of its policy on migration which allows for all EU citizens to move more freely between member states the initial idea seems to go hand in hand with that of the euro accommodating those who wish to immigrate travel for leisure and helps stimulate trading however this has been criticized for causing a taxing amount of refugees and asylum seekers for other countries sometimes leading to the abusing of certain benefit policies of to escape justice it has also been pointed out to sometimes cause a brain drain whereby a large number of a countries skilled or specialist workers leave there respected countries the issue of countries within the EU maintaining their national and cultural identity has also been raised with many fearing it will cause a homogenized culture killing effect.</p><p>In my opinion, it seems apparent that the pros of a united Europe outweigh the downsides which are mostly based on theory and conjecture anyway it has become an increasingly appealing almost necessary step for any European country to conform to joining in the EU I would argue it is a highly successful concept that has quite possibly the greatest potential any of the worldâ€™s leading powers has ever had.</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union</p><p>http://www.europeword.com/blog/europe/european-union-pros-and-cons/</p><p>http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080131091813AAP47Q5</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union</p><p> </p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>CPTED and Broken Windows policing are both successful strategies for reclaiming crime-ridden public spaces (i.e., crime hot spots) by reducing crime opportunities and changing the public’s perceptions of what are acceptable behaviors in those specific areas. The Broken Windows theory is a policing strategy based on the basic principles, which holds that ignoring the little problems such as graffiti, loitering, houses and building with broken windows tend to add up and typically end up destroying a neighborhood good social life. The term Broken Windows come from the term used in 1982 article in The Atlantic Monthly by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. Broken Window s theories, propose that in addition to ignoring minor crimes and the minor sings of disorder the results will be additional disorder and ultimately lead to serious crimes to be committed.</p><p>In additional program capable of altering the safety and live hood of a community is one that requires the physical environment to be altered. Before one considers implementing Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED), a working definition and basic understanding is essential. The CPTED is a very broad study and it entails a re-design of hot zone environments to encourage desirable behavior, and functionality, and decreased antisocial (criminal) behavior. Although the CPTED field is gradually expanding to encompass affective, psychological, and sociological environmental design-known as the second-generation CPTED, its traditional focus has still been emphasized on altering the environment through effective physical design.</p><p>The Broken Windows theory created a positive environment were people who feared becoming crime victims would no longer want to abandon their communities. Instead it promoted community members to stay active in programs focused on prevention and reduction of criminal activity. In addition Broken Window policies sparked a revolutionary change in policing. In trouble neighborhoods were home foreclosures were the highest, the police worked with the community to improve the foreclosed homes physical appearance in turn improving the appearance of the community. If a window was broken the owner had to immediately replace it, if an owner was not found then the community replaced the broken windows. If the front yarn needed maintenance once again the owner was contacted if the owner could not be contacted the community would set up volunteer to help clean the yard. If there was graffiti on the walls they would immediately get painted over or scrubbed, then establish tough zero tolerance policy to deal with graffiti artist. If there were abandoned cars then immediately haul them out.</p><p>The “Broken Windows” theory can be applied to almost every other city or county where one resides. There is always that one part of a city where it’s known to fit into this theory. For example in some phoenix neighborhood that had drinking bars and liquor stores, customers were not allowed to drink outside. The business in collaboration with local police would make sure that there wouldn’t be any homeless and drunks on the sidewalls. The residents would also establish community programs to help the homeless and individual dealing with alcoholism.</p><p>Another example would apply to the growing problems the Buckeye police had to deal with, due to the high rates of foreclosed homes. The “Broken Windows” theory has implied that crime is more likely to occur in areas that are abandoned and not well taken care of. “Broken Windows” theory as explained by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in 1982 (Peak and Glensor 99), they describe how not only “physical signs that an area is unattended” is where crime will more likely take place, but also the type of “public” it is attracting to those areas. When home owners abandon their homes, criminals would tend to hide or be out of the public’s sight on foreclosed homes. The homes are also a loitered and frequented by drug users. Foreclosed homes will then tend to become “hanging out spots” for the local youths. The abandoned homes will then tend to get vandalized and have possible property damaged. Eventually these homes will deter potentially home buyers. However, Broken Windows Policing is not an answer to eradicate all crime, instead policies are intended to be proactive and preventive in working with the community and the local police to prevent and deter crime.</p><p>Adequate implementation of broken windows policies and the ability to carry out Crime Prevention thorough Environmental Design resourcefully, play the most important role in removing un-wanted targets that may lead to opportunities for offences to be committed, such as larceny, auto theft, home burglary and many white collar crimes. When you’re able to carry out broken windows policies and prevention through the effective implementation of the CPTED then the community would be and will remain crime free.</p><p>Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) is different from other crime control approaches that attempt to change the disposition or surrounding factors the offenders. Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) policies do not deal with the crime or the criminal activity directly. Instead, situational Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) theories are based on changing the individual’s environment. Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) prevention also targets potential victims by changing their interaction with their environment , with an end goal of positively changing the victims behavior .Effecting an environment is a way to reduce the likelihood of individuals of becoming crime victims as a cause of their environment conditions (wrong place at the wrong time). Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) will also tend to target public building designs that will target women and children for immediate situational crime intervention, since they will have higher chances of victimization.</p><p>Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) ignores the individual, instead if focuses on the individuals’ interaction with its immediate social, psychological and physical environment. The theoretical stance in s Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED), has a great deal in com­mon with social learning theory (R.V.G. Clarke 1982), determines a productive interaction between the individual and the environmental scenarios. To prevent and to reduce crime the individual’s interaction with their environment must be analyzed. Architects emphasise that to reducing delinquency in high schools “it is just as plausible to locate the causes of delinquency in the individual as in the environment (1980: Newman) “.Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) policies have enable the reduction of crime though environmental design by deterring low-rate offenders form being able to coming any crime, in addition (CPTED) policies are geared to identify and eliminate high-rate crime zone (such as alley ways, dark hallways and dead ends) to directly deter offenders. Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) offers effective design measures for the community and will most likely change the criminal to be perception of committing a crime in that particular neighbourhood.</p><p>In an attempt to change the disposition or personality of hot zone environment ffor example,” the introduction of technology which enabled telephones to display the calling number on a potential victim’s phone served to reduce the number of obscene phone calls (Clarke, 1991)”. Immediate physical changes on an environment, such as security visible cameras and constant recordings on videotape or DVD’s on hot zones (such as liquor stores, alley ways, dark hallways and dead ends), will not only aid the police in convicting criminals but the camera’s presence can also reduce the risk of personal items from being stolen and private property from being vandalized. For example in High School with dozens of unsecured and poorly labeled exterior(emergency) doors will not able to effectively control who comes and goes thought the doors. Intruders will have no restrictions and are free rein; as a result schools officials must rely on other security measures. Without the existence of a natural access control, school security officials much place a greater emphasis must on surveillance, territoriality, school social climate, and relying on security personnel to step in and compensate thus by changing the method on which unsecured doors are monitored the safety of the school’s students have been increased .</p><p>A similar argu­ment concerning the negative aesthetics of an environment such as loud guard dogs, barbed wire and security cameras will deter any criminal activity from occurring. Policies through Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) will have an effect of changing the (criminals) individual’s perception of a good target area prone to commit a crime; effective environmental designs will act a positive crime deterrent. To effectively maintain a crime free environment , governing bodies along with community planes must be required to approve effective planning policies but must also to effectively consult and address a communities social and criminal problems. Sometimes by just implementing slight aesthetic changes will imply that a criminal should be frustrated by CPTED measures being enforce. Adding lights to hot spots will additionally effect the deception of easy crime, (quick cash, etc.) and will also change a criminal’s decision, as to the time; location and type of crime to be committed. The extend, under which these Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) policies get applied with immediately effect the motivation of the perpetuator and effectively deterring the opportunistic offender will be determined by its environmental designs. , both of these strategies CPTED and Broken Windows have the effect of increasing residents’ willingness to apply informal social control in an area</p><p>These policing methods, Broken Windows Policing, Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) strategies require a substantial amount of trust on the police officer’s part as well as an active commitment/participation for the citizen’s part. Both of these methods of policing allow citizens to collaborate with community leaders, architects, social workers, designers and police agencies and develop environments that are not just esthetically pleasant but offer its inhabitants a guaranteed sense of safety and thrust. All participants will have to trust each other and know that each other is looking out for them to help everyone stay safe… By understand how situational crime prevention is different from other crime control approaches by being able to bring together the policies and theories incorpo­rated in rational choice theory and routine activity .Tends to lead to an increased focus on the relationship between certain environments and types of crime. We understand why certain locations usually generate more crime, or whether they just provide a suitable environment in which crime just happens to occur. The environment does not so cause crime as merely provide an appropriate setting for it to occur­.</p><p>It very important to understand broken windows theories and Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED), perspectives within certain environments are more likely to encourage criminal activity and focus in positive environments are less likely to do so. CPTED and Broken Windows policing are both strategies for reclaiming crime-ridden public spaces (i.e., crime hot spots) by reducing crime opportunities and changing the public’s perceptions of what are acceptable behaviors in those areas. Broken windows theories and Crime Prevention Thorough Environmental Design (CPTED) promote the quality of life and sustainable living environments through enhanced community safety.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Between 1968 and 1985, in Florence Italy, eight couples were killed in violent acts that included multiple gunshots, stabbings and female genital mutilation. The perpetrator of these vicious crimes, dubbed ‘The Monster of Florence,’ has never been caught. Despite the violence of the crimes, the killer left no physical evidence at the crime scenes to connect himself to them. However, he did leave the makings of a psychological profile, the details of which are presented here using the five stages of criminal profiling offered by Pinizzotto and Finkel (1990):  a study of the criminal act and the types of people who have committed similar offences; an analysis of the crime scene(s); an examination of the background and activities of the victim(s); a formulation of the probable motivating factors of the suspect; and, a description of the perpetrator based upon the person’s probable psychological make-up. Throughout this profile, The Monster of Florence will be referred to as either the ‘monster’ or the ‘perpetrator.’</p><p><strong>The Criminal Act: Who commits Serial Murders?</strong></p><p>Most serial offenders are classified as organized or disorganized (Muller, 2000). While disorganized offenders are more opportunistic in their approach, organized offenders are intelligent and careful planners (Muller, 2000). The Monster of Florence was clearly an organized serial killer, as his crime scenes were carefully selected for their privacy and great effort was made to leave no evidence behind, with the exception of bullets. This suggests the perpetrator had a higher than average IQ (Palermo, 2002).</p><p>Most serial killers have had a dysfunctional past and are likely to have been negatively affected during adolescence. In particular, many serial killers have insecure attachments to their parents/caretakers and have ‘unusual relationships with their mothers’ (LaBrode, 2007). In this case, the perpetrators clear hate of women could be indicative of a strained relationship with his mother.</p><p>Serial killers also tend to have low self-esteem, which appears to be the case with the Monster of Florence, who surprises his victims and shoots them point blank. This suggests he may not feel able to handle victims who are conscious of his presence. Lack of self-esteem and confidence is also reflected in the fact that he is not able to handle stressful situations, such as escape attempts. In the Mainardi case, after the male victim tried to escape, the perpetrator even decided to forego his ritualistic mutilations. Serial offenders often subscribe to a very specific ‘modus operandi’ or MO, which consists of a series of behaviours completed by the offender to successfully perpetrate the crime without being caught (Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004). In this case, the perpetrator took great efforts to ensure no evidence would lead back to him. Indeed, no fingerprints were ever found.</p><p>Serial offenders often escalate their MO over successive crimes, with the evolution and complexity of the MO often being dependent on an offender’s intelligence level, experience and motivation (Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004). In this case, the murders became increasingly gruesome, including excessive stab wounds, posing of the body postmortem, genital mutilation, and removal of body parts.</p><p><strong>Case Linkage</strong></p><p>There are a number of factors within various crime scenes that aid in linking one case to other cases suspected to be serial in nature. These factors include the state of the crime scene, the MO, ritualistic behaviours, and the criminal’s signature (Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004).</p><p>The Crime Scene (Appendix 1): The location a criminal chooses and the state of the crime scene can have great significance when creating an offenders psychological profile (Muller, 2000). For example, organized offenders choose locations before the execution of the crime so that they can carry out their signature processes without interruption (Keppel, 2000). In the Monster case, the perpetrator chose isolated, rural locations in which to carry out his crimes. All locations except the Mainardi/Migliorini crime scene were away from busy roads that afforded privacy. Even when the female victims were moved, the new locations were close to the original crime scene – partially hidden, but not hard to find.</p><p>As indicated in the name, all of the crime scenes were in and around Florence, indicating that the perpetrator lived or worked in the area, was extremely familiar with the area and was able to closely monitor these locations (Snook et al., 2005). Also, other than the bullets left at every crime scene being matched to the same missing gun, the perpetrator left no other evidence. This could point to the perpetrator’s organized personality as well as possible prior knowledge of police procedures.</p><p>The Modus Operandi (MO): The MO in this case evolved as time progressed. Eight couples were murdered over the course of seventeen years. The crimes were almost always committed on Saturdays, in the evening hours, and often on cloudy nights. This might have been the perpetrator’s effort to decrease the chances of being observed or recognized. The weapons of choice were a .22 caliber gun and single edge blade. The gun was used to initially kill/disable the victims and the blade was used mostly on the female victims. The first double murder (Locci/LoBianco) only involved gunshots, but progressive murders became increasingly gruesome, including excessive stab wounds (Pettini/Gentilcore), posing of the body postmortem (Nuccio/Foggi), genital mutilation (Pettini/Gentilcore; Nuccio/Foggi; Cambi/Baldi), and removal of body parts (Vicchi di Mugello; Kraveichuili/Mauriot).</p><p>An MO should not be held too rigidly by investigators as it can change slightly as the context of the crime changes and the offender adapts to changing circumstances (Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004). For example, external factors such as the unavailability of victims or a busy crime location can change the MO. This was evidenced in the Cambi/Baldi murder in which female genitalia were removed, but the action was so crude that the abdominal wall was exposed. This could be attributed to a relatively busy crime scene, as there were at least two couples that possibly witnessed the offender fleeing.</p><p>Rituals and Signature: Rituals are distinct from MOs in that they are symbolic and reflect the motives and fantasy behind crimes (Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004). In this case, the perpetrator initiated and continued genital mutilation on female victims, starting with the Pettini/Gentilcore murders, unless external factors prevented him from doing so. For example, the Meyer/Sens murders were a case of mistaken identity and, in the absence of a female victim, there was no genital mutilation. The posing of the female victims’ postmortem is also a significant ritualistic element of these crimes, with most female victims (except in the case of Locci/LoBianco and Mainardi/Migliorini), being posed spread-eagle and away from the male victim. The passage of time can also change the rituals of the crime as the offender refines his skills and gains a more elaborate view of his motivations for the crime (Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004). For example, it wasn’t until the last two crimes that the perpetrator started cutting out the female victim’s breast.</p><p>The signature of an offender comprises a unique combination of behaviours and rituals that make their crimes unique and attributable to them specifically (Hazelwood &amp; Warren, 2004). In this case, the perpetrator surprised couples in isolated locations, usually those engaging in romantic encounters. The male was quickly disposed of with gunshots and while the female was also shot, they were then usually moved from the crime scene, unless the crime scene itself afforded privacy (like the tent in the Kraveichvili/Mauriot murder). The female was always separated from the male victim.</p><div class="card border-0 my-3 bg-light" data-track="In-Content Banner 2"><div class="card-body text-center"></div></div><p>The profile of the victims is integral to building a psychological profile of a serial killer since such criminals often select victims who have characteristics that are somehow important to them (LaBrode, 2007). Victim information such as age, social circumstances and gender, can contribute to the psychological profile of the perpetrator (Palermo, 2002). In the Monster case, all the victims were couples taking part in romantic liaisons. Almost all the couples were out alone in isolated, rural areas. All couples, with the exception of one, were heterosexual. All had reportedly spent their last night at a discotheque. While the perpetrator’s victims were as young as eighteen, age seemed to be of no importance when choosing his victims. All male victims were shot to death, resulting in a quick death. Risk factors that made these victims vulnerable to the perpetrator were that they were romantically involved, alone, in an isolated location, and they were paying little attention to their surroundings.</p><p><strong>Motivating Factors</strong></p><p>Since serial killings are primarily motivated by psychological factors, it can be difficult to accurately identify individual motivating factors until the perpetrator is captured. It is possible, however, to speculate on the motivation based on the crime scene information. In this case, the choice of victim (i.e. couples) is clearly a conscious choice. While the perpetrator killed both individuals, the male was killed quickly while the woman was mutilated and stabbed. This could indicate a sexual component to the killings, in which case, the death of both the male and female is imminent, but the victim of choice appears to be the female (Arndt et al., 2005). The mutilations and overkill also indicate that the perpetrator might be sexually incapable or might have experience of being rejected by women, hence his apparent anger towards this gender.</p><p>The victims of crimes are often a vehicle used by criminals to achieve their ’emotional goals’ (Woodworth &amp; Potter, 1999). In this case, the couples may be symbolic of a need the perpetrator feels unable to fulfill (i.e. to form relationships). As ‘vehicles’ for emotional goals, victims were subjected to intense violence and brutality, which might have been a means of the perpetrator destroying what he could not achieve – a relationship.</p><p>The perpetrator’s allocation of greater time spent on the female victim indicates his level of anger or even rage, directed at women. The removal of genitalia further illustrates this rage. Conversely, the mutilation and removal of the genitalia could indicate that the perpetrator had not only symbolically attacked the women’s femininity but could also be trying to destroy signs of any abuse (Arndt et al, 2005). Interestingly, the remains of the removed body parts were never found, so it may be that the perpetrator took them as trophies.</p><p>After the Kraveichvili/Mauriot murders, spent bullets similar to those found at the crime scene were found near a hospital. This location proximity might, therefore, indicate that the perpetrator could be a medical professional. This is especially relevant in light of the fact that it appears both gloves and surgical skill would have been required, especially with the absence of fingerprint evidence, and the removal of the body parts</p><p><strong>Offender Profile</strong></p><p>“Deductive profiling” is a type of psychological profiling based on the evidence collected from the crime scene, including the type of victim and the type of crime committed (Strano, 2004). In addition to the crime scene evidence, profilers also consider the homicide style, the motivation behind the crime, the risk status of the victim(s), the time taken to commit the crime, and how risky the perpetration of the crime was (Muller, 2000). Once this evidence is examined, an offender profile or ‘working hypothesis’ can be formed to help narrow down the field of individuals who could have committed the crimes (Strano, 2004).</p><p>In this case, the profile indicates that the perpetrator is male and lives or works in Florence. The organized execution of the crimes and lack of evidence indicates that the perpetrator was highly intelligent. The perpetrator might also be a loner, since scouting and observing remote locations requires time and freedom from others. The fact that the perpetrator surprises his victims and shoots them at point blank range indicates a lack of self-esteem; he may not feel able to handle victims who are sufficiently aware of his presence. Lack of self-esteem and confidence is also reflected in the fact that he is not able to handle stressful situations, such as a victim escape. Indeed, the number of bullets used by the killer to kill his victims was more than necessary, thereby eliminating the chance of an escape. Also, in the Mainardi case, after the male victim tried to escape, he was repeatedly shot. In this case the killer even decided to let go of his ritualistic mutilation in the crime, possibly indicating that the near escape had been too much for him.</p><p>Most serial crimes comprising a sexual element, as in this case, are about power over the victim (Keppel, 2000). Since the motives of serial killings tend to be specific to the killer, it is likely that the perpetrator has a history of negative experiences with females, possibly in terms of unsuccessful sexual relations.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Although psychological profiling is still in its infancy, primarily because the science behind it lacks research, in combination with personal instinct it can be used to provide further insight into the mind of the criminal. In the case of the Monster of Florence, despite little physical evidence being left at the crime scenes, the clear similarities across crimes provides enough information to develop a psychological profile that might help investigators identify the perpetrator.</p><p> </p></div></div>

These basic documents include the Penal Code, first promulgated in 1860 as the Indian Penal Code; the Police Act of 1861; the Evidence Act of 1872; the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1898; the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908; and the Official Secrets Act of 1911.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Main Content:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Classification of crime:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The major classes of crimes are listed in the Penal Code, the country’s most important and comprehensive penal statute. Among the listed categories of more serious crimes are activities called “offenses against the state.” The Penal Code authorizes the government to prosecute any person or group of persons conspiring or abetting in a conspiracy to overthrow the government by force. An offense of this nature is also defined as “war against the state.” Whether or not an offense constitutes a conspiracy is determined by the “intent” of the participant, rather than by the number of the participants involved, so as to distinguish it from a riot or any other form of disturbance not regarded as antinational. Section 121 of the Penal Code makes antinational offenses punishable by death or imprisonment for twenty years. The incitement of hatred, contempt, or disaffection</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">toward a lawfully constituted authority is also a criminal offense punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Among other categories of felonies are offenses against the public tranquility (meaning unlawful assembly), rioting, and public disturbances; offenses relating to religion; and offenses against property, such as theft, robbery, and dacoity (robbery by a group of five or more persons).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consequences of committing a crime:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Punishment is divided into five categories: death; banishment, ranging from seven years to life; imprisonment; forfeiture of property; and fines. The imprisonment may be “simple” or “rigorous” (hard labor), ranging from the minimum of twenty-four hours for drunken or disorderly conduct to a maximum of fourteen years at hard labor for more serious offenses. Juvenile offenders may be sentenced to detention in reform schools for a period of three to seven years. For minor infractions whipping, not exceeding fifteen lashes, may be prescribed as an alternative to detention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Preventive detention may be ordered under the amended Security of Pakistan Act of 1952 and under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when, in the opinion of the authorities, there is a strong likelihood of public disorder. Bangladeshi regimes have made extensive use of this provision. Similarly, Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, frequently invoked by magistrates for periods up to two months, prohibits assembly of five or more persons, holding of public meetings, and carrying of firearms. In addition, the Disturbed Areas (Special Powers) Ordinance of 1962 empowers a magistrate or an officer in charge of a police contingent to open fire or use force against</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">any persons breaching the peace in the disturbed areas and to arrest and search without a warrant. The assembly of five or more persons and the carrying of firearms may also be prohibited under this ordinance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The custody and correction of persons sentenced to imprisonment is regulated under the Penal Code of 1860, the Prisons Act of 1894, and the Prisoners Act of 1900, as amended. The prison system has expanded but in 1988 was basically little changed from the later days of the British Raj. The highest jail administration official is the inspector general of prisons or, if this office is not separately assigned, the inspector general of police. At the division level or the police range level, the senior official is called director of prisons; at the district level, he is the jail superintendent. Below the district jail level are the subdistrict and village police lockups. Dhaka Central Jail is the largest and most secure prison and has more extensive facilities than those at the successive lower echelons. All installations are staffed by prison police usually permanently assigned to this duty. In general, prisons and jails have low standards of hygiene and sanitation and are seriously overcrowded. Rehabilitation programs with trained social workers were rudimentary or nonexistent through the late 1980s. Overcrowding–the most serious basic problem–was likely to worsen as the 1990s approached because of the mounting number of arrests connected with opposition campaigns to oust Ershad from office.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the justice could not be served in a proper manner, hence miscarriage of justice. A miscarriage of justice primarily is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction" title="Conviction">conviction</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment" title="Punishment">punishment</a> of a person for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime" title="Crime">crime</a> they did not commit. The term can also apply to errors in the other</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">direction—”<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_of_impunity" title="Errors of impunity">errors of impunity</a>“, and to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_case" title="Civil case">civil case</a>. Most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice_system" title="Criminal justice system">criminal justice systems</a> have some means to overturn, or “quash”, a wrongful conviction, but this is often difficult to achieve. The most serious instances occur when a wrongful conviction is not overturned for several years, or until after the innocent person has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executed" title="Executed">executed</a> or died in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jail" title="Jail">jail</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Miscarriage of justice” is sometimes synonymous with wrongful conviction, referring to a conviction reached in an unfair or disputed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_%28law%29" title="Trial (law)">trial</a>. Wrongful convictions are frequently cited by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment" title="Capital punishment">death penalty</a> opponents as cause to eliminate death penalties to avoid executing innocent persons. In recent years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fingerprinting" title="Genetic fingerprinting">DNA evidence</a> has been used to clear many people falsely convicted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_language" title="Scandinavian language">Scandinavian languages</a> have a word, the Norwegian variant of which is <em>justismord</em>, which literally translates as “justice murder.” The term exists in several languages and was originally used for cases where the accused was convicted, executed, and later cleared after death. With capital punishment decreasing, the expression has acquired an extended meaning, namely any conviction for a crime not committed by the convicted. The retention of the term “murder” represents both universal abhorrence against wrongful convictions and awareness of how destructive wrongful convictions are.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the term travesty of justice is sometimes used for a gross, deliberate miscarriage of justice. The usage of the term in a specific case is, however, inherently biased due to different opinions about the case. The concept of miscarriage of justice has important implications for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_review" title="Standard of review">standard of review</a>, in that an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court" title="Appellate court">appellate court</a> will often only exercise its discretion to correct plain error when a miscarriage of justice (or “manifest injustice”) would otherwise occur.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladesh, for instance, national daily newspaper, The <em>Prothom Alo</em>, reported on 13 March 2008 that a court convicted three persons to rigorous imprisonment for life, which means 14 years in jail, for an alleged charge of kidnapping of a girl in Jhalakathi district where, in fact, the said crime did not take place. The girl herself fled herself from her maternal home as result of being tortured by her aunt and uncle.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cases of miscarriage of justice in British context:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> a jailed person whose conviction is quashed may be paid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages" title="Damages">compensation</a> for the time they were incarcerated. This is currently limited by statute to a maximum sum of £500,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Until 2005, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole" title="Parole">parole</a> system assumed all convicted persons were guilty, and poorly handled those who were not. To be paroled, a convicted person had to sign a document in which, among other things, they confessed to the crime for which they were convicted. Someone who refused to sign this declaration spent longer in jail than someone who signed it. Some wrongly convicted people, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Six" title="Birmingham Six">Birmingham Six</a>, were refused parole for this reason. In 2005 the system changed, and began to parole prisoners who never admitted guilt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">English law has no official means of correcting a “perverse” verdict (conviction of a defendant on the basis of insufficient evidence). Appeals are based exclusively on new evidence or errors by the judge or prosecution (but not the defense), or jury irregularities. A reversal occurred, however, in the 1930s when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herbert_Wallace" title="William Herbert Wallace">William Herbert Wallace</a> was</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">exonerated of the murder of his wife. There is no right to a trial <em>without</em> jury (except during the troubles in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> when a judge or judges presided without a jury).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the early 1990s, a series of high-profile cases turned out to be miscarriages of justice. Many resulted from police fabricating evidence to convict people they thought were guilty, or simply to get a high conviction rate. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_Serious_Crime_Squad" title="West Midlands Serious Crime Squad">West Midlands Serious Crime Squad</a> became notorious for such practices, and was disbanded in 1989. In 1997 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Cases_Review_Commission" title="Criminal Cases Review Commission">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a> was established specifically to examine possible miscarriages of justice. However, it still requires either strong new evidence of innocence, or new proof of a legal error by the judge or prosecution. For example, merely insisting you are innocent and the jury made an error, or stating there was not enough evidence to prove guilt, is not enough. It is not possible to question the jury’s decision or query on what matters it was based. The waiting list for cases to be considered for review is at least two years on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There are certain reasons why such miscarriage of justice has occurred:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, it could be the manner in which confessions are taken. The police authority must not oppress or pressure the witness or the suspect in such way that they may give wrong confessions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, some commentators have pointed out that the flawed forensic reports may have played an important role in miscarriage of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thirdly, the prosecution at times may not disclose certain evidence that may favour the opponent party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, the procedures after the trials are slow and cumbersome which may also lead to miscarriage of justice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It can be said that the judiciary plays an active part in the lives of citizens and they look forward to seek justice from them. So, if the judiciary does not provide proper justice then it is unfortunate that citizens would lose their credibility. In order to avoid such miscarriage of justice, there must be an efficient system where justice will be done not denied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bibliography:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Retrieved from <a href="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a> on Oct  10<sup>th</sup>, 2010 at 10.15am</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Retrieved from www.

9254	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">The culmination of Independence of Judiciary in Bangladesh</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The culmination of Independence of Judiciary in Bangladesh</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh is one of largest democracy country in the world. Although Bangladesh judiciary system is fully independent but it is true that still the judiciary system of Bangladesh is directly or indirectly effected by politically, especially when the time of recruitment of High Court Judges. For this Bangladesh cannot be benefit by the Independence judicial system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>History of Bangladesh Judiciary: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The present legal and judicial system of Bangladesh owes its origin mainly to two hundred years British rule in the Indian Sub-Continent although some elements of it are remnants of Pre-British period tracing back to Hindu and Muslim administration. It passed through various stages and has been gradually developed as a continuous historical process. The process of evolution has been partly indigenous and partly foreign and the legal system of the present day emanates from a mixed system which has structure, legal principles and concepts modeled on both Indo-Mughal and English law. The Indian sub-continent has a known history of over five hundred years with Hindu and Muslim periods which proceeded the British period, and each of these early periods had a distinctive legal system of its own.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In classless dos, the nation rests on trinity individual organs, videlicet the executive, the legislature and the organization. The organization of Bangladesh vests the head cognition in the executive and the legislative powerfulness in parliament. Though there is no particular vesting of critical power, it is vested in the scheme; the organization comprises all courts and tribunals,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Which performs the breakable extend of ensuring rule of law in the guild. A interpersonal system remains seamless and cohesive with the aid of a undamaged juridical grouping. Organization redresses the grievances of the group and resolves disputes. The dysfunction of governance impacts writer gravely than that of any remaining organization as it removes from the handle of group of combining with the elite. In Bangladesh he Juridical norms and pattern someone been derogating for life. Latterly a wares of allegations hit mounted surrounding governance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Separation of the Judiciary</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Distance of the administration has been argued both as a effort and a tutelary of ceremonious righteousness city (Hadley, 2004). The construct of separation of the governance from the executive refers to a situation in which the juridical separate of governance acts as its own embody frees from engagement and influences from the separate branches of governance especially the chief. Influence may initiate in the construction of the government scheme where parts or all of the administration are coeducational into added body (in the happening of Bangladesh: the executive). For monition, in Bangladesh the chairperson in interview with the Dominant Hotel according to the property, appoints juridical officers additional circumstances permit utilitarian aspects of the juridical group when the management of magistrate is in several way, impressed by executive orders or actions .Head assault of this organic inflict lead in slanted soul of judges, and another officers of the juridical cadre, favoring individuals who argue the governance semi political lot. Dr. Kamal Husain, a reputable lawyer of the Supreme Grounds, explains the idea of modification of the scheme through the thought of backup standards</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Head mariner follows plans, which are of a upended nature, with the higher offices guiding the decisions of the displace officers, who perception for the top feasible distance to boost the plans recognized by those higher in the pecking request. Executive decisions are made in lines of contract; law is not insurance. Judges or magistrates performing righteousness functions must investigate what inform is given and attain a way to physiologist apply it to the law; there is inferior gathering for an individual’s perceptions in critical decisions (Dr. Kamal, 2004; 5 March).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Comprehensive cessation is relatively unheard or unlikely of theory, content no administration is completely cut from the administrative and legislative bodies because this reduces the powerfulness of checks and balances and creates wasteful communication between meat of the propose (Hadley; 2004). A piercing point of breakup, however, can be a bear down protective of righteousness metropolis, as this report gift endeavor to judge. The beginning of Bangladesh is the firstly accumulation of judicial metropolis, presiding over all the “Republic’s affairs and framing the system and governance of the authorities. Time constitutive flows subsist, regarding change of the governance, there are competent nutrient for stiff juridical metropolis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The judicial independency of all juridical officers is independent according to the frigate of Bangladesh. This ideal is weatherproof primarily through the thought of breakup of the organization from the remaining organs of governing. Article 22 dos flat and definitely: The nation shall assure the surcease of the establishment from the chief meat of posit. Article 95(1) addressed the method of conclusion for the Supreme Court. Parting) and penalty of persons busy in the righteousness bringing and magistrate’s exertion critical functions shall tog in the Chairwoman and shall be exercised by him in consultation with the Supreme Court.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Justification: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Judiciary is a place confirmed on unity towards a neutral and fair judgment, their work defines the nation’s credibility to its people in pursuing a fair system of answering their questions and complaints filed in cases and grafts. Bangladesh Judiciary System cremated the usual or the natural circumstances and trials into a political showdown where lawyers fight for money and judges fight for a seat at the parliament. The intensity of being a government worker is that their service is always vial, with monstrosity running through their veins, helps them deal with corruption from every grass root level as the system is like a maze that corners every move and darkens the hope of being a place of justice rather becomes a fair for truth become lies and lies become something truth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After years of fierce debate and delays, the military-backed caretaker government formally announced the separation of the country’s subordinate judiciary from the executive on January 16, 2007. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Ordinance finally came into effect on November 1, 2007, a decision welcomed by civil society organizations and lawyers as the first step toward an independent judiciary. Under the new law, the Supreme Court appoints all lower court judges and judicial magistrates and holds them accountable for their actions, as opposed to appointment by the Ministry of Establishment, headed by the prime minister, which previously had given the executive branch political control over the lower courts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, direct and indirect political influence often makes it difficult for judges to make impartial, fair decisions based on the evidence and the law. The government’s decision to send two judges into retirement in accordance with Section 9(2) of the Public Servants (Retirement) Act of 1974 on July 30, 2009, was an example of the political use of existing laws to punish judges who are unwilling to listen to the executive. Despite the attempt to make the judiciary functionally independent, controversy surrounding the appointment of judges—especially the Chief Justice and other judges in the High Court, one of two divisions of the Supreme Court—continues to polarize the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consultation with the prime minister continues to be politicized. The lack of clarity of Article 95 of the constitution, which entrusts the president with the power to appoint the chief justice (the most prestigious position in the country’s judicial system) but falls short of explaining the consultation process for the appointment, leaves plenty of room for political maneuvering.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the practices of the past, the AL government quickly replaced the entire group of public prosecutors with members or genuine supporters of the governing party, who allegedly devote much of their time to the protection and promotion of partisan political interests. According to a report published by the Asian Human Rights Commission, the political appointment of public prosecutors often ensures ?that the judicial process serves the interest of the government as much as possible and perverts the course of justice. A national household survey conducted between June 2009 and May 2010 identified the judiciary as the most corrupt service sector in the country. Corruption is pervasive throughout the judiciary, including in the High Court. Some 88 percent of people who turned to the judicial system became the victim of widespread corruption. Corruption and partisan politics are two of the main reasons why people are often denied access to justice, as they do not have access to independent counsel and fair trials.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Recommendation: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Political disturbance is an outstanding impediment to the proper adjudicator. If the organization is separated, cases can be dealt without governmental disturbance. We cannot await comely administration if judiciary does not run independently. There is just a soft possible ness for individual to be unfair in case of commutative scheme.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Improvements in respect medication must be prefab at both the some one and the Region levels. Administrative reorganization is essential at this abstraction in visit to put in set the structures head. At the some body train, the Registrar’s Duty in the Supreme Respect present be studied and reorganized along useful lines, i.e. individual management, and financial direction, unspecialized body, hominid resources, and search. Institutions such as the existing Juridical Council give be deliberate and opposite administrative reorganizations may be advisable and implemented.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the government has sought, and the Proceedings Separation has granted, <a name="_GoBack"></a>classify of extensions in period for the feat of the Supreme Court’s directives. Formally acres officially the governing is sworn to implementing these directives, which would also permit many changes in the outlaw procedural laws. Yet these repeated spreading imply continuing challenges to the simple feat of Lincoln of Rajshahi, Rajshahi the directives (ADB, 2004). It is strongly matte everywhere that direct steps are condemned for separation of the organization from the administrator periodical of the verbalize (Rahman, 2004)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Reference:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.

In civil law systems, personal property is often called <b>movable property</b> or <b>movables</b> – any property that can be moved from one location to another.</p><p>Personal property can be understood in comparison to real estate, immovable property or real property (such as land and buildings).</p><p>Movable property on land (larger livestock, for example) was not automatically sold with the land, it was “personal” to the owner and moved with the owner.</p><p>The word <i>cattle</i> is the Old Norman variant of Old French <i>chatel</i>, chattel (derived from Latin <i>capitalis</i>, “of the head”), which was once synonymous with general movable personal property.</p><p><em>What is considered movable property?</em><br/>When dealing with the sale of your property or purchase of a house, movable property can be described as the seller’s personal property which is not affixed to the property, for example curtains which do not automatically form part of the sale agreement.</p><p><em>What are the characteristics of immovable property?</em><br/>Immovable property can be described as the land and all buildings on the land as well as all permanent fixtures which are included in the sale of the property. These are items which are glued, cemented or bolted to the property.</p><p>The simplest way to determine if an item is a permanent fixture would be to imagine turning the house upside down. The items that would fall down can be seen as movable and those that would remain attached can be seen as part of the immovable property; better known as fixtures in the offer to purchase.</p><p><strong>Ownership of movable vs immovable property</strong></p><p>The ownership and transfer of immovable property is regulated by the Deeds Registries Act and the Sectional Titles Act, while movable property will be dealt with in terms of our common law.</p><p>Sale agreements can include a list of fixtures which may be included or excluded in the agreement of sale. This list will provide clarity on who will be the owner of each item of property after transfer has taken place. Items such as blinds, floating shelves and satellite dishes are typically classified as fixed items as they are bolted to the property, while items such as curtains and paintings are seen as movable items.</p><p>Parties can include certain movable property in the offer to purchase which will be taken over by the purchaser, or the parties can even enter into a separate agreement between themselves wherein the purchaser purchases specific moveable items from the seller.</p><p>It is important for both the seller and purchaser to understand what is included and what is excluded in the agreement of sale as uncertainty can lead to negative consequences, even litigation.</p><p>Certain items may be viewed as fixed by the buyer while the seller sees them as his or her personal items. To avoid this, both the seller and purchaser should request that a detailed list is included in the sale agreement of any and all moveable items included in the purchase of the property.</p></div></div>

9260	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">THE DEMOCRATISATION OF GENDER AFTER THE SEXUAL OFFENCES ACT (1967) AND HOW IT AFFECTS QUEER STUDIES</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>E.M. Forster’s novel <em>Maurice</em>, written between 1913 and 1914, but not published after his death in 1970, is a seminal work providing a moving, personal portrayal of homosexuality and homophobia in 20<sup>th</sup>-century England. Exploration of its detailed accounts of attitudes about homosexuals and their various reactions to the discrimination they faced—for instance, denying their homosexuality and marrying; embracing their homosexuality, but discreetly; leaving the country for more open-minded cultures—serves as an excellent starting point for exploring the underlying cultural framework and values which will form the subject matter of this essay. Of no small note is that Forster, whose reputation as a literary genius, believed his own homosexuality too powerful a secret to come out, as it were, until after his death, in a way squandering his own social power and the potential to liberate both himself and other homosexuals.</p><p>Britain, origin of so much cultural and political vibrancy and of the democratic principles which are now held to be self-evident in modern Western nations, had a particularly difficult time ridding itself of a virulent and persistent form of discrimination: its stubbornly conservative refusal to accept homosexuality and homosexual behaviours into the cultural norm of its society. Indiscreet homosexuals in England of the 20<sup>th</sup> century could look forward to a life of bigotry and discrimination, to say nothing of financial and personal ruin and imprisonment, as homosexuality was still a criminal offence in England until 1967.</p><p>“The limits of the sexually acceptable are still there. Geographical location and economic status significantly affect how free individuals are to choose to be open about their sexual orientation. And some orientations are still problematic.”</p><p>As the above quotation suggests, the issue of homosexuality remains a divisive issue. This is in spite of forty years passing since the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Britain; forty years that have also witnessed the gay community (both males and females) move in from the margins of mainstream society in order to occupy more powerful positions of authority. This has been meted out in political office, in popular culture and in the global mass media. Yet, in spite of this, there remains – at the dawn of the twenty first century – a sense that homosexuality is a lifestyle that stands at odds to all that decent society holds dear. Even in the United Kingdom, probably the most secular country in the world, the moral aspect of homosexuality is never far from the surface of the debate over how gay people are supposed to integrate into a predominantly heterosexual sphere. This is the crux of the debate discussed herein.</p><p>For the purpose of perspective, the following essay must adopt an integrated approach, attempting to synthesise the theoretical and historiographical debates regarding the experiences of gay people in post war Britain. In this way, we can trace the social, political and legal evolution of the democratisation and liberalisation of sexuality and gender in the UK while at the same time offering a critique of the aims and achievements of the gay movement at this time. Furthermore, the continuities and changes of the homosexual landscape in post war Britain can be more accurately depicted amid the relevant academic literature of the times. A conclusion can then be sought that attempts to place the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 within its correct historical and theoretical context. First, however, a brief overview of this Act of Parliament must be ascertained so as to establish a conceptual framework for the remainder of the discussion.</p><p>The Sexual Offences Act that was passed by Westminster in 1967 was a landmark piece of legislation that sought to address the harsh legal inequalities between homosexual and heterosexual people with regards to their private lives and the way in which these private lives were dictated by the public and political sphere. The impetus behind the reform of laws pertaining to homosexuality in the United Kingdom came from the Wolfendon Report, which was commissioned in 1957 to highlight the essential differences between crime and sin. Essentially, while society and the manufacturing of cultural consensus may indeed have deemed homosexuality as a sin (or a sickness) to equate it with criminality was deemed in many circles to be anachronistic and blight against post war British civilisation and its values. This is an important point and one that ought to be borne in mind throughout the discussion: the 1967 Sexual Offences Act marked the first serious attempt at the legal decriminalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom since the Buggery Act of 1533 when the British state first sought to wrest the issue of gay coupling away from the ecclesiastical courts and into the legal courts of the realm. Viewed through this prism, the 1967 Sexual Offences Act can be seen to be a symptom of the broader civil rights movement of the 1960s which oversaw the criminalisation of inequality relating to gender, race, creed and religion in all of the major countries of the western hemisphere. The Act could not have come about without there first having been in place the existence of liberal youth culture that was able to use the tools available within a democratic state in order to lobby the political establishment for social and cultural reform.</p><p>Thus, although the Act itself has since been open to charges of hypocrisy (the result of the Act witnessed an increase rather than a decrease in the numbers of arrests of gay men for breaking the new law) and prejudice (the Act clearly and identifiably differentiates between homosexual and heterosexual people with regards to the ‘age of consent’ with twenty one being used for gay people in comparison to sixteen for straight people) it should nevertheless still be seen as an important milestone in the evolution of a more egalitarian British society. Certainly, in legal terms, 1967 must be seen as the starting point of any discussion with regards to the democratisation of homosexuality in post war Britain as before the advent of the Sexual Offences Act homosexual acts were seen as essentially criminal activities and therefore placed outside of the bounds of the rules, regulations and customs of decent, civilised society. Therefore, while mainstream culture and the political establishment may well have both publicly and privately continued to denounce homosexuality in all its forms as a sin (and preferred to keep homosexuality firmly outside of the realms of civilised society), the removal of the spectre of a criminal offence telegraphed a major turning point in the way in which gay people were viewed and treated in post war Britain. Furthermore, without the Act, the subsequent achievements of the gay movement in the UK would never have been able to begin to take place as the legal framework in which the gay movement lobbied for reform during the 1970s and 1980s would not have existed. Democratisation of sexuality in post war Britain thus begins in 1967.</p><p>However, as suggested above, the 1967 Sexual Offences Act has left itself open (particularly within the gay community) to claims of being as an essentially conservative measure that was only passed due to reasons of political expediency as opposed to the political establishment in Britain actually wishing to see a tangible democratisation of sexuality. By establishing such a high age of consent for gay couples, the Act only served to cement the social stigma associated with homosexuality because after this point it was seen by law in Britain to be a coupling that was deemed unsuitable (and illegal) for young people to engage in. Considering that the teenage years are the most important stage of sexual development in both males and females, the high age of consent deliberately aimed to restrict the practice of homosexuality amongst the very demographic that would be most likely to engage in ‘experimental’ sexuality. This only increased the sordid image of homosexuals in Britain at the time, implying that adult homosexual men were in some way intent upon ‘grooming’ young males to join their own sexual brand of subculture. Viewed through this prism, the Sexual Offences Act can be seen to be a positive legal step but likewise a negative cultural step. The increase in the number of arrests of gay men in the years that immediately followed 1967 should be seen as testimony to this ultimate perpetuation of inequality pertaining to sexuality which was the socio-political residue of the Sexual Offences Act. In this way, the myth of the permissive society was established to satisfy the libertarian ideology of the left wing of the political elite. The satisfaction and status of gay people, on the other hand, seems not to have been a consideration concerning the passing of this landmark piece of domestic legislation.</p><p>In specific terms of the evolution of queer theory, the 1967 Sexual Offences Act can be seen to have helped to create fertile grounds for the blossoming of the domestic and international gay rights movement because of the way in which the Act of Parliament served to legally solidify the differences between homosexual and heterosexual people. This sense of marginalisation from mainstream society was aided by the Stonewall Riots which took place in New York City in 1969 in response to police brutality against homosexual and transgender people at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. This episode provided the impetus behind the formation of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) which was established in July 1969, quickly becoming a trans-national phenomenon that deeply influenced the gay rights movement in the UK. The cumulative result of the prejudices legalised in the 1967 Sexual Offences Act in addition to the prejudices brutally realised in New York City in the Stonewall Riots was to construct a gay movement that was both durable and international. Furthermore, the perceived injustices of the 1960s also served to ally the lesbian and gay movements so that one tangible homosexual community was evident by the turn of the decade in both Europe and the United States of America. This time period was therefore a crucial moment in the development of queer theory in post war Britain.</p><p>However, it can be argued that by forming a global gay movement that judged membership with the movement in terms of sexual identity, international movements such as the Gay Liberation Front succeeded only in affirming the divisions put forward by measures like the Sexual Offences Act. Queer theory, from the outset, was intent upon challenging the mainstream socio-political status quo by using means that were essentially counter productive in light of the gay movement’s arguments that gender and sexual identity was not ‘fixed’ or compartmentalised according to one’s sexuality but was in fact much more fluid and interchangeable. Indeed, queer theorists have since argued that the compartmentalisation of gender is likewise flawed with Anne Fausto-Sterling arguing that “male and female are not enough.” By separating ‘them'(heterosexuals) from ‘us’ (homosexuals and transsexuals) the queer movement merely served to corroborate the fragmented vision of mainstream society and to further alienate homosexuality from mainstream culture and, as a result, to condemn queer theory to a discernible subculture status. Consequently, the 1967 Sexual Offences Act – taken within the broader context of the worldwide civil rights movement of the 1960s – can be seen to be an important milestone within the evolution of queer theory as not only did politicised society initiate a clear dividing line between the homosexual and the heterosexual communities but also the homosexual community itself was largely responsible after this point for perpetuating this divide. In the final analysis therefore, it is difficult to envisage this development as positive or progressive. Indeed, as Michael Botnick demonstrates below, this lack of awareness on both sides of the historical debate resulted in a discernible lack of consensus by the turn of the millennium.</p><p>“The lack of open-mindedness toward complex and graduated positions makes it difficult to obtain a full hearing of the issues, especially if those issues are value laden and cognitively dissonant to the audience (generally the public at large, the state, major corporations or other mega-organisations such as the media.)”</p><p>At this point in the discussion, attention must move away from the historiographic look at the formation of the gay rights movement within the context of the late 1960s to turn instead towards analysis of queer theory in post war twentieth century Britain. As has already been intimated, the evolution of queer theory in the UK is intrinsically tied to the advent of the Sexual Offences Act of 1967. The injustices conceptualised in this Act served to galvanise the gay community amid the broader backdrop of a civil rights movement that was established in order to attempt to attain parity on the grounds of race, religion and gender as well as parity on the grounds of sexuality. This wider multicultural influence is the key to understanding how the doctrine of queer theory in post war Britain quickly became divorced from the social, cultural and political reality of maintaining a subcultural movement within the context of a liberal democracy. It is certainly no coincidence that the guiding principle of queer theory was inherently similar to the guiding principle of the other civil rights movements of the epoch: all highlighted the fallacy of using identity (be it sexual, racial, religious or gender) as a means of organising political society. All of these movements should therefore be viewed as part of a wider post-structuralist theory which advocated the end of identity based upon gender, sexuality, race and religion in favour of adopting a more egalitarian approach. In this way, post-structuralist theory was keen to destroy the link between “dominant western forms of rationality with male power and control over women and nature, which is associated with violence, oppression and destruction.”</p><p>Queer theory should be seen as an important part of this desire to deconstruct male-ordered politicised society and to reconstruct this society not along lines pertaining to identity but along lines pertaining to humanity instead. In terms of results, the deconstruction of male-centric society can be seen to have had a positive impact upon the fusion of homosexual and heterosexual cultures in post war Britain, certainly after the 1980s when the AIDS epidemic in the United States quickly became a worldwide manifestation of what Stan Cohen had in the 1970s referred to as ‘moral panic’ disseminated by an increasingly powerful global mass media apparatus. Whereas the 1970s and the 1980s can be seen as a historical period of continuity with regards to the perpetuation of sexuality-based injustices in Britain, the 1990s on the other hand can be interpreted as a period of change – when the barriers constructed by male-ordered mainstream society were slowly, yet clearly being eroded in obvious ways. Politicians, for instance, in the 1990s were no longer punished in any tangible electoral way for being ‘outed’ as homosexual. The briefly successful New Labour career of Peter Mandelson is testimony to this development. Likewise in popular culture where international stars such as George Michael (who was afraid to admit his sexuality in the 1980s) have been able to thrive in both the heterosexual and homosexual spheres regardless of their own sexual preferences since the 1990s. The turn of the millennium also witnessed a legal progression concerning gay people and their civil rights with amendments to the Sexual Offences Act (passed in 2003) in Britain eventually giving rise to parity with heterosexual people with regards to the age of consent. Indeed, it can be argued that the 2003 Sexual Offences Amendment Act is as fundamental and extensive as the changes which were telegraphed when the Theft Act (1968) replaced the outmoded Larceny Act (1916). In the UK in the twenty first century the age of consent for both heterosexual and homosexual people is at last set at sixteen, finally putting to an end the decades-long association of homosexuality with perversity and social abnormality.</p><p>Yet, appearances can be deceptive. While the 1990s and the first decade of the twenty first century may appear to be the dawn of a new era of equality with regards to gender and sexuality, the reality may in fact be better understood as a period of continuity with the perceived advances of gay people during this time being nothing more than a mirage as male-dominated society continues to give piecemeal concessions to those marginalised elements of post modern culture in order to maintain the façade of a permissive contemporary society.</p><p>“It seems we’re an altogether more open, more tolerant, sexier society – and it’s getting better all the time. Or is it? Is mainstream culture just flirting with a bit of the other in order to keep us all on a broadly straight line?”</p><p>This sense of duplicity inherent concerning queer theory and socio-political reality in the contemporary era has served to render queer theory a doctrine of continuing importance in western culture. Contemporary gender theorists such as Judith Butler (who’s book <em>Gender Trouble</em> was published in 1990 selling over 100 000 copies internationally) directly challenged the notion of gender (and indeed sexuality) as a means of cultural identity, going so far as to cite the creation of international feminism as the reason behind women’s continuing experience of inequality. Butler thus called for a re-evaluation of queer theory in light of the mistakes made by the various civil, gender and sexual rights movements of the 1960s.</p><p>“The domains of political and linguistic ‘representation’ set out in advance the criterion by which subjects themselves are formed, with the result that representation is extended only to what can be acknowledged as a subject. In other words, the qualifications for being a subject must first be met before representation can be extended.”</p><p>Butler’s theory remains a cornerstone for queer theory in post war Britain as the travails of the women’s since the passing of the Sex Discrimination Act in 1964 largely mirrors the troubles of the gay movement since the inception of the Sexual Offences Act in 1967. As a result there is a large body of academic literature available that is dedicated to queer theory and to placing contemporary queer theory within the historiographical context of the gay experience in the past forty years. Much of the commentary bequeathed by this body of literature tends to underscore the essential continuity that characterises the development of sexuality in Britain (and indeed throughout the West) since the 1960s. Jeffrey Weeks, for example, sees this continuity as a symptom of contemporary society’s inability to comprehend sexuality within its correct (and complex) historical context.</p><p>“There is a struggle for the future of sexuality. But the ways we respond to this have been coloured by the force of the accumulated historical heritage and sexual traditions out of which we have come: the Christian organisation of belief in sex as sacramental and threatening, the libertarian belief of sex as subversive, the liberal belief of sex as source of identity and personal resource, all rooted in a melange of religious, scientific and sexological arguments about what sex is, what it can do and what we must or must not do. We are weighed down with a universe of expectations. Sexuality could be a potentiality for choice, change and diversity. Instead we take it as destiny, and all of us, women and men, homosexual and heterosexual, young and old, black and white, are held in its thrall, and pay its expensive dues.”</p><p>Weeks’ succinct observations quoted above could quite feasibly have featured in his best selling book, <em>Coming Out</em> (originally published in 1977) such is the lack of tangible progress made by mainstream society in the author’s view. This is entirely due to the fact that the vast majority of society has managed to evade the true nature of the issue where sexuality is neither a ‘choice’ nor a ‘cross to bear’ but is instead a complex fusion of the two. Weeks concludes that it is the very absence of a ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ answer with regards to the definition of sexuality that makes mainstream society unable to adequately confront the issue of homosexuality even at the start of the twenty first century.</p><p>Of course, the issue of homosexuality has been greatly affected by the rise in significance (at least in cultural terms) of bisexuality. Not only has bisexuality served to confuse the majority of mainstream society (in so much as mainstream society has been instructed to think in terms of black and white; right and wrong) about the nature of homosexuality, the advent of bi-theory has telegraphed a schism in queer theory. Indeed, it is a common view of the bisexual community that traditional queer theory “can be understood as a particularly virulent strain of the disease affecting contemporary theory more generally, especially in so far as it addresses sexuality as a central concern in the guise of ‘queer theory’.”</p><p>Thus, the very term ‘queer’ is seen, ironically, as an exclusive phrase that implies that bisexual people, on account of their continuing sexual association with heterosexual people, are intrinsically more allied to straight culture than they are to the homosexual community. This schism mirrors the divide in the feminist movement when a more radical ‘second wave’ of feminism “drew, in the first instance, upon the theoretical writings of lesbian feminism in the early 1970’s” only for the lesbian feminist community to later accuse the heterosexual feminist community of ‘betrayal’ on the grounds that straight women continued to participate in sexual activity and engage in what Pateman terms ‘sexual contracts’ with men in the guise of sex, marriage, home and family. Further confusion has been added to this maelstrom with the advent of trans-theory and the increasing legal and political recognition of trans-gender people, which has clearly impacted upon the evolution of queer theory in post war Britain. Jason Cromwell sees this development as “making the visible invisible”, which is in direct opposition to the principles of the gay community which has historically intended to make the invisible visible.</p><p>In addition there are – not surprisingly – critics from the straight mainstream culture who see queer theory as a barrier (rather than a facilitator) to a greater democratisation of sexuality in the contemporary era. Critics argue that queer studies places too much emphasis upon differentiation which, in turn, elevates the status of the gay and lesbian experience to a position that is over and above its true worth within the broader sphere of cultural studies. This only serves to increase the gulf between the ‘included’ and the ‘excluded’ members of society. Furthermore, queer theory has been challenged in a more direct way as critics argue the primacy of the queer belief that sexuality is not ‘fixed’. Tim Edwards, for example, has recently argued that sexual identity is in fact much more rigid and compartmentalised than queer theory suggests. Edwards does not agree with the assumptions made by, amongst others, Judith Butler and David Gauntlett who both show how, for instance, the media has helped to solidify the construction of identity based upon gender and sexuality respectively. Instead he argues that in real terms gender and sexual identity does not only exist at the level of discourse (as argued by Butler) but instead exists as “an institutional social practice.”</p><p>It can be seen that queer theory and its discontents have historically argued over ideological terrain pertaining to sexuality, gender and identity with a discernible lack of consensus emerging from the ensuing theoretical debates. It is also noticeable that the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 remains largely conspicuous by its absence from the vast majority of this theoretical debate with regards to queer theory in post war Britain. Where the Act is mentioned, it tends to be referred to as a piecemeal political measure that “proved repeatedly unsuccessful, largely because of popular mobilisation against restrictive changes.” Even in legal terms, the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 remains open to charges of being a draconian, anachronistic measure by contemporary queer theory as it was still deemed a criminal offence for people under the age of twenty one to engage in homosexual activity. This only served to criminalise the essential experimentalism inherent in young people of both sexes and to perpetuate the association of homosexuality as a sordid and sinful affair.</p><p>A more important watershed date according to post war queer theorists was the 1980s and the advent of the AIDS epidemic. Beginning on the west coast of the United States and quickly transferring over the Atlantic to Britain and Western Europe, the AIDS epidemic was an epidemic more in terms of the effect that it had upon mainstream, straight culture than the medical effect that the virus had upon the human race. Looking back on the media texts and images of the time, one can certainly see how the disease was blown out of all proportion to its true danger. Furthermore, it is plain to see that this was due to the sexual nature of the illness and, specifically, the fact that it had begun in the gay community. Once more, therefore, gay men were accused of leading a hedonistic lifestyle – the lack of the practice of safe sex being the starting point for the spreading of the disease. The AIDS epidemic also served to re-ignite traditional Christian doctrine that was – and remains – vehemently opposed to the legalisation and democratisation of homosexuality. Hard-line Christian activists even went so far as to claim that the AIDS virus was God’s punishment to all society for allowing gay people the right to practice their sordid sexuality in mainstream culture. The combined effect of this hysteria served to make the 1980s – as opposed to 1967 – the key date in queer theory in post war Britain. As Jeffrey Weeks declares, “the homophobia that was encouraged by AIDS demanded, and in fact greatly strengthened, lesbian and gay identities.”</p><p>With this in mind, attention must now be turned towards reaching a conclusion as to the significance of 1967 within the broader discussion of the democratisation of sexuality in post war Britain.</p><p>“That some people have decided preferences does not seem to be in doubt. What is now fast disappearing is the myriad of ways in which various human societies have managed to cope with the fact.”</p><p>As Naphy aptly suggests, the rate at which homosexuality has been integrated into mainstream culture should be judged within the much wider context of western civilisation over the past two thousand years as opposed to the forty years that have passed since the inception of the Sexual Offences Act in 1967. Ultimately, although progress concerning the democratisation of homosexuality may have met many obstacles in a variety of different guises – be they legal, political, social, religious or cultural – there cannot be any doubt that the gay community landscape has changed beyond all recognition in Britain since the end of the 1960s. Moreover, it would be difficult to launch an argument against 1967 being the key year within this evolution of queer theory in modern Britain as this was the date that marked the beginning of the solidification of a trans-national gay movement as well as the end of the historical marginalisation of homosexuals within the broader context of mainstream society.</p><p>The fact that the fruits of this dual, spontaneous realisation did not immediately materialise in the form of a democratisation of sexuality should not be seen as a great surprise. Like the women’s movement of the same era, there can be little doubt that the legal measures passed by parliament such as the Sex Discrimination Act served only to halt the advance of women’s rights as the movement inevitably splintered on matters pertaining to race, ideology and – increasingly – sexuality. In this way, the lesbian agenda became increasingly divorced from the mainstream feminist agenda in the same way that the bisexual agenda has become noticeably more antagonistic towards queer theory and the homosexual community. It can be argued that this is nothing more than an inevitable by-product of a post-industrial capitalist society that has made a cultural and economic commodity of sex and sexuality to such a degree as to destabilise the solidarity of the global gay and women’s movements worldwide. Thus, being a political as well as a sexual activity, homosexuality has been (and will remain) both historically and theoretically deeply influenced by the social, political and economic environment in which it is culturally defined.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Botnick, M.R. <em>Gay Community Survival in the New Millennium.</em> New York and London: The Haworth Press, 2000.</p><p>Butler, J. <em>Gender Trouble</em>.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://issuu.com/lawjuris/docs/the_development_of_modern_highways_">view with charts and images</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The development of modern highways has always depended upon the material available to build them</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>INTRODUCTION </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.1 GENERAL</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The development of modern highways has always depended upon the material available to build them. Early attempts to seal a pavement with tar or pitch led to the use of bitumen and to the high performance materials currently in use worldwide. This process of development continues today for improvement of the existing materials to perform better by modification through addition of additives and admixtures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The primary function of the pavement is to give the users a smooth, comfortable and safe ride at economical cost. One of the main drawbacks of bituminous pavement materials is that they combine `elastic’ and `plastic’ behavior, that is, when they deflect under load, a small part of the deflection becomes permanent. After individual loads these permanent deformations are practically invisible, but repeated loading of this effect can lead to rutting. The phenomenon is particularly prevalent in warm climates where the growing weights or tire pressures of the transport vehicles are present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The behavior of flexible pavement is very complex due to the inter-relation between factors influencing its performance. Some of the major observed asphalt pavement problems can be listed as (Thompson et. al. 1983):</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Rutting</li><li>Thermal and fatigue cracking</li><li>Hardening of binder</li><li>Flushing</li><li>Moisture susceptibility and stripping</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to deal with these problems, use of different types of additives in asphalt concrete mix is in use in various countries. For example, different types of “Filler Material” available are one such type of additive, which is known to affect the properties of the Asphaltic Concrete (AC) mixes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore any refinement of knowledge for use of such additives in AC mixes and their potential benefits, will find a good place in today’s world where lot of concern exist for these in widespread problems of major importance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.2 PROBLEM DEFINITION</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh is climatically a tropical country with combination of all type of weathers and an average 2000 mm of precipitation annually. To provide communication between the towns, huge investment has been placed in constructing quality roads that covered great distances, under extreme climatic and topographical conditions. Road pavement of the national, regional and major feeder roads is mainly of AC surfacing and designed for a design life of 15-20 years before any major maintenance and rehabilitation is needed. However, during the past few years, these roads with AC layers have been experiencing early distress and deterioration leading to failures ultimately.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from heavy axle loads, high tire pressure and climatic conditions, use of locally available low quality aggregate in road construction is one of the major contributors to failures. The construction industry faces a difficult situation in finding good performance aggregate. On highways and urban roads many damaged spots can be seen after the seasonal rains, especially in eastern half of the country where aggregate are weaker comparatively and sensitive to water. Since the transportation of good quality aggregate from nearby country is uneconomical, in the eastern half of the country. Therefore, certain modifications in AC mixes produced by using the local aggregate of Bolaganj source is needed to ensure a durable mix by incorporating additives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are a number of factors which may affect the performance of an AC layer. The major factors known to affect the material characteristics and behavior under traffic loading are; asphalt type and content, temperature variation, aggregate type and gradation, air voids, mix density, filler type and wheel loading or stress level. Among these the asphalt content and quality of the AC mix has direct effects on the stability and durability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Considerable research and development has been done to achieve a mix which can satisfactorily resist the major distresses and water sensitively problems in pavements. One of the major steps towards this is achieved by incorporating additives in AC mixes to improve its temperature and water susceptibilities, especially for extreme and tropical climate regions. Use of additives to significantly improve the properties of the AC mixes such as temperature and water susceptibilities, strength and durability had been reported by researches in countries like USA, India and Saudi Arabia (Ronald et. al. 1989). Such promising results could present a cure for different types of distress and deterioration in the pavement in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Among various types of additives and modifiers “Filler Material” is one, which is considered to improve the AC mix properties without affecting much on the overall economy AC pavements. There are different kinds of filler material available and is in use in different regions depending upon the improvement needed and the relevant functions they provide. Although different kind of filler used in AC mixes may result in performance improvements or better economy. However, each one has it’s own limitation. For example:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) Hydrated lime is widely used as an anti-stripping agent in AC mix, but it slightly increases the bitumen requirement in the mix thereby affecting economy. However, the achieved benefits in the improvement of properties and durability are considerable and feasible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) Asbestos fiber is reported to be an excellent filler material in AC mixes, but due to health hazard the use is discouraged <b>References</b></p><ol start="1" style="text-align: justify;" type="1"><li>Anderson, D.A., and Tarris, J.P., “Adding Dust Collector Fines to Asphalt paving Mixtures” NCHRP Report – 252 Dec. 1982. pp. 8-9</li><li>Aniruddha Vilas Shidhore, “ Use of Lime as anti-Strip additive for Mitigating Moisture susceptibility of asphalt Mixes containing Baghouse Fines”, M.S Thesis, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, 2005.</li><li>American association of state highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 2000, “Standard Specifications for Transportation Materials and Method of sampling and Testing, Part I and Part II, 20<sup>th</sup> Edition, USA</li><li>American Society for Testing and materials (ASTM), 2000, “Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Road and Paving Materials”, Section 4, Volume 4.03, Philadelphia, USA</li><li>Asphalt Institute, USA, “Mix Design Methods for Asphalt Concrete and Other Hot-Mix Types”, MS-2, Sixth Edition, 1995.</li><li>Asphalt Institute, “Asphalt technology and construction – Instructor’s Guide”, Education Series No. 1, College Park, Maryland.

The imported stone is consumed mainly in the Western part of country due to cost effectiveness. In the Eastern part of the country the local available stone of Bolaganj (Sylhet) is mainly used in aggregate production for the road pavement. Bolaganj stone have been reported to have an affinity towards water due to its hydrophilic character and AC mixes produced by using aggregate of these stone is susceptible to moisture and less durable thereby. In consideration of high annual rainfall and long rainy season, a necessity of modification of AC mixes is a need to control the moisture susceptibility aspects, which leads to stripping and raveling in the AC surfacing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore this study is taken up with an objective to:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) To review the available literature on the moisture susceptibility problems in the AC mixes, the types of the additives and modifiers and the effects of these on AC mixes in general and hydrated lime as modifier of AC mixes in particular</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Conduct laboratory tests on the specimens of AC mix without lime and modified AC mixes in varying percentage of hydrated lime to determine the engineering properties with respect to water susceptibility aspects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iii) Compare the properties of AC mix without lime and modified AC mixes with lime to evaluate the effects on moisture susceptibility behaviour and come up with the conclusions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.4 SCOPE AND APPROACH OF STUDY </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The findings of the study shall be applied in using the modified AC mixes with lime produced by using aggregate of crushed Bolaganj stone boulder with confidence in actual works to check and control the problems arising from water.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The scope of the study involves the following tasks:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Material characterization i.e., testing and evaluation of aggregate of Bolaganj origin and bitumen of Eastern Refinery (Bangladesh) in the laboratory for their quality and conformance with the specifications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Mix design using Marshall Method to arrive at the optimum mix for the AC wearing course gradation of RHD specification (2001).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3) Study characteristics of the modified AC mixes with hydrated lime in different percentages and carry out comparative analysis with the control optimum AC mix without lime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To achieve the study objectives, a systematic approach consisting of three main interconnected phases have been framed:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first phase consists of material collection and characterization to evaluate their quality with respect to conformance with applicable specifications. The second phase involves conducting mix design by Marshall Method and laboratory tests on control optimum AC mix without lime and modified AC mixes with lime in different percentages related to moisture susceptibility. The third phase involves data analysis, interpretation of results, conclusions and recommendation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.5 THESIS LAYOUT</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 1 presents the an overview of the problems being experienced with respect to moisture susceptibility in context of Bangladesh in AC mixes, the objectives, scope and approach of the study to arrive at conclusions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 2 is on a review if the literature on the subject matter with regards to modification of AC mixes by various additives in general and by modification using hydrated lime in particular. The chapter also covers the findings of researchers in the past to take account of those in the current study</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 3 presents the details related to characterization tests on constituent materials, mix design of AC mix for optimum mix and testing of Optimum AC mix without lime and modified AC mix with lime in varying doses for moisture susceptibility aspects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 4 presents test results, their analysis and evaluation adopting statistical approach and discussions for final conclusions on effects of modifications of AC mixes by lime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 5 presents the final findings and conclusions of the study. Recommendations for further researches and studies are also included in this chapter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CHAPTER 2</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.1 GENERAL</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of modifying asphalt mixtures is certainly not new, but has become much more prominent during the past few years due to frequent occurrence of problems in respect of early distresses and deteriorations in Asphalic Concrete (AC) mixes. To address theses problem for remedy one of the techniques being practiced in modern to modify the AC mixes by incorporation of various additives and admixtures. The factors that have some influence on an increased interest in modifying AC mixes include at least the following:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Traffic factors have increased including heavier loads, higher volume, and higher tire pressures.</li><li>To accommodate the shift from larger projects such as the Interstate System to smaller projects such as maintenance of the existing road network.</li><li>Higher costs have created a tendency to construct thinner pavements, thus reducing the service lives of pavements.</li><li>Environmental and economic pressure to dispose of certain industrial waste materials (i.e., tires, glass, ash etc) has prompted the idea of concerting them to additives in AC mixes.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">A family of products and processes are aimed at a variety of pavement application. The highway engineer knows that the complexity of pavement distress requires a choice of repair or rehabilitation options (one or two methods may not suffice). The appropriate modification of AC mixes has broadened the choices available to the engineer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Engineers who are familiar with the field performance of bituminous pavements generally agree on three potential modes of distress (Ronald et. al. 1989):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Distortion:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Settlement,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Rutting</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Cracking:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Repeated load (fatigue cracking)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Non-load (thermal cracking)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">· Disintegration:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Raveling (Loss of adhesion)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Stripping (moisture damage)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although most bituminous pavements perform satisfactorily, problems still do occur. Consequently, there is an increased interest in making changes that include several possibilities:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Improved pavement design (structural, damage, materials, etc.)</li><li>Revision of specifications for paving materials and pavements.</li><li>Improvement in the quality control of construction</li><li>Improvement of binders systems through modifications by additives.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">All of the above will contribute in improving the performance of the pavement system. However, the improvement of binder system through modification by additives has gained a primary interest (Terrel et. al. 1986)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2 ADDITIVE AND MODIFIERS</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An additive to the AC mix is a material which would normally be added during mix production, to improve the properties and/or performance. A bitumen extender is an additive which replaces a part of the mineral filler that would normally be used in the AC mix, and may additionally result in performance improvements or better economy (Terrel et. al 1986).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The justification or reasons for using an additive or extender would include the following:</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Solve or alleviate a pavement problem</li></ul><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Realize some benefits such as:</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Economy</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Environmental</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iii) Energy</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iv) Application and Performance</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Vehicle weights, traffic volume, and tire pressures are steadily increasing and demanding more and more from the pavement structures. Engineers face with serious problems with the quality of paving material. Often aggregates are transported from long distances at high cost because local aggregate supplies of high quality have been depleted. As a result, additives to AC mixes have been widely accepted by the paving industry for the present time. The concept of additives is logical, and results from laboratory testing look positive. Even though field test results using many additives are incomplete, many of those responsible for pavement quality are willing to use because the results appear to be favorable (Joe, W.B., 1991).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2.1 Types of Additives and Modifiers</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The generic classification has led to the following types of additives (Ronald et. al 1989):</p><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Fillers</li><li>Extenders</li><li>Polymers</li><li>Crumbed Rubber</li><li>Plastic</li><li>Fibers</li><li>Oxidants</li><li>Anti-oxidants</li><li>Hydrocarbons</li><li>Anti-stripping agents</li><li>Combinations</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the additives noted above provides benefits and improvements to the AC mix, either actual or perceived. The impetus to use one or more of these modifiers is generally based upon several factors. For example, a user agency may have a particular pavement problem and is in need of a solution. They in turn seek out additives or modifiers that provide some hope. Another approach has been to seek new markets for materials that are already available and have traditionally been used in other applications (Terrel et. al. 1986).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2.2 Filler as Additive and Modifier</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any fine powder added to bituminous mixture in the course of manufacture, and which has been processed to such a degree of fineness that not less than 85 percent by weight passes a 0.075 mm sieve is called “Filler<b>” </b>(Khanna, P.N., 1992).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Examples of Filler are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Mineral Fillers: </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Crusher fines/dust</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Lime</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iii) Portland Cement</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iv) Fly ash</p><p style="text-align: justify;">v) Granite dust</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Fiber material filler:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Natural Fibers:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) Asbestos (Hazardous)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) Rockwool (Non-Hazardous)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Man-made Fibers:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) Polyester</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) Fiberglass</p><p style="text-align: justify;">c) Steel Fibers</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Others:</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) Carbon Black</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) Sulfur</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iii) China Clay and Fuller’s earth</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mineral Fillers:</b> They are generally considered to be fine inert mineral materials a high proportion (at least 65 percent by ASTM and AASHTO specifications) of which will pass the 0.075 mm sieve”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The description is improved by adding a statement to the effect that filler is important because of the surface area involved, and that properties of a pavement which may be improved by the use of filler include strength, plasticity, amount of voids, resistance to water action, and resistance to weathering. In short, if filler is to be adequately described it is necessary to turn to the literature to try to determine what others have learned about it, or to attempt independent analysis in the laboratory and field.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fiber material filler: </b>Fiber provides some sort of reinforcement in the AC mixes. They also provide a finely divided material in the mix with a high surface area that permits the application of thicker than normal films of asphalt cement on the aggregate (Ronald et. al., 1989).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Natural, Synthetic and Steel Fibers have all been used in AC mixes. The usual approach is to incorporate very fine, short Fibers into the AC mixture, depending upon their form, chemistry, and intended function.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to the research, fiber linkage is a mechanism that may explain the resistance to rutting which asbestos imparts in bituminous paving mixtures. Selective adsorption on the short chrysotile asbestos fiber could bond or link together the heavy viscous bitumen fraction. Pavement stability against rutting would then depend on the strength of the heavy fraction, the amount present in the paving mix, and the proportion adsorbed by the asbestos fiber (Thomos et. al., 1962).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from asbestos, non-hazardous Rockwool fibers have been used in Great Britain and France, where fibers were added to the bituminous mixes during mixing, it was reported that it improved resistance to reflective cracking, deflection and there were no construction constraints (Terrel et. al., 1986).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2.3 Influence of Mineral Filler on AC mixes</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Extensive research, most of it from the early part of the century, has been done on the properties of mineral filler and its influence on asphalt concrete mixtures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Richardson, C, (1941) was one of the first investigators to report on the effects of mineral fillers. He postulated that the function of the filler is more than mere void filling, inferring that some sort of physico-chemical interaction occurs when fine mineral dust is added to AC mixes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Traxler, R. N., (1937) considered size and size distribution as fundamental filler properties that affect the void content. More recent work by Traxler confirms his earlier findings (Anderson el. at., 1982).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mitchell et. al., (1939) also attempted to find a single parameter that would adequately predict the ability of mineral filler to stiffen the bitumen in the AC mix. The data were obtained for mineral filler asphalt mixtures with relatively small concentrations of solids. The results indicated that the bulk settled volume of filler in benzene is a good predictor of the performance of the mineral filler.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A very extensive series of experiments on mineral fillers and mineral filler binder system has been reported by Rigden, (1954). In particular, he studied the relationship between filler properties and the viscosity of mineral filler binder mixtures. At filler bitumen ratios similar to those found in typical asphalt concrete mixtures, the fillers stiffened the asphalt by as much as three orders of magnitude. His data also indicate that fillers affect the temperature and water susceptibility of the AC mixes, however, the stiffening effect did not correlate with any of the fundamental properties of the fillers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The theology of mineral filler asphalt systems has been studied by Winniford, R. S., (1961) using the sliding plate micro-viscometer. Winniford suggested that the role of the filler is more than volume filling, and postulated additional stiffening mechanisms including.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1) A gelatin of the asphalt by the mineral surface, which increases the non Newtonian flow characteristics and lowers temperature susceptibility.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2) Formation of thick viscous coatings which increase the effective solids concentrations, and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3) Surface shielding by adsorbed asphaltenes. It was also shown that the stiffening effect of the mineral fillers was more pronounced with smaller sized materials.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Warden et. al., (1959) presented data on filler asphalt mixes in conjunction with filed observations. This study was motivated by field failures that were attributed to filler type. An easily measured parameter was sought that would predict the performance of the filler in the field. The tests performed on the fillers were empirical tests in use in the late 1950’s. A reexamination of the early work by Traxler again demonstrated that no single parameter was sufficient to predict the behavior of different mineral fillers. The softening point of the filler bitumen mixtures was found to be critical with respect to filler type.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Puzinauskas, V. P., (1968) reporting on The Asphalt Institute study of mineral filler concluded that the mineral filler plays a dual role in bituminous mixes. Stated that “they are part of the mineral aggregate and they fill the interstices and provide contact points between larger aggregate particles, when mixed with asphalt mineral fillers form a high consistency binder or matrix which cements larger aggregate particles together”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Craus ET. al., (1978) dealt with the effect of the physicochemical properties of filler on mix performance. In particular, they examined the geometric characteristics (shape, angularity, and surface texture), adsorption intensity at the filler asphalt interface, and the selective adsorption of the filler asphalt system. They concluded that the physicochemical interaction between filler and bitumen increased with the adsorption intensity, geometric irregularities, and selected adsorption of the fillers. The authors concluded that a single test on mineral filler cannot be expected to predict the behavior of the filler in the bituminous mixes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2.4 Theory of Filler</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Two fundamental theories, based on the results of studies, observations, and experience, have emerged regarding the functions of fillers in bituminous mixes:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Filler theory: </b>The filler theory postulates that “the filler serves to fill voids in the mineral aggregates and thereby create a denser mix”. This theory presumes that each particle of the filler is individually coated with bitumen and that such coated particles, either discrete or attached to an aggregate particle; serve to fill the voids in the aggregate. By virtue of such filling of voids, mixes of higher stability and density can be attained (Ladis H. Csanyi, 1962).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mastic Theory: </b>The Mastic theory proposes that he filler and bitumen combine to form mastic, which fill the voids and also bind aggregate particles together into a dense mass. When filler is added to bitumen, part of it will have a mechanical function where physical contact is not established and then filler and bitumen work together in the form of what can be called a binder. This finest portion of filler will be suspended in the asphalt, changing the properties of binder films. It will act as filler within the bitumen itself, since it will replace a certain amount of asphalt in the mixture. Mastic of this type is harder, stiffer, tougher, and possesses lower temperature and water susceptibility than the original bitumen (Hamad I. Al Abdul Wahab, 1981).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2.5 Filler Attributes </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The desired practical and functional quality attributes in a filler material should include the following (Warden et. al., 1959):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The filler in the bituminous mix must be non critical. Variations in the filler content which may be expected under normal plant operation must not cause undesirable fluctuations in the physical properties of the pavement. The yardstick or means of judging is the sensitivity of all the following quality attributes as a function of filler–bitumen ratio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The quantity of filler desired for functional reasons must not unfavorably affect the mixing, placing and compaction of the bituminous mixture. In other words at the desired concentration to meet design criteria the mortar softening point or consistency must not be so high that the mix is unworkable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Added mineral filler should be economical (availability and cost) and should be readily transported, stored, proportioned and mixed with customary equipment. Yardsticks for storing and proportioning are that the filler be non-hygroscopic and do not form lumps or cake or bridge in the bins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A completed pavement surfacing must be stable and durable over a wide range of temperature and over an extended period of time. This means that from the functional viewpoint the type and quantity of filler in the bituminous mixture must be such that the optimum void is maintained within the desired limits, both initially and after ultimate compaction, and that there is sufficient resistance to deformation by traffic at the highest service temperature. Concurrently the filler must not decrease the resistance to water or the bond of the bitumen or mortar to the aggregate and must not decrease durability through loss of flexibility by inducing cracking of the pavement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2.6 Role of Filler in AC mixes</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In general the functions of filler can be listed as follows (Khanna., P. N., 1992):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. To increase the viscosity of the binder and hence increase density and stability of the mixture.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. To enable a thicker film of binder to be held by the mixes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. To improve the resistance of the binder to weathering.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. To increase the effective volume of the binder</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. To reduce the apparent temperature and water susceptibility of the mixture (for dense surfacing-filler/binder mixtures have lower temperature and water susceptibility than straight binders of the same viscosity).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. To reduce the brittleness of a mix in cold weather, where the quantity of the filler can be considerably increased.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. To obtain a close texture on the surface after compaction</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Researchers have related the void properties of the filler to the Marshall Mix properties. For example, Hudson et. al., (1962) have related the activity coefficient to Marshall Stability. The activity coefficient is defined as the bulk volume of the filler to the solid volume of the filler. The bulk volume of the filler was determined from the settled volume of the filler in kerosene. For a given mixture, it was found that the activity coefficient is related to Marshall Stability. It was concluded, however, that the stability is a function of both filler type and concentration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Craus et al., (1978) concluded that the physicochemical interaction between filler and bitumen increased with the adsorption intensity, geometric irregularities, and selected adsorption of the fillers. These effects strengthen the filler bitumen bonds producing a mixture with a higher strength.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Summarizing the key points from the state of the art review on mineral fillers it can be concluded that:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Mineral fillers stiffen asphalt, and the degree of stiffening varies significantly between different fillers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. For a given filler source the finer the filler the greater the stiffening effect.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. Although performance varies for different fillers, there are no exact tests that can adequately predict their performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. Different fillers may react differently with different bitumen</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3 LIME AS FILLER AND MODIFIER TO AC MIX</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3.1 Chemistry </b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hydrated Lime, Calcium Hydroxide Ca (OH)<sub>2,</sub> commonly used in soil stabilization have also traditionally been used in AC mixes as a filler to improve the properties. Lime perhaps has special binding qualities in addition to the role of filler. It has been used for the purpose of providing stiffening or reinforcement to the bitumen as well as ‘Filling in’ the voids in the aggregate matrix (ES-2, Asphalt Institute).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Hydrated lime” is a dry powder obtained by hydrating quicklime with enough water to satisfy its chemical affinity, forming a hydroxide due to its chemically combined water (Robert S. Boynton, 1980). It has a surface area of 17-24 m<sup>2</sup>/gram.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3.2 Effect of Lime in AC Mixes</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hydrated lime has gained considerable recognition as a useful additive for improving the performance of bituminous pavements. It is added to some low grade aggregate to render them suitable in bituminous mixes for use in highway construction. Sometimes, it is difficult to coat certain aggregate with bitumen because of their siliceous or acidic surfaces. Hydrated lime, which is highly alkaline, starts a chemical reaction that changes the character of the aggregate surfaces and neutralizes any acidic properties present in the aggregate. Adding hydrated lime often improves the coat-ability and bonding properties of bitumen to these aggregate (Robert S. Boynton, 1980).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thomas W Kennedy et. al., (1984) in their study on “Techniques for reducing moisture damage in AC” reported that hydrated lime has been found to be a very effective additive. Indirect Tensile test results indicated that hydrated lime was effective in reducing stripping and moisture damage effects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Plancher, et. al., (1977) in their research suggested that hydrated lime absorbs carboxylic acids in the bituminous mixes which increase the water resistance and asphalt aggregate bonds.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Welch et. al., (1977) studied effect of hydrated lime on bitumen and aggregate mixtures and found that hydrated lime changes the mechanical properties of the mixtures. It has been shown by investigators that the addition of a small quantity of basic oxides such as calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, and Portland cement helps to maintain adhesion in the presence of water, and retard oxidative hardening (Ishai et. al., 1977).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The report on “Lime Treatment of Asphalt Mixes to reduce age hardening and improve flow properties” by a distinguished scientist, Peterson J. Claine indicated that lime treatment on AC mixes reduced asphalt age hardening, increased the high temperature stiffness of un-aged asphalts, reduced the stiffness in aged asphalts at higher temperatures and increased the asphalt tensile elongation at low temperatures. These effects benefit asphalt pavements by increasing asphalt durability, reducing rutting, shoving and other forms of permanent pavement deformation, improving fatigue resistance in aged pavements, and improving pavement resistance to low temperature transverse cracking. These benefits are in addition to the well documented effect of lime in increasing the resistance of pavements to moisture damage (Peterson, J Claine., et. el., 1987).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.3.3 Method and stage of lime addition</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The batch of mineral aggregate shall be dried to 300<sup>o</sup> F, the required quantity of additive shall be added to the aggregate, and the entire mass shall be thoroughly mixed until a uniform distribution of additive has been achieved. Care shall be taken to minimize loss of lime to the atmosphere in the form of dust. It is unified that the addition of hydrated lime to AC mixes does increase stability and reduce the hardening rate of bitumen present in the mixes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hydrated lime is usually added to aggregate at the pug-mill. It may serve as filler in the aggregate material. Researches have established that the addition of hydrated lime can increase bitumen content in the AC mixes over the normal bitumen content without risks of raveling or bleeding in the completed pavement. This produces a firmer, denser and more durable surface and considered effective in improving the water resistance of asphalt concrete (Peterson, J Claine., et. al., 1987).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.4 MIX DESIGN AND EVALUATION METHODS</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The major properties of AC paving mixtures are stability, durability, flexibility and skid resistance (in case of wearing surface). The mix design methods are the process and procedures to establish the aggregate particle size distribution and to determine the corresponding design asphalt content that would let the AC mix to perform satisfactorily, particularly with respect to stability and durability aspects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stability is defined by many engineers is the “resistance to deformation” with an implied emphasis towards resistance to flow or rutting, including resistance to tensile, compressive, and shear stresses that causes failure in a pavement surface. Durability has been defined as the resistance to the effects of weather and its combination with other forces. Durability is enhanced with high content of bitumen, however, resistance to flow or deformation is impaired with high bitumen content. As a consequence, the amount of bitumen to be used in a bituminous paving mix must be in a balance to optimize durability but yet maintain adequate stability (Jimenez, R. A., 1986).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are many mix design methods used throughout the world such as Marshall Mix design method, Hubbard field mix design method, Hemet Mix design method, Asphalt Institute’s Triaxial method of mix design etc. Out of these Marshall Mix design method is used in this study and discussed in detail.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.4.1 Mix Design by Marshall Method</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Marshall procedure as applied to design and control of bituminous mixtures used was evolved during the period from World War II to late 1950’s by U. S Army Corps of Engineers. Motivation for its development came from the need for a mix design procedure to proportion aggregate and bitumen border to sustain increasing wheel load and tire pressure of military aircrafts during World War II. In order to achieve these needs, Corps began an investigation to select a test apparatus that was simple and easily portable and could be used in the field for control purposes. The second phase of this study was to determine the method of compacting laboratory specimen in order to achieve the density as that obtained in field. The third phase of this investigation was the establishment of satisfactory design criteria and control procedure (Ziauddin, A. Khan, 1988).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Corps of Engineers selected a testing machine and a method of bituminous mix design conceived by Bruce Marshall of Mississippi State Highway Department. The Marshall Test procedure has been standardized by the American Society for Testing and Materials by ASTM designation D-1559 “Resistance to Plastic Flow of Bituminous Mixtures Using Marshall Apparatus”. The procedure and design criteria, is adopted by RHD with some modifications to suit the environmental conditions in Bangladesh and shown in Table 2.1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The use of these criteria must be limited to hot bituminous paving mixes using penetration grades of bitumen and containing aggregate size of 1 inch or less. The corps of Engineers found that, in order to have the proper balance between durability and stability, the air voids in the total mix should be limited to between 3 and 5 percent and the voids in the aggregate mass filled with bitumen 75 and 85 percent. The RHD standards requires the air voids to be between 3 and 5 percent for AC wearing course mixes and between 3 and 7 percent for base coarse mixes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since its development in 1940’s the Marshall method has increasingly been accepted by highway agencies throughout the world to design and control the bituminous paving mixtures. A review of literature indicates that Marshall Stability is a measure of tensile strength. Smith V. R, (1984) wrote in his research paper that the Marshall Stability values are affected primarily “by the tensile strength or cohesion properties of a mixture”. Benson, (1952) found a linear relationship between Marshall Stability and cohesion-meter value. It would seem to be apparent that the Marshall test does give a measure of tensile strength and that the success in preventing shear deformation (rutting) failure come form the control of aggregate texture and gradation, bitumen content, and compaction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the past few years, other supplementary tests such as indirect tensile test, resilient modulus and creep test etc. have been used to evaluate the engineering properties of AC mixes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Table 2.1: Mix Design Criteria for AC Wearing Course (RHD Project Specification – 2006) for heavy traffic &gt; 1 msa.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>Marshall Mix Criteria</td><td valign="top">Min.

The indirect tensile test can be used to characterize bituminous mixes in terms of (Kennedy, T.W., 1977):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) resilient elastic properties,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) properties related to thermal cracking,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">c) properties related to fatigue cracking, and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">d) properties related to permanent deformation</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The test is non-repetitive Indirect Tensile Strength and conducted by loading a cylindrical specimen with a single compressive load which acts parallel to and along vertical diametrical plane. This loading configuration develops a relatively uniform tensile stress perpendicular to the direction of applied Load and along the vertical diametrical plane, which ultimately causes specimen to fail by splitting along vertical diameter. The development of stresses within cylindrical specimen subjected to load is reported by (Kennedy et. al., 1977).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The test has been standardized as AASHTO T 283 under the title “Resistance of Compacted Asphalt Mixtures to Moisture Induced Damage”. Diametral Tensile Strength is also called Split Tensile Strength is a form of Indirect Tensile strength for measuring the change in diametral tensile strength resulting form the effect of saturation and accelerated water conditioning of compacted mix to simulate with field condition. The tests are conducted on the unconditioned test specimens and on conditioned test specimens after immersion in water at controlled temperature to find the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) parameter. The result is used for prediction of long term stripping susceptibility from water on the bituminous mix and evaluating the performance of Anti-Stripping additives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The equation employed in calculating the tensile strength is:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in FPS units ?<sub>T</sub> = 2P <sub>max</sub>/?hD …….. (2.1)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in SI units ?<sub>T</sub> = 2000P <sub>max</sub>/?hD …….(2.2)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where: (?<sub>T</sub>) is Indirect/splittensile strength; (P<sub>max</sub>) is the load at failure, (D) diameter and (h) the thickness of test specimen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tensile Strength ratio (TSR) = (?<sub>T2 </sub>/ ?<sub>T1</sub>) ………. (2.3)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where: (?<sub>T1</sub>)is average tensile strength of unconditioned subset of test specimen and (?<sub>T2</sub>) is the average tensile strength of the conditioned subset of test specimens</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.4.3 Resilient Modulas</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The elastic modulus of asphalt treated material can be determined by means of the diametral resilient modulus (M<sub>R</sub>) device. This test is basically a repetitive load test using the stress distribution principles of the indirect tensile test. Like the non-repetitive indirect tensile test, the main advantage of this test procedure is the simplicity of the test equipment as well as the ability to test asphalt specimens similar in size to those used for the widely known Marshall and Hemet tests.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A repetitive (pulsating load) of 0.1 second duration and 0.9 second dwell time is applied diametrically to the test specimen. The dynamic load, in turn, results in dynamic deformations across the horizontal diametrical plane. These deformations are recorded by transducers mounted on each side of the horizontal specimen axis. Knowledge of the dynamic load and deformation allows the M<sub>R</sub> value to be calculated. Thus, for an applied dynamic load of ‘P’ for the duration‘t’ to produce a resulting horizontal dynamic deformation (?<sub>h</sub>), the modulus or M<sub>R</sub> value is (Yoder, E. J., et. al., 1975):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">M<sub>R </sub>=P (? + 0.2374) / (t ?<sub>h</sub>) ……… (2.4)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A commonly used value of Poisson’s ratio (m) for AC mix materials is 0.35</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.4.4 Fatigue and Permanent Deformation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Fatigue” is the phenomena of repetitive load induced cracking due to a repeated stress or strain level below the ultimate strength of the material. Fatigue tests may be conducted by several test methods and various specimens. Repeated load indirect tensile (split tensile) test have also been used. The research work had been carried out at Ohio State University also which is based upon fracture mechanic principles applied to a more mechanistic solution of the fatigue problem (Yoder, E. J., et. al., 1975).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A common method for evaluating the fatigue characteristics of the AC mix is by repeated flexural testing. In this testing the specimen is applied with a repeated load having sine wave, with a certain adjusted loading and unloading (rest) time. Because of the effect of varying stiffness upon AC fatigue tests, a temperature control system is used around the flexural load device. The range in stress level is selected so as to yield a range in fatigue life between 100 to 1,000,000 repetitions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fatigue testing may be conducted under two types of controlled loading. They are either (i) Controlled stress or (ii) Controlled strain. In the controlled stress mode a constant load is continuously applied to the specimen. Because of progressive damage to the specimen, a decrease in stiffness results in. This, in turn, causes an increase of the actual flexural strain with load applications. For the controlled strain (deflection) approach, the load is continuously changed to yield a constant beam deflection. This results in a stress that continuously decreases with load applications, However, since controlled stress conditions give more conservative estimate of the fatigue life (N<sub>f</sub>)and is easy to apply, this test may be safely employed. For controlled stress testing, conducted in the laboratory, the effect of stiffness may be accounted for by plotting the fatigue results in a critical tensile strain applied (?) versus (N<sub>f</sub>) relationship on logarithmic scale. This results in a relationship for fatigue tests of the form (Tayebali et. al., 2004):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">N<sub>f </sub> = 4.9016 x 10<sup>-2 </sup>x(e)<sup>0.03029 VFB </sup>x (?)<sup>-3.8034</sup> x (S<sub>0</sub>)<sup>-0.98505 </sup>…….. (2.5)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">S<sub>0</sub> = 8.560 x (G<sub>0</sub>)<sup>0.9130</sup> .…….. (2.6)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where (S<sub>0</sub>) is the Dynamic flexural stiffness and (G<sub>0</sub>) is dynamic shear stiffness</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Permanent Deformation” is a longitudinal depression that forms in the wheel track due to consolidation in one or more of the pavement layers due to repeated traffic load applications. The depressions or ruts are of concern for at least two reasons:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) if the surface is impervious, the ruts trap water and at depths of 0.2 inch, hydroplaning (particularly for passenger cars) is a definite threat.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) As the ruts progress in depth, steering becomes increasingly difficult, leading to added safety concern.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For pavements in hot tropical climates and subjected to large number of heavy vehicles and/or vehicles operating at high tire pressures, rutting can be a controlling factor. The relationship at a particular number of load repetitions can be stated as:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">?<sub>p </sub>= f( ?<sub>ij </sub>)= (5.9055 x 10<sup>-3</sup>)x Y<sub>t</sub> ……….. (2.7)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where (Y<sub>t</sub>) is the total vertical deformation, mm</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.4.5 Creep</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shell researchers have developed a pavement design system in which rutting potential of asphalt concrete is characterized by a simple “Creep Test”. This has lead to the establishment of an empirical link between rheological properties of bitumen and visco-plastic behaviour of asphalt concrete. The test has been designed for the following purposes (Kamyar Mahboob, 1990):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) To measure compressive stiffness or compliance properties of mixture</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ii) To establish plastic flow potential of AC mixes under various stress states in terms of visco-plastic strains.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the research of Van der Poel, (1954) the Creep deformation of cylindrical specimen under a uni-axial, static compressive load is measured as a function of time. In this test, a constant stress (?<sub>0</sub>) is applied to the specimen and the resulting time dependent strain (?<sub>t</sub>) is measured. For permanent deformation characterization the relevant quality is the stiffness modulus of mix (S<sub>mix</sub>) defined as (Ziauddin A Khan, 1988):</p><p style="text-align: justify;">S<sub>mix =</sub> (?<sub>0 </sub>/ ?<sub>t</sub>) ………….. (2.8)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where: (?<sub>0</sub>) is Applied Stress, (?<sub>t</sub>) is measured strain at time (t) and equell to ?h / h<sub>0</sub>, ?h is Change in height of specimen and h<sub>0 </sub>is the Original height of the specimen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the studies, the researchers had recommend a minimum creep modulus of 80 Mpa (120,000 psi) at 40 <sup>o</sup>C and stress of 200 kpa (30 psi) for conditions of heavy, slow moving traffic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.5 SUMMARY</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stripping and damages from water susceptibility is a serious problem faced by the Road project implementing agencies. Two types of testing procedure have been developed to predict the moisture susceptibility of AC mixes: strength and subjective. In strength test, the TSR data have been widely accepted. The Marshall Test equipment can be used by replacing the testing head with an accessory suitable to test the Indirect Tensile Strength in accordance with procedure AASHTO T 283 without major additional expenditures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CHAPTER 3</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION, MIX DESIGN AND MOISTURE SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTS</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.1 GENERAL</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Material characterization consists of evaluation of engineering properties of component materials i.e., bitumen and aggregate, mix design include determination of design Asphalt content for layer gradation by Marshall procedure and moisture susceptibility tests covers Marshall stability and Indirect tensile strength determinations.

There is a claim and counter-claim between the petitioner and the Agrani Bank. Petitioner filed a suit claiming a sum of Tk. 75,55,020.28 paisa after adjustment. The defendant Bank also filed a money suit for realization of Tk. 94,64,543.32 paisa. The suits are pending. The plaintiff-petitioner filed an ap­plication for mandatory injunction for return of the pass book deposited with the defendant bank. The trial Court allowed the application for mandatory injunction in modified form and directed the Bank to return the pass book either to the C.C.I.E. or to the nominated bank of the appellant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. On appeal, the High Court Division set aside the order of the Commercial Court and directed the petitioner to furnish security to the extent of the claim of the bank whereupon the defendant bank is to return the import pass book either to the C.C.I.E. or to the nominated bank of the petitioner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. Mr. Asrarul Hossain, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant, contended that the im­port pass book issued by the C.C.I.E. could not be a security for the purpose of banker’s general lien within the meaning of section 171 of the Contract Act because it is neither transferable nor saleable nor the same is a goods under the Sale of Goods Act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. Mr. M. Nurullah, the learned counsel ap­pearing for the respondent, pointed out that the mat­ter has arisen out of an interlocutory matter, namely, whether the mandatory injunction should be issued for return of the pass book. The learned counsel contended that the moot question is pending for consid­eration in the two suits that has been filed by the Appellant and the Respondent claiming and counter-claiming their dues after adjustment. The learned counsel contended that if the contention of the appel­lant that the pass book has no value or saleable in­terest nor it is a security then why he is so anxious for obtaining a mandatory injunction. It is a self-defeating argument that has been advanced by the ap­pellant. Mr. M. Nurullah suggested that instead of deciding this interlocutory matter arising out of a pending suit the safe course would be if the suits themselves are expedited and disposed at an early date thereby putting an end to the controversy which arose in interlocutory matter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. Mr. Asrarul Hossain also accepted the prop­osition that the best course will be for quick dispo­sal of the suits which are pending.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. It is well-settled that the Court will not de­cide a point especially in the interlocutory matter which will not advance cause of justice. It will merely delay the process of coming to a conclusion as to claim and counter-claim which can only be thrashed out in the pending suits. Accordingly, we dispose of this appeal by a direction. Since the suits are pending since 1985 in the trial Court and those are listed for peremptory hearing, ends of justice would be met sufficiently if the suits are expedited and disposed of. Accordingly we direct, this being a financial matter involving adjustments, the two suits being Title Suit No. 240 of 1985 and Title Suit No.290 of 1985 pending in the 1st Commercial Court, Dhaka be tried and disposed of by 30th No­vember, 1989.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. With the above observations, this appeal is disposed of without any order as to costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Source: 42 DLR (AD) (1990) 60</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>A wholly owned subsidiary is a company whose common stock is 100% owned by another company, the parent company. Whereas a company can become a wholly owned subsidiary through an acquisition by the parent company or having been spun off from the parent company, a regular subsidiary is 51 to 99% owned by the parent company. When lower costs and risks are desirable or when it is not possible to obtain complete or majority control, the parent company might introduce an affiliate, associate or associate company in which it would own a minority stake.</p><div class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-3"><p>A subsidiary company is a company owned and controlled by another company. The owning company is called a parent company or sometimes a holding company.</p></div><div class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-5"><p>A subsidiary’s parent company may be the sole owner or one of several owners. If a parent company or holding company owns 100% of another company, that company is called a “wholly owned subsidiary.”</p></div><div class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-7"><p>There is a difference between a parent company and a holding company in terms of operations. A holding company has no operations of its own; it owns a controlling share of stock and holds assets of other companies (the subsidiary companies).</p></div><div class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-9"><p>A parent company is simply a company that runs a business and that owns another business — the subsidiary. The parent company has operations of its own, and the subsidiary may carry on a related business. For example, the subsidiary might own and manage property assets of the parent company, to keep the liability from those assets separate.</p></div><div class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-11"><p>A corporation or S corporation is owned by shareholders. In this case, the parent company typically holds 50% or more of the stock of the subsidiary.</p></div><div class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-13"><p>An LLC is owned by members, whose ownership percentage is controlled by an operating agreement. An LLC can own another LLC.</p></div><p>According to section 4 of the Companies Act, a company shall be deemed to be a subsidiary of another, if and only if:</p><p>(a) that other controls the compositions of its Board of directors; or</p><p>(b) that other holds more than half in nominal value of its equity share capital(where a company had preference share holders, before commencement of the Companies Act,1956, enjoying voting rights with that of equity shareholder, for the purpose of control, holding company should enjoy more than half of the total voting power) ; or</p><p>(c) the first-mentioned company is a subsidiary of any company which is that other’s subsidiary.</p><p>For example, where company B is a subsidiary of company A and company C is a subsidiary of company B then company C shall be the subsidiary of company A. if company D is a subsidiary of company C, then company D shall also be a subsidiary of company B and consequently also of company A.</p><p>In the case of M.Velayudhan v. Registrar of Companies The position regarding holding-subsidiary relationship was extensively laid down :</p><p>“Sec. 4 envisages the existence of subsidiary companies in different situations. It may be that by acquiring sufficient share capital of a company, sufficient control may be obtained over the company to enable control in the composition of BOD. But, it is also possible to obtain such control in regard to the composition of the BOD without making such an in equity capital of the company. Such control may be by reason of an agreement such as where one company may agree to advance funds to another company and in return may, under the term of an agreement, gain control over the right to appoint all or a majority of BOD. The first of the cases envisaged in section 4 is the case where a control is obtained by a company in the matter of composition of the BOD of another company. That would be sufficient to constitute the former as holding company and the other as subsidiary. The second type of cases is where more than half of the nominal value of the equity share capital is held by another company. By virtue of such holding that other company becomes a holding company and the one whose share are so held becomes a subsidiary company. The third case envisaged is where a subsidiary company of a holding company may be a holding company in relation to another company. That other company is also a subsidiary of the holding company of the subsidiary”.</p><p>So basically speaking, when a particular company A owns/ acquires more than fifty per cent of voting stock of another company B, then in such circumstances company B becomes the subsidiary of Company A, thus also obtaining the control of its operations, the company A (the acquiring company) becomes the subsidiary company’s(company B) parent company. The parent company maybe sometimes, be organized for holding of stock in other companies, such parent companies are called “holding companies”. A “wholly owned subsidiary” is when the parent company owns all the voting stocks of another company. A company also may become a subsidiary through acquisition. A company may establish a subsidiary by forming a new corporation and retaining all or part of its stock.</p><p><strong>Research Methodology</strong></p><p>Specific object- The aim of the project is to study subsidiary and wholly owned subsidiary company and identify the difference between subsidiary and wholly owned subsidiary company.</p><p>Discussion points- The researcher would like to answer the following questions-</p><p><strong>1. What is a Subsidiary and Wholly Owned Subsidiary?</strong></p><p><strong>2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Subsidiary and Wholly Owned Subsidiary?</strong></p><p><strong>3. While in the process of answering the above mention questions identify the difference between them.</strong></p><p>Hypothesis- The definition of subsidiary and wholly owned subsidiary company has been stated under sec. 4 of the Company Act. But the area of their differences and their advantages and disadvantages is somewhat unclear.</p><p>Methodology &amp; review of literature- The trend of research undertaken by the researcher has been largely based on secondary resources and electronic sources. The researcher has used books and online resources to elaborate of the topic.</p><p><strong>Subsidiary and Wholly Owned Subsidiary</strong></p><p>Subsidiary Corporations</p><p>A subsidiary company is a company which is owned by a larger company or corporation. The larger company is known as the parent corporation. The parent company can own the subsidiary company by owning more than 50% of the issued share capital. Subsidiary companies should not be confused with mergers where the parent company purchases a company and dissolves its identity and organizational structure. A subsidiary company may own subsidiary companies which will consequently be subsidiaries of the parent company. For the purposes of taxation and regulation, subsidiary companies are separate legal entities.</p><p>There are two ways a subsidiary company can be formed: one is when a corporation purchases a controlling interest in an existing company. The second is where the corporation creates a subsidiary itself. When a corporation acquires an existing company, forming a subsidiary can be preferable to a merger because the parent corporation can acquire a controlling interest with a smaller investment than a merger would require.  And unlike in mergers, the approval of stockholders of the acquired firm is not required. When a company is purchased, the parent corporation may determine that the acquired company’s name recognition in the market merits making it a subsidiary rather than merging it with the parent company. A merger is not suitable if the subsidiary produces goods and services that are different to those of the parent corporation. Corporations that operate in more than one country often find it useful or necessary to create subsidiaries. For example, a multinational corporation may create a subsidiary in a country to obtain favorable tax treatment, or a country may require multinational corporations to establish local subsidiaries in order to do business there.</p><p>A parent company should take the following steps in order to ensure control of a subsidiary without interfering into the matters of the subsidiary company i.e. allowing the subsidiary company to operate as an independent entity under the direction of its BOD  :</p><p>(1) Be the sole shareholder;</p><p>(2) Include voting control provisions in the subsidiary’s articles of incorporation along with provisions that prohibit amendment of the articles without the approval of the sole shareholder;</p><p>(3) Prepare comprehensive bylaws defining the designation and authority of officers, their term of office, their removal (for cause, or for any or no reason);</p><p>(4) Include in the bylaws the procedure whereby the parent elects and removes directors; and</p><p>(5) Prohibit bylaw amendments without the sole shareholder’s approval, etc.</p><p>Subsidiaries can also be created for the specific purpose of limiting their liability in connection with a new business that may be considered risky. Since the parent and subsidiary companies remain separate legal entities, they do not share in the obligations and liabilities of one another. However, it is not uncommon for the parent company to be sued if its subsidiary suffers from financial insecurity. Generally, the separate legal identities of the two companies will ensure that the parent company is immune from financial liabilities of the subsidiary, but there can be some exceptions.</p><p>Wholly-Owned Subsidiary</p><p>A ‘wholly-owned subsidiary’ is a company which has the whole of its common stock owned by another company. This means that there are no individual shareholders and that the common stock is not publicly traded. The subsidiary, being a separate legal entity, is organized as a corporation with its own structure and management. However, its day-to-day operations may be completely controlled by the parent company or the subsidiary may be allowed some independence.</p><p>Companies can derive various advantages of the structure of a wholly-owned subsidiary. In countries where the licensing environment makes it difficult to create a new company, the parent company can take control of an existing company which has the authority to conduct business there. Acquiring a subsidiary that already holds a permit simplifies the ability to conduct business without delays.</p><p>A parent company is usually a publicly-traded company. The profit or loss of all wholly-owned subsidiaries is consolidated into the parent company and the parent company releases information pertaining to all subsidiary businesses in a single annual report. Sometimes, the parent company only serves the role of a holding company to own other companies. In such a case, the parent company does not have any operations besides managing a group of wholly-owned subsidiaries.</p><p>For all the benefits that arise out of owning a subsidiary, the management of the subsidiary can be restricted by autonomy enforced by the parent company. If a private company is acquired by a public corporation, the change in management style can lead to a period of rough transition. Subsidiary management is often carried out by bringing in replacements from within the employees of the parent company. An exception is when the subsidiary management has knowledge or experience which is not readily available to the parent company.</p><p><strong>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages</strong></p><p><strong>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages Of Subsidiary Corporations</strong></p><p>One of the advantages to in having a subsidiary company is from the accounting perspective as there are many tax and legal benefits. It gives the ability to offset profits and losses of one part of business with another on federal tax returns and of course there are tax benefits at state and international level as subsidiaries in some states are allowed to file tax returns only on profits generated within the state area and not those profits that are generated on other locations, and the same is true for many companies that set up subsidiaries internationally. Hence the profits and losses of that subsidiary company will be taxed only according to the country they have been set up. It also provides few legal benefits, the most beneficiary is that if a subsidiary company suffers any liability, then the liabilities and credit claims won’t be passed on to the parent company, ensuring that the assets of the parent company suffer no harm even though the subsidiary is suffering financially. It also allows taking part in joint ventures with other companies, where each party owns a part of the new business.</p><p>As long as the parent company holds its subsidiary accountable for the expectations of its board of directors there is little risk for the parent to be found liable for the wrong doings of the subsidiary. But, if the parent company exercises excessive control for example has the same board of directors, use of common letterhead, in such case the parent company and the subsidiary are treated as one and the parent company is responsible for the subsidiaries debts etc.</p><p>Therefore to summarize it all:</p><p>Advantages</p><ul><li>Considerable tax advantages and legal protections,</li><li>Ability to offset profits and losses of one part of a business with another,</li><li>Some countries allow subsidiaries to file tax returns on the profits obtained in that country,</li><li>Liabilities and credit claims are locked in that subsidiary and cannot be passed on to the parent company,</li><li>Allows for joint ventures with other companies with each owning a portion of the new business operation.</li></ul><p>Disadvantages</p><ul><li>Legal paperwork involved with creating a subsidiary can be lengthy and expensive,</li><li>Control also becomes an issue when a subsidiary is partially owned by another outside organization,</li></ul><p><strong>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages Of Wholly-Owned Subsidiary</strong></p><p>Usually, an individual cannot function as a subsidiary because a business unit functions only through its board of directors and employees. However, one can obtain control of the company by obtaining ownership of the company’s stocks, by a wholly owned subsidiary. There are many advantages of setting up a wholly owned subsidiary which include the following  :</p><p>“Offers security and good protection for the proprietary information, company’s trade secrets, expertise and technical knowledge, apart from offering a high degree of control over the operations. Unlike in a joint venture, in a wholly owned subsidiary, the company’s trade secrets, technological competence and administrative decisions can be well-guarded”.</p><p>“Improves global strategic coordination as it offers strong control over the global operations of that subsidiary. This is particularly significant in the case of parent companies which need to completely rely on foreign managers to manage the operations of their various plants”.</p><p>However, considering the huge amount of capital required it’s not always easy to set up this form of subsidiary and there is always the added fear of failure, as there are risks of making wrong decisions because it is new and unfamiliar to the type of market trends and fluctuation situation. Following two points are a major disadvantage of these types of subsidiaries  :</p><p>The first and foremost point to be considered while setting up a wholly owned subsidiary is the huge amount of initial investment capital. The firm will have no other option but to bear all of the establishment costs for setting up the subsidiary on foreign land and operational costs to cover the global operations of this subsidiary,</p><p>The second and most dangerous drawback is that there is the risk associated with becoming a subsidiary. This risk is the risk of failure. The situation can go out of the hand, especially if a foreign subsidiary rushes ahead recklessly without trying to get familiarized with the cultural aspects and market swings in the host country. Often, it is seen that the subsidiary comes down crashing in no time. The main cause behind the failure of a subsidiary on foreign land is the fact that a subsidiary ends up being ignorant of the host country’s market situation and fluctuating market trends. The subsidiaries often end up misjudging the host country’s market situation and make erroneous decision.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p>In a subsidiary the parent company gains tax and legal advantage, there is no liability for being legally responsibility for the Liabilities and credit claims of the subsidiary as it cannot be passed on to the parent company, the parent company can also form a joint ventures with other companies with each owning a portion of the new business operation as well as the ability to offset profits and losses of one part of a business with another whereas wholly owned subsidiary offers security and good protection apart from offering a high degree of control over the operations, it also improves global strategic coordination as it offers strong control over the global operations of that subsidiary.</p><p>On the other hand in a subsidiary there is the disadvantage of lengthy and expensive legal paperwork involved with creating a subsidiary and also control also becomes an issue when a subsidiary is partially owned by another outside organization whereas in a wholly owned subsidiary huge amount of initial investment capital is required, like the establishment costs &amp; operational costs etc, and also risk of failure especially if a foreign subsidiary rushes ahead recklessly without trying to get familiarized with the cultural aspects and market swings in the host country.</p><p>Therefore looking at both the advantages and disadvantages of a subsidiary company and a wholly owned subsidiary the researcher feels that he can safely conclude that a subsidiary company is more profitable than wholly owned subsidiary.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><div><p><a id="_Hlk517605108"></a>Most individuals are fortunate and go their entire life without having to step foot in a courtroom on the other hand for some individuals the courtroom is like a second home.  This paper will <a id="_Hlk517605162"></a>compare and contrast two types of laws, civil and criminal laws in the United States (U.S.) and the structure of the state and federal court systems.  The U.S. court system is based on two levels, a federal system and a state system both have specific duties and powers, many state courts mirror the federal system.</p><p><strong>Civil Law</strong></p><p>Many people do not have a clue about what civil law is about, television shows like Judge Judy show simple examples of civil law cases.  An issue between parties or grievance to an individual or other private party is a civil law, an example is a breach of contract between an individual and business.  These cases are filed by a private party or plaintiff against a defendant, presided over by a judge, some cases may involve juries.  To win a civil case, the plaintiff must establish the defendant’s liability only according to the preponderance of evidence; and defendants are not entitled to the same legal protections as are the criminally accused</p><p>These types of cases Punishment in these cases almost always involves a monetary award and never consists of imprisonment.  (Duignan, 2018).  Preponderance of evidence is the more convincing evidence and its probable truth or accuracy, and not on the amount of evidence (Law.com, 2018).</p><p><strong>Criminal Law</strong></p><p>Television has created a double edge sword for the criminal court system, shows like Law and Order show how quick and easy it is to get the bad guy.  Criminal law is a crime against the public an example is murder (Duignan, 2018).  In criminal cases, only the federal or a state government or in other words the prosecution may initiate a case against a defendant; these cases are almost always decided by a jury; punishment for serious charges often consists of imprisonment but may also include a fine paid to the government; to secure conviction, the prosecution must establish the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt; and defendants are protected against conduct by police or prosecutors which violates their constitutional rights, including the right against the Fourth Amendment of unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fifth Amendment the right against compelled self-incrimination (Duignan, 2018).</p><p>An example where a single wrongful act may constitute both a public offense and a private injury and be both criminal and civil charges is the O.J. Simpson case.  In 1995, Mr. Simpson was acquitted of having murdered his wife and her friend, but two years later he was found liable for their killings in a civil suit for wrongful death (Duignan, 2018).</p><p><strong>State Court System</strong></p><p><a id="_Hlk517605539"></a>Many state courts are scaled down versions of federal courts.  State laws and state constitutions determine the make up on each state court system.  The jurisdiction of a state court resides within the boundaries of the respective state.  The highest court is the State Supreme Court, some states have a Court of Appeals, state trial courts are also known as Circuit or District Courts depending on the state (United States Courts, 2018).  States also have specific courts to hear certain cases examples are probate court, juvenile court, criminal courts, and family courts.  Selection of these State Court judges is handled in many ways, methods are elections, appointment for a specific timeframe, life, or a combination of these methods (United States Courts, 2018).</p><p><strong>Federal Court System</strong></p><p>The federal court system is based on a multi-level structure of U.S. District Courts, U.S. Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, these courts are delineated according to specific geographic areas spread across the country.  The U.S. District Courts are the trial courts, there are 94 of these courts, next is the U. S. Court of Appeals comprised of 13 circuits and the court of all courts and final stop for any legal case in the country is the U.S. Supreme Court (United States Courts, 2018).  Within the federal court system are also specialized courts like Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Tax Court (United States Courts, 2018).  All individuals selected to a federal level court are experts in the criminal justice field, appointed for life by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  Titles very for these individuals, at the Supreme Court level, the individuals are called justices, at the Circuit Court and District Court level the individuals are called judges (United States Department of Justice, 2018).  The number of individuals sitting on the benches at the federal court level varies, the District Court level has at least one judge, the Circuit Courts have as few as 6 to as many as 29 judges, the Supreme Court has one chief justice and eight associate justices (United States Department of Justice, 2018).</p><p>This paper looked at two types of laws, civil and criminal laws in the U.S. and compared the structure of the state and federal court systems.  Many people believe we do not have the</p><p>References</p><ul><li>Duignan, B.

Leave was granted on the submissions that the High Court Division failed to appreciate the case of the defendant appellant; the appellate court found that the findings of the trial court were inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the auction sale; the High Court</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Division without any basis whatsoever held that the conditions as incorporated in the auction sale document is against natural justice, the High Court Division without arriving at any finding to the effect that the appellate Court failed to consider the evidence on record reversed the findings of facts of the appellate court, the last court of facts, which are very much based on appreciation of the evidence on record.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellate court, on proper appreciation of the evidence on record reversed the finding of the trial court to the effect that the defendant no.l in his deposition did not deny the claim of the plaintiff and that the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Respondent submitted completion report on 31.3.1989 and that the plaintiff is not responsible for the trees stolen on a subsequent date from the surrounding area in as much as the above reasoning are clearly inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the auction sale; the appellate court reversed the finding of the trial court to the effect that the defendants should have initiated proceeding against the contiguous lot holder holding that the reasoning of the trial court in this regard being beyond pleading, the evidence in this regard were improperly admitted and the High court division reversed the above findings of the appellate court without proper appreciation of the material evidence on record; further the High Court Division did not al all consider the provisions of condition Nos. 21, 28 and 29 of the auction sale and that the above condition No. 21 provides that even after submission of the completion report the liability of the allottee exists for a period of two months and that in view of the provisions of condition Nos. 28 and 29 the plaintiff can not escape liability and further the points involved in the case are of great public importance as it involves allotments of forest land for cutting timber.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent submitted that the appellate court failed to consider that the plaintiff submitted completion report on 31.3.1989 and the trees were stolen on 12.4.1989 and accordingly the plaintiff had no liability in respect of the stolen trees; the stolen trees were recovered from the possession of one Ahammad Ullah, purchaser of adjacent Lot No. 10, but even then without initiating any proceeding against him and also against the purchasers of contiguous Lot Nos. 5, 7 and 8 cases were filed against the plaintiff; condition Nos. 21, 28 and 29 of the auction sale will not be applicable against the plaintiff at all in as much as in their written statement the defendants specifically pleaded that trees were stolen from Lot No. 9 which was allotted to the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 in his deposition stated that the trees were stolen from Lot No. 9 whereas under the terms of the auction sale the plaintiff, after cutting the trees from that lot, submitted completion report and there is nothing in the evidence on record that still there were suitable trees to be cut in that Lot; the appellate court committed error in holding that the deposition of P.Ws. 2 and 3 are beyond the pleadings specially when no such objection was raised in this regard at the time of taking their depositions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. As it appears the trial court decreed the suit on the findings, amongst others, that the plaintiff was not responsible for the loss alleged to have been caused due the cutting and taking away of the trees from the lot adjacent to his lot because he after cutting the trees from his own lot i.e. Lot No. 9. already submitted his completion report on 31.3.89, i.e. long before the alleged theft. But the appellate Court allowed the appeal holding that the reasons, based on which trial court decreed suit, are the not sustainable and if condition Nos. 21. 28 and 29 of auction sale are read together it will appear that the plaintiff, even after submission of the completion report, continued to be held liable for a period of at least two months as specified in condition No.21 and moreover condition Nos. 28 and 29 clearly show that the plaintiff is simultaneously held liable for the trees stolen from the unsold contiguous area and the intention for incorporating the above conditions in the terms of auction sale are that mere submission of the completion report does not end the liabilities of a purchaser of a lot and it is admitted by both sides that some trees detected the same on 12.4.89 and the defendants detected the same on 14.4.89 which ultimately led to the imposition of the fine upon the plaintiff in the two cases. The appellate Court further held that the first reasoning of the trial Court to the effect that the plaintiff submitted completion report on 31.3. 1989 in respect of Lot No. 9 and trees were stolen on 12.4.1989 and so the plaintiff is not responsible, is not correct in as much as the above reasoning contradicts condition Nos. 21. 28 and 29 of the auction sale and similarly the second reasoning of the trial court to the effect that the defendants should have initiated proceedings against the contiguous lot holders also appeared to be based on evidence improperly admitted because according to the condition No. 29 proceedings could also be initiated in respect of the lots which had not been sold and in the instant suit neither the plaintiff nor the defendants in their respective pleadings stated that the contiguous lots had been sold to any one before the timbers were stolen and the plaintiff, who deposed as P.W.I. is silent as to whether the contagious land has been sold to any person and that P.W.2. the clerk of the plaintiff, in his deposition stated that the stolen trees were found with the purchaser of Lot No. 10 and similarly P.W.3, a truck driver, stated that the trees in question were stolen away from lot No. 10 which had been sold to one Nurul Amin and the above statements admitted and hence cannot be relied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. However as it appears the High Court Division made the Rule absolute holding that in the instant case the plaintiff has done more than that was necessary by reporting the theft on 13.4.89 but no action was taken and simply a case was initiated in 14.4.1989, the next date, and therefore the plaintiff cannot be held responsible for the loss due to cutting and taking away of the trees specially when nowhere within the four corners of the case filed on 14.4.1989 there is any allegation that the plaintiff himself committed the theft or in what way or manner the plaintiff is connected with the alleged theft and moreover the appellate court has not reverted the finding of the trial court as required under Order 41 Rule 31 of the C.P.C. The High Court Division further held that because of non reading and misreading of the evidence on record the judgment of the appellate court suffers from illegality and the learned Assistant Attorney General also failed to convince the Court that the fine can be legally imposed upon the plaintiff in terms of the agreement of lease. It also appears the appellate Court failed to appreciate that the even though the stolen trees were recovered from the possession of Ahmedullah. the purchaser of Lot No. 10. no case was filed against Ahmeduullah and further no cases were also filed against the purchasers of the contiguous plots.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. Accordingly we are of the view that the High Court Division on proper consideration of the evidence and the materials on record made the Rule absolute. The learned counsel for the appellant also could not point out any illegality or infirmity in the decision of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">High Court Division so as to call for any interference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with cost.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Source: IV ADC (2007), 292</strong></p></div></div>
