Recognizing the significance of this loss, the international community adopted the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (CCP). A Protocol dealing with</p><p style="text-align: justify;">cultural property during times of occupation (P1) was adopted at the same time as the 1954 Convention. Although the 1954</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convention strengthens protection for cultural property, its provisions have not been implemented consistently. To address this</p><p style="text-align: justify;">problem, a second Protocol to the 1954 Convention (P2) was adopted on 26 March 1999. In addition to these instruments, the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1977 Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions include provisions protecting cultural property (Protocol I, Art. 38, 53 and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">85, and Protocol II, Art. 16).

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>2010 Review Conferance of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</p><p>19 March 2010</p><p>Original: English</p><p>10-28119 (E) 300310</p><p>*1028119*</p><p>New York, 3-28 May 2010</p><p>Memorandum on activities relating to the South Pacific</p><p>Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga)</p><p>Submitted by the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat</p><p>Introduction</p><p>1. The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga) was signed</p><p>at Rarotonga, Cook Islands, on 6 August 1985, and entered into force on</p><p>11 December 1986.</p><p>2. The Treaty is based on broad principles for Pacific countries to:</p><p>(a) Be free to live in peace and independence and to run their own affairs, in</p><p>accordance with the wishes and traditions of their people;</p><p>(b) Enjoy peaceful, social and economic development free from the threat of</p><p>environmental pollution;</p><p>(c) Acknowledge existing international treaties, organizations and regional</p><p>arrangements, such as the Charter of the United Nations, the Treaty on the</p><p>Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the United Nations Convention on the</p><p>Law of the Sea, which contribute to these principles;</p><p>(d) Act in accordance with applicable international principles and treaties,</p><p>notably the Non-Proliferation Treaty, with respect to nuclear activities;</p><p>(e) Take account of other regional arrangements;</p><p>(f) Retain their unqualified sovereign rights to decide their security</p><p>arrangements for themselves, consistent with their support for these principles.</p><p>3. The Treaty of Rarotonga has been signed and ratified by 13 Forum members</p><p>within the original geographical boundaries of the Treaty, namely Australia, Cook</p><p>Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,</p><p>Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The States parties to the Treaty and</p><p>the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat maintain close working relations with the</p><p>Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau, which joined the</p><p>Pacific Islands Forum after the establishment of the Treaty of Rarotonga. Although</p><p>NPT/CONF.2010/7</p><p>10-28119 2</p><p>currently not parties to the Treaty, it is expected that, in time, these countries will</p><p>also become parties to the Treaty of Rarotonga.</p><p>4. The Treaty of Rarotonga represents a unified approach by the States members</p><p>of the Forum in fulfilling their commitments under article VII of the</p><p>Non-Proliferation Treaty. It also represents a significant achievement and</p><p>contribution of the Pacific Islands Forum to ongoing efforts to strengthen global</p><p>security and the international non-proliferation regime. Regional treaties such as the</p><p>Treaty of Rarotonga provide valuable support and strength to the Non-Proliferation</p><p>Treaty, as well as opportunities to enhance coordination and cooperation among</p><p>nuclear-weapon-free zones, in support of the process of nuclear disarmament, with</p><p>the ultimate goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons.</p><p>5. The States members of the Forum are deeply committed to world peace and</p><p>security, and have renounced the manufacture, acquisition and possession of nuclear</p><p>explosive devices. They are determined to keep the Pacific region free of</p><p>environmental pollution from radioactive waste and other radioactive matter, and</p><p>seek, from the nuclear-weapon States, a commitment not to conduct nuclear tests in</p><p>the South Pacific.</p><p>The Treaty of Rarotonga</p><p>6. The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga) was the</p><p>second such treaty in the world. Its area of application ranges from the west coast of</p><p>Australia to the Latin American nuclear free zone in the east and from just north of</p><p>the equator to the Antarctic Treaty area. Together with the Treaty of Tlatelolco,</p><p>which covers Latin America, and the Antarctic Treaty, the Treaty of Rarotonga</p><p>covers contiguously a very significant portion of the globe. This coverage was</p><p>greatly increased by the Treaty of Bangkok of December 1995, which created a</p><p>nuclear free zone for South-East Asia, and by the Treaty of Pelindaba of April 1996,</p><p>which created a similar zone for Africa.</p><p>7. The Treaty contains a preamble, 16 articles and 4 annexes. Under its terms, the</p><p>parties undertake:</p><p>(a) Not to manufacture or otherwise acquire, possess or have control over</p><p>any nuclear explosive device by any means anywhere inside or outside the South</p><p>Pacific Nuclear Free Zone; the term “nuclear explosive device” is used rather than</p><p>“nuclear weapon” to emphasize that the parties do not draw a distinction between</p><p>devices that have military purposes and those for which a peaceful purpose is</p><p>claimed;</p><p>(b) To prevent the testing of nuclear explosive devices and to prevent the</p><p>stationing of nuclear explosive devices in their territory;</p><p>(c) To take measures, including the application of full-scope International</p><p>Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, to all peaceful nuclear activities in their territory</p><p>and to prevent the diversion of fissionable material to non-peaceful purposes;</p><p>(d) Not to dump radioactive waste and other radioactive matter at sea in the</p><p>Zone, to prevent the dumping of such waste or matter by anyone, and to take no</p><p>action to assist or encourage dumping.</p><p>NPT/CONF.2010/7</p><p>3 10-28119</p><p>8. The Treaty of Raratonga does not interfere with the right of each State party to</p><p>decide for itself whether to allow visits by foreign ships and aircraft to its ports and</p><p>airfields. It also explicitly upholds the freedom of navigation on the high seas and</p><p>territorial waters guaranteed by international law.</p><p>9. The Treaty also provides for a comprehensive control system to verify parties’</p><p>compliance with the Treaty, including procedures for the investigation of any</p><p>complaints that may be made regarding the breach of Treaty obligations. There are</p><p>also provisions for review, amendment and withdrawal, and for the boundaries of</p><p>the Zone to be extended as further countries join the Forum and become parties to</p><p>the Treaty.</p><p>The Protocols</p><p>10. The implementation of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty is enhanced</p><p>by three Protocols that were opened for signature in 1986. Through these Protocols,</p><p>nuclear-weapon States have undertaken to apply the Treaty of Rarotonga to their</p><p>territories in the Pacific region (Protocol 1); to refrain from the use or threat of use</p><p>of nuclear explosive devices against any party (Protocol 2); and not to test any</p><p>nuclear explosive devices within the Zone (Protocol 3).</p><p>11. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China signed Protocols 2 and 3 in</p><p>1986 and 1987 respectively, and ratified both in 1988. Neither the Union of Soviet</p><p>Socialist Republics nor China has territories in the Zone that would require</p><p>adherence to Protocol 1. France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern</p><p>Ireland and the United States of America signed Protocols 1, 2 and 3 on 25 March</p><p>1996. France ratified the Protocols in 1996 and the United Kingdom in 1997. The</p><p>United States has yet to ratify the Protocols.</p><p>Forum secretariat activities</p><p>12. The Forum secretariat continues to promote the Treaty of Rarotonga and to</p><p>monitor national, regional and global developments relevant to the non-proliferation</p><p>of nuclear weapons. It also remains in contact with the secretariats of other nuclear</p><p>free zones in relation to relevant developments and joint activities.</p></div></div>

Its population density is one of the highest, surpassed only by the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong. Natural disasters such as floods, droughts and cyclones are regular features in the life of Bangladeshis, as is political turmoil. Though during the last two decades Bangladesh made strong strides in socio economic developments, nonetheless, Bangladesh still remains one of the least developed countries of the world. 25 million people (19.23% of the total population) live in extreme poverty, and the incidence of poverty is worst among the women. In every respect, ranging from health and education to nutrition and income, women are the poorest of the poor. Bangladesh is one of the two unique countries of the world where life expectancy of women is lower than that of men. Given the size of its population, the ratio of population to arable land, the overall level of economic development and the increased number of women looking for avenues to earn a livelihood, there are ample reasons why various forms of migration forced and voluntary, internal and international, might occur in Bangladesh. And taking the opportunity of this situation and possibility of netting a big cache, it is not unlikely that traffickers shall tend to fish out this stream.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Women and children trafficking is a national as well as global problem. For the last two-three years trafficking in women and children has so alarmingly increased that it has become a matter of great concern for the peace loving people of our country as well the government. Trafficking in women and children is undoubtedly a heinous crime against humanity. In fact women and children of downtrodden families who are unemployed and live below the subsistence level are the victim of trafficking as they are being allured for better job and remuneration abroad. Trafficked women and children are employed in unsocial, undignified tedious and risky job. Women are forced to the nasty profession like prostitution and children are used as camel jockeys.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Trafficking in women and children is one of the fastest growing criminal activities in the world, behind drugs and arms.<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> A report recently published by US Department of State has revealed that most of the trafficking incidents have occurred in South and South-East Asia, East-Europe, Latin America and in the poverty-stricken Africa. About one million women and children are trafficked every year from these regions to the west and other places.<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Trafficking in women and children within the territory of Bangladesh is also a common phenomenon. Uneducated and vulnerable woman and children deprived of financial, legal and social support and opportunities easily become victims of internal and cross border trafficking. The organized gangs of traffickers are targeting the poorest of the poor and disadvantaged women in the rural areas of the country. The victims are either abducted or allured with promises of better life by providing lucrative job or marriage offers and false proposals to visit holy places. But, practically, they become the victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and eventually embrace a life of agony and torture. Sometimes, their valuable organs are also taken away for rescuing other’s life in the clinics of different countries including India.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the Bangladeshi women are sold in the brothels or forcibly engaged in prostitution or in cage brothels in the receiving countries like India, Pakistan and different Middle Eastern country. The victims who are forced into prostitution or brothels are the high-risk group for being HIV positive, and having AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.<a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> According to the information revealed by various studies and observations of different organizations, the prostitution or the brothels in Mumbai, India are the most high-risk areas for HIV and AIDS contamination.<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is a grave concern for the human community that 70% of them are women, aged between 14 to 24 and that each of them is abused sexually five times in a day. So, first of all it can be considered as a violation of human rights and secondly as a way of spreading HIV across the globe.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, the trafficking of women and children has increased in Bangladesh and in other Asian countries. But little efforts have been made to gain a meaningful understanding of the local dynamics of the problem. The task is difficult and involves delving into a complex area of legal issues, social attitudes, economic interests, and illicit activities. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the causes and consequences of trafficking is essential for any future interventions to combat this human problem, both nationally and internationally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite a large number of reports and considerable media coverage on trafficking, very few systematic research studies were conducted on trafficking. The available information on community members’ perceptions of trafficking and on the underlying determinants of trafficking, for example, is limited. Similarly, the experiences of organizations working to prevent trafficking and to assist trafficked people have not been adequately documented to identify appropriate interventions for improving the effectiveness of current efforts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This review was undertaken to produce a comprehensive summary of available information concerning trafficking of women and children in Bangladesh. Information on the magnitude of the problem, the underlying factors that foster trafficking, modes of trafficking, major trafficking routes, and consequences of trafficking has been compiled. The review also highlights the current activities of different non-government organizations (NGOs) to address the trafficking problem. This document is expected to contribute to the greater understanding of the trafficking issues, and provide a framework for future studies on program needs and research gaps on this issue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.2 Scope and objects</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a woman who could be a man’s mother, sister, daughter or wife, who is given the equal constitutional rights with man, who is equally fit to run the state activities like a man and who is intellectually no less fit than a man in other spheres of life is being sold and purchased like cows, goats and sheep away from her natal home in gross violation of human rights; she is being taken to unknown far off places for being used either as a cheap labour or mainly as sex worker. This trading in women has of late stirred the wisdom of the world and throughout the world this shameless abuse of humanity has raised a voice to save the woman wherever she may be and whatever may be her caste, creed or religion by enacting new laws or updating the old ones and applying them through courts and tribunals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This socially, politically and economically deplorable condition of women and recent world wisdom effect to improve their position and fate in society through motivation, legislation and awareness which have prompted me to undertake for investigating this socio-legal human problem of women of Bangladesh, India and Nepal and view it from the point of law and its practices in these countries. Trafficking in women is an international event, which has a long history. According to Indian Sociologist Bela Duttagupta, during the British rule, women from Europe, Australia and China were even trafficked to Indian sub-continent. There was also inter-border trafficking within the continent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, trafficking in women is an integral part of international migration. According to human rights activists:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Demand from economically advanced countries for cheap labour created another foreign earning [<i>sic</i>] strategy of developing countries by promoting a labour export policy. The unequal sexual division of labour at the national and international labour market makes it difficult for women to get employment in the formal sector within and outside their country. Jobs available for women are either as domestic helpers or sex workers in the international market. The limited opportunities for women in overseas employment do not correlate to the number of women who want to work. Thus, there is a surplus of women who in turn become victims of unscrupulous recruiting agencies and human traffickers. Though trafficking in women also exists in western developed countries, it is more serious in developing one. Petro-dollars of Middle-East influence trafficking in women from South Asian countries, especially Bangladesh, India and Nepal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are some motives behind the incidence of trafficking in women. These are: to sell women into prostitution, to engage them in bonded labour, to remove their kidneys and sell them in the underground organ markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.3 Context</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This section briefly describes the context of trafficking from the global, regional and Bangladesh perspectives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i> <b>1.3.1 Global context</b>: </i>Trafficking of persons into bonded sweatshop labour, forced marriage, forced prostitutions, domestic servitude, and other kinds of work is a global phenomenon that takes place within countries and regions and on a transcontinental scale. Trafficking in women is one of the fastest growing criminal activities in the world with an estimated one to two million young women being trafficked annually for the purpose of forced labor, domestic servitude, or sexual exploitation. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that, in 1995, about 500,000 women were trafficked to the countries of the European Union from poorer regions of the world<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> . So, it is not a problem of developing countries alone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although the concept of trafficking is often used for describing kidnapping and enslavement of women for the commercial sex industry, different government and international agencies have adopted much broader definitions of the term to include other forms of trafficking and affected groups, such as children trafficked for child labor and organ donation. The problem is usually under-reported because of the difficulties involved in tracking such clandestine activities. In recent years, the issues relating to trafficking have become more prominent and are being discussed more openly. There are more efforts also to understand the underlying dynamics of trafficking of women and children.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This may be related to increase awareness and concerns about human rights, violence against women, and about the role of commercial sex in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related epidemics. The question of trafficking has figured prominently in the agenda of recent international meetings, such as International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, World Summit for Social Development in 1995, and Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing in 1995.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, there is also a growing interest among the policy-makers and program managers to identify effective options for preventing such exploitation of women and children and in designing appropriate interventions for them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i> 1.3.2 Regional context: </i></b>Trafficking in Asia accounts for a large share of the global volume of trafficked women and children. In the last two decades, the number of trafficked women and children in Asia has increased alarmingly. Trafficking across borders was included as an important issue in the ninth South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit in May 1997.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In its 27th paragraph, the Declaration of the 9<sup>th</sup> SAARC Summit says, “Expressing grave concern at the trafficking of women and children within and between countries, the Heads of State or Government pledged to coordinate their efforts and take effective measures to address this problem.” They decided that the existing legislation(s) in Member States should be strengthened and strictly enforced. This should include simplification of the repatriation procedures for victims of trafficking.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Trafficking of women has been the part of the tradition in this region. In his review, Joardar found that the problem of prostitution is directly related to trafficking of women, and this institution has been in existence in this region in the nineteenth and early twentieth century<a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>. Mukherjee reported that, during village melas (fair), many village girls were lost and misled into brothels<a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>. A second study titled ‘Prostitution in historical and modern perspectives’, based on fieldwork was conducted in eight brothels in and around Kolkata by Joardar, who observed that prostitution was related with low castes. Also, the findings of Joardar on many women originally belonging to Bangladesh and other neighboring countries indicate the existence of a regional ‘circulation’ of prostitution, and the regional trafficking of women was historical<a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> . In another study, Khan and Arefeen also observed some unique features in Jessore brothel, which are specific to a border town that has various kinds of business and cultural links with the adjacent Indian region<a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">South Asia is considered the most vulnerable region for trafficking because of its large population, large-scale rural-urban migration, large populations living in conditions of chronic poverty, and recurrent natural disasters. Women and children are sold, traded, exchanged for sexual slavery and prostitution, and bonded labour across borders, such as from Bangladesh to India, Pakistan, and the Middle East; from Nepal to India; from Burma to Thailand; from Vietnam to Kampuchea; and from the Philippines to Japan. Table 1 shows distribution of Asian countries between which trafficking takes place. The table shows the major sending and receiving countries in the Asian region. Some sending</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Countries are as well receiving countries and vice versa.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>1.3.3 Bangladesh context</i></b><i>: </i>Causes and consequences of trafficking in Bangladesh cannot be understood in isolation from its historical, cultural, geographical and socioeconomic perspectives and the present condition of women.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>1.3.3.1 Historical and geographical contexts</i></b><i>:</i>After independence from British colonization in 1947, the Indian sub-continent was divided into two countries: India and Pakistan. Pakistan had two distinct geographic regions, East Pakistan and West Pakistan, separated by 1,200 miles. Thus, many cross-border families were formed. During separation, many Muslim families from India migrated to Pakistan, particularly to East Pakistan. Again, many Hindus living in East Pakistan moved to India. In 1971, East Pakistan became independent from West Pakistan and a new nation, Bangladesh, was born. During this time, many non-Bengali Pakistanis (who were originally from India) wanted to go back to West Pakistan and are still awaiting repatriation to Pakistan. They live in 66 camps scattered in 14 districts of Bangladesh. As repatriation of these people has been delayed, many cross land-borders illegally. Often with these groups, other women and children are trafficked On both sides of the newly-drawn border between India and Pakistan and India and Bangladesh, there are many ‘enclaves’ which are pockets of land belonging to a nation other than that which surrounds them. There are 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 enclaves of Bangladesh in India. Usually, these areas are not patrolled or controlled by any law-enforcing agencies. Research by the BNWLA has shown that these enclaves have been used as recruitment and collection sites by traffickers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>1.3.3.2 Socio-economic context:</i></b>Bangladesh, one of the most densely-populated countries in the world, has 147,570 sq km of land and a population density of 755 per sq km. The present estimated population of the country is about 129 million. Despite the achievements of some poverty-alleviation programmers through micro-credit and other development initiatives, the vast majority of the populations in Bangladesh still live in poverty. Illiteracy and unemployment are quite high.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Recurrent natural disasters make the situation more critical for the entire population. During distress situation, lack of shelter for girls is a great problem. All these factors make women and children vulnerable, and make them easy targets of traffickers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> <i>1.3.3.3 Cultural context</i></b><i>: </i>If socioeconomic conditions present a context of persisting poverty and if underdevelopment affects large numbers of the population, this situation is most acutely felt by women, because they additionally face strong religious, historic and cultural forces that tend to shape every aspect of their lives. Legally, both women and men have the same rights and are entitled to equal treatment under the law. Nevertheless, cultural norms often act as barriers to the implementation of egalitarian legislation. For example, due to male preference, females suffer not only nutritional neglect, but also receive less attention during sickness than males. Arranged marriages are the norm, and young women are still married relatively early in life<a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> . The most recent Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) reported that about 60% of women aged 10-49 years were married by the time they were aged 15 years<a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> .</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Legal provisions to protect women and children from exploitation are also not enforced due to organizational inefficiency and the inadequate capacity of law-enforcing agencies. As a result, some social practices, which are detrimental to a woman’s status in society, still continue many decades after their legal abolition. A case in point is the practice of dowry, which continues despite national legislation against this, which was signed in 1980. The inability to fulfill commitments of dowry affects a young bride’s treatment by her husband’s relatives and increases her vulnerability of being abandoned and trafficked for immoral purposes or bonded labour.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1.4 Routes of trafficking</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are two common types of trafficking in Bangladesh: one is internal and the other is cross border trafficking. In the case of internal trafficking, women and children are often taken away from their homes through abduction, on false promise of a better life with good employment, by traffickers who in turn sell them in brothels and ship-breaking yards in Bangladesh. On the other hand, at the cross-border level, they are smuggled by the gang of traffickers to place them further destinations such as India, Pakistan and other Middle Eastern countries where their ultimate fate is a life of sexual exploitation, abuse and other forms of bonded labour. Tiny boys, who are trafficked to the Middle–East mostly, become camel-jockeys, which is a very risky and hazardous job.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to a study conducted by the Bangladesh National Women’s Lawyer’s Association, in 250 villages in different parts of the country in 1999, every year a total of 7000 women and children become victim of cross-border trafficking. The real number is much higher, and could not be ascertained due to the absence of studies covering currently all the districts of the country. Besides, a large number of women and children are trafficked every year within this territory. In addition, it has been identified that almost all of the 1.6 million garment-worker-girls and young women are the vulnerable groups that can easily become victim of internal and cross-border trafficking at any time.<a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The networks of traffickers in Bangladesh are well organized with different settings of people like local political leaders, smugglers, anti-social activists and somehow law-enforcement personnel also.<a name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> The traffickers take advantage of Bangladesh’s sizable borders to transport the women, often using large criminal networks and deceptive tactics to avoid detection and prosecution. It has been revealed from an interview with a local journalist that the victims of trafficking are taken and measured as a coin of exchange between the traders of India and Bangladesh. For example, if any valuable goods are smuggled from India to Bangladesh, the Bangladeshi smugglers make their payment by trafficking women and children instead of sending natural currency. This is because, it is paving the way for another illegal and profitable business, and saving the time, space and energy in exchanging the natural currency between the two countries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are large networks of traffickers working at the national level and across borders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Normally, a group of traffickers collects victims from Bangladesh, and hands them over to their counterparts in India or Myanmar. From there, these agents take them to the Batrigach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bangladesh is mainly a country of origin for trafficking in women and children. A reported 200,000 Bangladeshi women and children have been taken out of the country in the past 10 years.<a name="_ftnref15"></a><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> At least 20,000 Bangladeshi women and children are trafficked to India and Pakistan and to Middle Eastern countries every year.<a name="_ftnref16"></a><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a> According to another estimate, 50,000 Bangladeshi girls are trafficked to or through India every year. The girls end up in brothels in India or Pakistan or in Middle Eastern or South Asian countries.<a name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> Women are also trafficked to Australia. Internal trafficking in women and children occurs from rural areas of the country to the capital, Dhaka.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter</b> <b>2</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>TRAFFICKING AND BANGLADESH</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.1 DEFINITION</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this chapter denotes what is trafficking and it’s natures. How trafficking problem is internalized. Trafficking means illegal transfer of women and children from one place to another. The crux of the issue is that civil society in Bangladesh is yet to internalize the mindset that trafficking and flesh trade are as bad as murder, rape, or mugging. Trafficking, which is a serious problem and is considered a violation of human rights, is yet to be internalized emotionally by society at large in Bangladesh and also in other South Asian countries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The main purpose of definition of trafficking is to understand what it is? I describe the term women trafficking in a various ways, such as Bangladesh perspective as well as international perspectives. I describe the definition of women trafficking with Bangladesh perspectives from my own thought and from various N.G.O. of Bangladesh and others sources. I describe the trafficking with Bangladesh perspectives because the purpose of this research is to understand about women trafficking in view of Bangladesh. It helps to find out us the nature of trafficking in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I define women trafficking from various international organizations, such as U.N. General Assembly, Global Alliance against Trafficking in Women (GAATW), International Organization for Migrations (IOM), The International Labor Organization (ILO), USAID, etc. Those definitions may help us to know about the nature of women trafficking as an international crime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2.2</b> <b>Definitions</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The definition of trafficking continues to be the subject of debate, and there is no conclusive or even commonly agreed upon definition globally, regionally or even nationally. This in itself is indicative of the degree of ideological contention which marks the discourse on trafficking and related issues. Absence of consensus on the definition has crucial implications on strategic planning and programmer development since some of the definitions which inform concrete practice may be contradictory to each other. However, there are some basic elements of trafficking that are widely agreed upon, such as violence, deception, coercion, deprivations of freedom of movement, abuse of authority, debt bondage, forced labor and slavery-like practices, and other forms of exploitation or use of force.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i> 2.2.1</i></b><i> <b>Bangladesh Perspective</b></i>: The people of Bangladesh individually and collectively consider trafficking particularly trafficking in women and children as a heinous crime. From time immemorial, people in this deltaic region of Bengal have been living peacefully and united.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The social fabric and family network was so strong that people used to live in societies with strong sense of belongingness and security. But after independence, many things, many norms and customs have changed. With the passage of time, people saw gradual decline in the role and efficacy of social institutions, its command and applicability. The hard realities of life, harsh economic conditions and access to information and education have shattered the myths in societies and bonds of families. In the threshold of a new century traditional, age-old values were swept away by surge of modern individualistic values, that prefers individualism to collectivism, profit to charity and richness to egalitarian societies. Thus social values and family bonds that have for so long knotted our society into a solid rock were now partially or fully discarded. Consequently, women and children who were protected by the social safety network of our family and society are now no more treated so. They are left to the mercy of open market, which is usually throat cut and ruthless. Profit is the only driving force here and it determined the price of women and child, which appeared to be very lucrative.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Bangla equivalent of the word trafficking is pachar. It has a mild connotation, which means transfer from one place to another. If the term pachar is used in reference to women and children, in Bangla the phrase nari o shishu pachar means illegal transfer of women and children from one place to another. Trafficking, which is a serious problem and is considered a violation of human rights, is yet to be internalized emotionally by society at large in Bangladesh and also in other South Asian countries. The term itself does not capture the total implications for an adolescent girl to be abducted and taken to a brothel; threatened, beaten, and raped; and forced to submit to having sex with men, seven days a week, for several years until she eventually becomes ill which may sometime result in death.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The crux of the issue is that civil society in Bangladesh has yet to internalize the mind-set that ‘trafficking’ is as bad as murder, rape, or mugging. When one hears or reads news about trafficking, it does not create the same reaction as other criminal activities, such as rape, murder, or mugging. Newspapers are replete with news of rape and murder, but there are few reports on trafficking of women and children. It may be because trafficking happens behind the scenes and is hard to detect. Both print and electronic media could be used for playing a more effective role in depicting different facets of trafficking in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the NGO level, it has been observed that, although there is no disagreement regarding the seriousness of the problem, there are differences on how they internalize the problem. Some NGO representatives think that awareness about trafficking issues in Bangladesh is different when compared to other crimes. The expression was as follows: “generally, people are not treating trafficking equally with other types of offences, those who are conscious can easily relate trafficking with murder and rape, since murder and rape are crimes of such a nature which has an urgency, the reaction is quick and immediate, whereas trafficking takes place through a process behind the scenes and occurs over a period of time, so people do not have any immediate reaction”<a name="_ftnref18"></a><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a> Another respondent representing an NGO looked at trafficking as a part of migration process, but was bothered by violence and illegal activities associated with trafficking. She stated, “Trafficking is a kind of migration. One can go anywhere s/he likes. It is a fundamental human right. People are going from one place to another for a long, long time. But when people are taken illegally through deception and are tortured, it becomes an issue. So, violence and illegal activities associated with trafficking should be stopped”<a name="_ftnref19"></a><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a> Shamim pointed out that the word trafficking does not carry the sense of violence, such as murder or rape. She thinks that people are yet to incorporate this, although trafficking should be considered the worst form of exploitation. She highlighted another facet of the problem which is hat the outcome of traffickers is not well-understood, since there is little documentation of what happens to women and children after they are trafficked to a place.<a name="_ftnref20"></a><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>2.2.2 International Perspective</i></b><i>: </i>International organizations use various definitions for describing trafficking. The definitions tend to focus on gender, age, reason for trafficking, and the issues of coercion and violence which are often associated with trafficking. In the case of children, in 1998, a research report by Archavanitkul<a name="_ftnref21"></a><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a> titled “Trafficking in Children for Labour Exploitation including Child Prostitution in the Mekong Sub-region”, compared definitions used by the UN General Assembly, Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women (GAATW), International Organization for Migrations (IOM), and the International Labour Organization (ILO).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After considering these definitions, the authors concluded that important dimensions of child trafficking include the performance of a profitable act by person(s) other than the children themselves who transport a child within or across the national borders usually using false or deceptive information for the purpose of work or services in destructive and exploitative work conditions by means of violence, abuse, or other forms of coercion. For their study, a trafficked child refers to “A child who is recruited and transported from one place to another across a national border, legally or illegally, with or without the child’s consent, usually but not always organized by an intermediary: parents, family member, teacher, procurer, or local authority. At the destination, the child is coerced or semi-forced (by deceptive information) to engage in activities under exploitative and abusive conditions”<a name="_ftnref22"></a><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of women, the same dimensions seem to be important. For instance, the US President’s Interagency Council on Women, defines trafficking as: “All acts involved in the recruitment, transport, harboring or sale of persons within national or across international borders through deception or fraud, coercion or force, or debt bondage for purposes of placing persons in situations of forced labor or services, such as forced prostitution or sexual services, domestic servitude, or other forms of slavery-like practices”.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, the Global Alliance against Trafficking in Women considers that trafficking of women refers to “all acts involved in the recruitment and/or transportation of a woman within and across national borders for work or services by means of violence or threat of violence, abuse of authority or dominant position, debt-bondage, deception or other forms of coercion”<a name="_ftnref23"></a><a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a>. Friedman, USAID, referred the following definition “The recruitment of girls/women by means of violence or threat, debt bondage, deception or coercion to act as sex workers under menace of penalty and for which the individual has not offered themselves voluntarily”<a name="_ftnref24"></a><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although prostitution is an important outcome of trafficking activities, there are many other exploitative outcomes and events relating to trafficking. Thus, definitions tend to be general and encompass not only the sex and age of the trafficked persons, but also the different purposes for which people are trafficked. The countries of SAARC have a definition in their Convention for Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children. Nevertheless, a consultation workshop organized by the Resistance Network in Bangladesh in August 1999 made suggestions for changes to the convention. The workshop proposed the following definitions:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Trafficking in women consists of all acts involved in the procurement, transportation, forced movement, and/or selling and buying of women within and/or across border by fraudulent means, deception, coercion, direct and/or indirect threats, abuse of authority, for the purpose of placing a woman against her will without her consent in exploitative and abusive situations such as forced prostitution, forced marriage, bonded and forced labour, begging, organ trade, etc.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“Trafficking in children consists of all acts involved in the procurement, transportation, forced movement, and/or selling and buying of children within and/or across border by fraudulent means, deception, coercion, direct and/or indirect threats, abuse of authority, for the purpose of placing a woman against her will without her consent in exploitative and abusive situations, such as commercial sexual abuse, forced marriage, bonded and forced labour, begging, camel jockeying and other sports, organ trade, etc.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shamim internalized trafficking in children in its broad perspective, which included all acts involved in capture, acquisition, recruitment and transportation of children within and across national borders with the intent to sell, exchange, or use for any illegal purposes, such as prostitution, servitude in the guise of marriage, bonded labour, or sale of human organs by means of violence or threat of violence<a name="_ftnref25"></a><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>2.2.3. Operational Definition</i></b>: In the context of Bangladesh, the BNWLA adapted the definition of the Global Alliance against Trafficking in Women, so that it could be applied to situations involving both women and children. Thus, the BNWLA defines trafficking as “All acts involved in the recruitment and/or transport of a woman (or child) within and across national borders for work or services (or marriage) by means of violence or threat of violence, abuse of authority or dominant position, debt bondage, deception or other forms of coercion”<a name="_ftnref26"></a><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a>. Arriving at an appropriate definition of the phenomenon of trafficking is essential for identifying the magnitude of the problem and ways to address it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Chapter 3</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES AND REMEDIES OF TRAFFICKING</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">International dimension of Poverty, lack of education and large families are three main factors for why trafficking has been able to flourish in this country. The causes of trafficking and factors leading to this apparent increases in recent years are multiple and complicated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now a days, globalization and materialism are also main factors behind this growing problem. In Bangladesh, due to increasing landlessness and inadequate investment in rural industrialization, the scope for employment opportunities and skill development, particularly for rural women, is less. Women have traditionally worked as unpaid family labourers in the society. And this is why; women are forced to migrate from rural areas to urban ones. This trend of migration creates vulnerable conditions for women and children, and provides opportunities to the traffickers to exploit women and children.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most reports emphasize that, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of children and women being trafficked from Bangladesh into India and other countries. The causes of trafficking and the factors leading to this apparent increases in recent years are multiple and complicated. These factors are embedded within the socioeconomic structure of the country and require an in-depth analysis. However, for the present purpose, the factors have been categorized into two groups. The first group, the ‘push’ factors, includes the conditions which are responsible for trafficking of people from one country to another country. These factors have been outlined in the previous discussion about Bangladesh and its regional context and will be expanded further below. The second group refers to the set of ‘pull’ factors that support the demand for trafficked victims<a name="_ftnref27"></a><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.1</b> <b>Causes of Trafficking</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are some economic and social problems which are responsible for women and children trafficking. These are as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.1 Poverty:</i></b>Poverty is one of the vital problems of our country. Poverty happens to be the prime factor behind woman and child trafficking from villages of the country’s frontier areas. At least 42% of our population lives below the subsistence level. Most of them live from hand to mouth and pass their days in hardship. Due to extreme poverty many of them prefer to go abroad for better life. About 22 percent of the total populations of the country are poor and destitute women. According to women affairs directorate, there are 17, 39,542 poor and destitute women in the country<a name="_ftnref28"></a><a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Worldwide, rising unemployment and the decline of government- sponsored social services, have contributed to severe poverty in the developing world and an increase in labor exploitation. Women bear the brunt of this economic instability. Desperate living conditions and the devaluation of women and girls, make them particularly vulnerable to trafficking. Families living in absolute poverty often lack the means to feed all of their children. Parents may decide to sell one child because they cannot afford to raise that child without risking the survival of every member of the family. In many places, girls are considered less valuable than boys, and are more likely to be sold.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> <i>3.2.2 Unemployment:</i></b> Bangladesh has been facing acute unemployment problem for a long time. Population is increasing in alarming rate where as job opportunities in our country are very limited. Traffickers are exploiting the situation and allured trafficked persons for employment abroad. The study shows that the organized gangs of traffickers take advantage of the crushing poverty of their victims and lure them away with prospects of job opportunities. The study said that about 90 per cent of the women were household workers or unemployed. Most of these victims were wed-locked with men who had very low incomes. Families of 61percent of victims were ‘landless’.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.3 Economic and Social Disparity:</i></b>In the prevailing economic system the poor are becoming poor and the rich are getting richer. The poor section of people is moving within the vicious cycle. As a result the number of landless and uprooted people in our country is increasing day by day. The uprooted and displaced people take shelter in different slums in cities and towns. They work as day labourer or servant in the houses. In the most of the cases they become the victim of human trafficking.Other major factors behind the trafficking have been identified as illiteracy, landlessness, and over-population and low levels of income.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.4 Overpopulation:</i></b>Overpopulation was one more important reason behind women and children trafficking in Bangladesh. According to the study, about 59 per cent of the victims came from big families, 25 per cent from medium sized families and only six per cent from small families.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.5</i></b><i> <b>Violence:</b> </i> Violence in the home, often linked to economic instability, can also make women and children more vulnerable to trafficking. Fearing for their safety, women and children often run away from situations of domestic violence. In search of shelter and food, they may become targets of trafficking agents who deceptively offer them security.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.6 Conflict:</i></b>Conflict and increasing militarization worldwide play a significant role in human trafficking. Traffickers often take advantage of the desperate conditions created by conflict, preying upon those living in refugee camps. The arrival of soldiers is often associated with a sudden rise in child prostitution and sex tourism, and an expansion of sex trafficking in the region.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.7</i></b><i> <b>Sluggish security system:</b> </i> The security system in our border, land, river, sea airport is not so strong and modernized. Because of sluggish security system the traffickers get easy access to fulfill their mission.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> <i>3.2.8</i></b><i> <b>Corruption of security and immigration personal:</b> </i>On many occasion security and immigration personnel are being bribed by human traffickers for which they allow the trafficked women and children to go abroad with false passport and visa.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3.2.9 Low employment opportunities</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladesh, due to increasing landlessness and inadequate investment in rural industrialization, the scope for employment opportunities and skill development, particularly for rural women, is less. Women have traditionally worked as unpaid family laborers in the society. Employment opportunities, access to land, and credit facilities have traditionally been limited for women. However, in recent years, there have been increasing demands on the labor of women and children in the urban informal sector, garments industry, and as domestic servants, and a growing number of women and children are involved in the workforce in the cities<a name="_ftnref29"></a><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a>. Data of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) show that, in general, the female labor force had reached 21.3% in 1996 compared to 6.1% in 1980<a name="_ftnref30"></a><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a>. Again, among adolescent girls aged 10 to 14 years, the labor force increased to 22.4% in 1996 compared to 11.1% in 1989<a name="_ftnref31"></a><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">[31]</a>. Thus, low employment opportunity for women in the rural areas and growing demand for workforce in the informal sector in the urban areas push women to migrate from rural areas to urban areas. This trend of migration creates vulnerable conditions for women and children and provides opportunities to traffickers to exploit women and children.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.10 Social vulnerability of women and female children</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Khan and Arefeen have looked at women’s subordinate position in our society from a feminist- anthropological perspective<a name="_ftnref32"></a><a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title="">[32]</a>. The authors observed that patriarchy with all its ideological manifestations plays a crucial role in creating a vulnerable situation for women in a changing socioeconomic setting. Patriarchy defines an asymmetrical role and relationship for men and women in the society, which has been termed as gender class by the feminists. In our society, men are considered economic providers and women their dependents whose role is related to biological reproduction. This creates specific gender roles with strong values and norms attached to each. On this again is built the ideology of sexuality whereby women’s sexuality has to be controlled by men. Again this notion of control and of protection of women leads to vulnerable exploitative situation for women in which the slightest sexual deviation or social dislocation makes them ‘polluted’ and object of social degradation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The socialization process in the family determines the role of a girl child as a future mother and wife. The girls grow up with a mentality of dependency in a male-dominant environment where their contributions toward the family are unrecognized as they perform the role of unpaid family help. Participation of girl children in household chores, both in rural and urban setup, is seen as a process of preparing them for marriage by teaching them of becoming efficient ‘house wives’. The girls are exposed to the risks of being victimized even at the family. Sometimes the girls’ living places pose threats to their safety. Often in rural areas and urban slums, they have to live in fragile huts. In a community-based study on socioeconomic dimension of trafficking of girl children, one girl who was from rural areas of Rajshahi expressed,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“I sleep in a room with my mother along with my two sisters. The condition of our house is not at all good. The fences and the bamboo-made walls of room have almost broken down. Therefore, my mother always worries about our safety and keeps watch throughout the night. I cannot sleep well out of fear and anxiety as well”<a name="_ftnref33"></a><a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title="">[33]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the urban slums, the risk of abuse of girl children within the family by the stepfather or the other family members is most fatal. For economic survival and social protection, the girls need to be submissive in such a family environment. They are exposed to constant threat of becoming sexually active not only because of the sexual aggression of men, but also by other provocative factors. For example, in urban slums, joint families comprising parents, daughters, sons, and daughters-in-law live in a tiny single room which is embarrassing for the adolescent girls, because there is no privacy. A girl of an urban slum expressed,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“As we are now old enough to understand, we feel very embarrassed to sleep in the same room where my parents and my brother with his wife sleep. I feel disgraced and ashamed, but there is no way out. After my brother got married, he did not have the ability to find a separate room for himself. If I had the ability to rent a separate room, I would have left this disgraced situation as early as possible”<a name="_ftnref34"></a><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">[34]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In rural communities, early marriage, dowry system, and polygamy are commonly- practiced phenomena. Young girls and women are often the victims of gender oppression due to their low status in society. To avoid social pressure and stigma regarding the delayed marriage of women, parents try to arrange a marriage for their daughters at an early age, even before the legal age of 18 years. Often these marriages are unregistered, because the parents are ignorant about the importance of registration of marriage. Thus, it is impossible to validate many marriages, and men are easily able to remarry. Dowry is also a common practice. Parents are often unable to marry off their daughters, because of their inability to pay a dowry. Sometimes the girls are married off to much older men to avoid the payment of dowry. This may lead to early widowhood, failure in conjugal life, or separation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Divorce and desertion frequently on grounds of non-payment of dowry or post-marital demands for dowry are encouraged by the sanction of polygamy. According to the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, men are required to obtain permission from the Union Parisad Chairman on the basis of consent from the first wife for remarrying. Men generally ignore this requirement, and if women resist, they are frequently abandoned<a name="_ftnref35"></a><a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="">[35]</a>. It has been found that both polygamy and dowry have led to an increased incidence of domestic violence and desertion. Sometimes physical and mental illnesses and contagious diseases result in women and girls becoming outcasts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In many instances, communities and families treat these single, widowed women as outcasts and as a social and economic burden. Hence, offers of marriage or employment prospects are tempting for them. Often frustration in love or failure in conjugal life pushes women toward the allure of a better life. A study of two unions in Rajshahi, conducted by the Association for Community Development, found that many young girl trafficked over land border were treated as a burden by their respective families, because they were unable to find paid work after they were deserted by their husbands<a name="_ftnref36"></a><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">[36]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.11</i></b><i> <b>Economic Vulnerability of Women and Children</b></i></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Bangladeshi society, women get the smallest share of resources. When resources are stretched thin, it is women; the most marginalized in the first place, who suffer first and most. The state policy intervention in the agricultural sector has resulted in strong polarization of classes. The new technologies introduced became the property of the rich. The poorest section of the population was marginalized. Men were forced to look for jobs outside agricultural labor, and women were left without any work at all. Consequently, women are being pushed to extreme marginal position. The general pauperization necessitated them to work for survival.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, they entered the highly competitive labor market where they are forced to compete with the dominant male labor force. In the process, they are left with little choice but to take up extremely low paid, exploitative work as domestic servants, garment factory workers, prostitutes, etc. A study reported that sometimes the parents forcefully engaged their girl children in odd jobs due to extreme economic hardship in urban slum areas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This study also found that the girls who earn in the slum are given ‘higher value’ as prospective brides, although they had little or no role in the process of deciding about their future<a name="_ftnref37"></a><a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">[37]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i> 3.2.12</i></b><i> <b>Urbanization and Migration</b>: </i>The population growth rate of urban areas is three times higher (6-7%) than the national population growth of 2% per year<a name="_ftnref38"></a><a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title="">[38]</a>. At present, about 20% (25 million) of the country’s total population of (129 million) live in the urban areas<a name="_ftnref39"></a><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="">[39]</a>. The growth of urban slums and the homeless population are some of the gravest challenges that the country is now encountering. The environmental and socioeconomic conditions in the slum and squatter settlements are extremely poor and, in fact, very hazardous. These conditions are health hazards to the residents of these settlements and to those living outside. The densities are very high (up to 2,000 persons or more per acre or 5,000 persons per hectare). The per-capita living space is terribly low, even down to 10 square feet (or 1 sq. meter) in some settlements<a name="_ftnref40"></a><a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title="">[40]</a>. Again, due to continuous in-migration of the illiterate rural poor and the increase in the number of the urban poor, the urban literacy rate has actually been declining and the total number of urban illiterates has also gone up from 1,389,000 in 1961 to 3,218,000 in 1974 and 5,429,000 in 1981<a name="_ftnref41"></a><a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="">[41]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">People are continuously migrating from rural to urban areas for economic and social reasons. A study, conducted by the Research Evaluation Associates for Development among vulnerable and floating groups of people in four cities of Bangladesh, reported that social factors are as important as economic factors for their vulnerability. However, this study observed that acute financial crisis, limited or no access to resources, unemployment, and crisis due to natural calamities are important economic factors for vulnerability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This study also identified that social factors, such as torture by husbands and other family members, torture (including rape in some cases) by miscreants and deception at the community level, deception regarding property by relatives, neighbors and influential men, deception by lovers and agents, remarriage of husband/wife, pressure of dowry, and infertility, including son preference, might have attributed in trafficking. When the rural poor migrate to cities, traffickers take chances and lure women and children for money and jobs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.2.13</i></b><i> <b>wage employment or bonded labor</b>: </i>There is an increasing demand for child labor for the sex trade, domestic work, and other exploitative events, because child labor is cheap and easily controlled. Bangladeshi children are engaged in construction sites, carpet trade, and glass bangles industries in Kolkata, Uttar Pradesh, and Karachi<a name="_ftnref42"></a><a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="">[42]</a>. In large cities, such as Karachi, it is not uncommon to find Bangladeshi women and children recruited as housemaids. Due to lack of identity papers, these women and children are often exploited and abused.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Camel racing is a profitable sport in some middle-eastern countries, particularly in Dubai. This requires lightweight jockeys, and has led to an increased trafficking of Bangladeshi boys, as young as five years old</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> <i>3.2.14</i></b><i> <b>Labor Migration and Prostitution</b>: </i>Very little information is available on labor migration of Bangladeshi women. Although women’s claim to work and to migrate transitionally is a legitimate human right, it is not officially recognized in Bangladesh. However, migrations of men and women have completely different dimensions because of differences in its implications and consequences. When men migrate and return to home country they are easily reintegrated. But, women are at risk of being stigmatized, particularly when they migrate alone. On the other hand, continued migration of men seeking employment in big cities within and outside the country leads to an increased demand for cheap and available sex. Often male migrant laborers desire sex workers who share a common linguistic and cultural background. This involves the migration of sex workers from the home country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> <i>3.2.15 Cultural Myths:</i></b> There are reports that one of the main causes of the increasing demand for young girls is the myth that intercourse with a virgin can cure a man of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and rejuvenate him. It is also a widely prevalent belief that sex with a female child does not expose a person to STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.3</i></b><i> <b>Modes of Trafficking and the Procurement Process:</b> </i>Trafficking in Bangladesh exists for the purposes of forced labor and forced prostitution. Although exact figures on the scope of the problem vary widely, the consensus is that the trafficking problem is growing rapidly. An estimated 90 percent of trafficked women were forced to engage in prostitution.<a name="_ftnref43"></a><a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[43]</a> Reportedly, 400,000 Bangladeshi women are engaged in forced prostitution in India, and 300,000 Bangladeshi boys have been trafficked to India.<a name="_ftnref44"></a><a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[44]</a> According to one report, every day 50 Bangladeshi girls are lured across the Indian border and sold. India shares 4,222 kilometers of its border with 28 districts of Bangladesh, and most of that border is open to traffic. Bangladeshi girls who are trafficked to India by organized networks usually end up in brothels in Kolkata or Mumbai.<a name="_ftnref45"></a><a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[45]</a> Many victims are raped by their traffickers or by Bangladeshi and Indian border patrol guards.<a name="_ftnref46"></a><a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title="">[46]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">An estimated 40,000 female children are exploited in Pakistani brothels. From January 2000 to June 2003, an estimated 2,405 Bangladeshi children disappeared. Of those, 510 boys and 451 girls were confirmed to have been trafficked<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title="">[47]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Street children living in the capital are among the prime targets of organized child-trafficking rings. According to some surveys, Pakistan and oil-rich Arab states are the principal destinations of Bangladeshi children. Boys are mostly taken to the Persian Gulf (particularly the United Arab Emirates) to work as camel jockeys or farm workers, while the girls often end up working in brothels in India and Pakistan.<a name="_ftnref48"></a><a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">[48]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There have been reports of trafficking in organs in Bangladesh.<a name="_ftnref49"></a><a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title="">[49]</a> A group of anthropologists from the United States claim to have encountered “kidney theft” in Bangladesh.<a name="_ftnref50"></a><a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title="">[50]</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Traffickers adopt different strategies and tricks to allure and enroll young children and women (and their families) into the trafficking process. The procurement process of women for trafficking in the sex industry in Bangladesh involves their entrapment for selling them to brothels nationally or to neighboring countries, especially to India. In Bangladesh, the traffickers hunt for their clients at the river ports, especially the Sadar Ghat area of Dhaka, bus stations, and the railway stations across the country. At these locations, the traffickers look for migrants who come from the rural areas for jobs or for poor young people abandoned by their families and allure them with false promises of better life. The victims collected from these spots are usually sold to Bangladeshi brothels. Procurement of victims in villages and towns in the border areas of the country is more frequently associated purpose of supplying sex workers for the sex industry in India and the Middle East. The following case studies provide examples of strategies adopted by the traffickers involved in the national and international human trade in Bangladesh.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>3.3.1 Employment Prospects:</i></b> Traffickers look for girls from poorer and vulnerable families in villages and tempt them and their parents with offers of lucrative jobs and a comfortable life in neighboring countries, such as India and Pakistan. At times, the girls are so motivated by promises of the trafficker that they leave home without consulting their parents. A study from Nepal on the factors that influence victims of trafficking in deciding to migrate from their place of origin concluded that the majority of trafficked people were deceived by relatives and village men. Another review on trafficking of the Nepalese women and girls found that the women and girls who were victims of trafficking were deceived by someone they trusted. This study reported that pimps and brokers persuaded them with alluring assurances of happy and married life, a secure and better income job, the life of an actress and other false promises<a name="_ftnref51"></a><a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">[51]</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to economic vulnerability of the family, the traffickers also look for families in which factors, such as domestic abuse and violence, are occurring. Two case studies quoted in Shamim, Kabir and Ali is illustrative of common situations:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b> <i>Case Study 1. Employment prospect</i></b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Monowara Khatun (16), daughter of Islam Sarder, Mazeda (19), daughter of Alam, and Khatun (14), daughter of Ali, were taken from the village Mrigedanga, Sathkhira district. They were allured with promises of well-paid jobs, marriages, and a better life in India by a female trafficker, Jahanara. They never returned to their home village. Villagers believe that they were sold to brothels or to trafficking gangs in India<a name="_ftnref52"></a><a href="#_ftn52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;div class=" popular-posts="" title="" widget="" widget_categories=""><h3 class="widget-title"><span>Disclaimer:</span></h3><div class="widget-content" style="text-align:justify;"><p>The information contains in this web-site is prepared for educational purpose.

As between<br/>contracting States, this Convention supersedes the Conventions of Paris and<br/>Habana previously referred to.<br/>Article 81<br/>Registration of existing agreements<br/>All aeronautical agreements which are in existence on the coming<br/>into force of this Convention, and which are between a contracting State and<br/>any other State or between an airline of a contracting State and any other<br/>State or the airline of any other State, shall be forthwith registered with the<br/>Council.<br/>Article 82<br/>Abrogation of inconsistent arrangements<br/>The contracting States accept this Convention as abrogating all<br/>obligations and understandings between them which are inconsistent with its<br/>terms, and undertake not to enter into any such obligations and<br/>understandings.

If, within thirty days, the arbitrators cannot agree on an umpire,<br/>the President of the Council shall designate an umpire from the list<br/>previously referred to. The arbitrators and the umpire shall then jointly<br/>constitute an arbitral tribunal. Any arbitral tribunal established under this or<br/>the preceding Article shall settle its own procedure and give its decisions by<br/>majority vote, provided that the Council may determine procedural<br/>questions in the event of any delay which in the opinion of the Council is<br/>excessive.<br/>Article 86<br/>Appeals<br/>Unless the Council decides otherwise any decision by the Council<br/>on whether an international airline is operating in conformity with the<br/>provisions of this Convention shall remain in effect unless reversed on<br/>appeal. On any other matter, decisions of the Council shall, if appealed<br/>from, be suspended until the appeal is decided.

The same principle shall apply in the case of any<br/>contracting State which declares a state of national emergency and notifies<br/>the fact to the Council.<br/>CHAPTER XX<br/>ANNEXES<br/>Article 90<br/>Adoption and amendment of Annexes<br/>(a) The adoption by the Council of the Annexes described<br/>in Article 54, subparagraph (l), shall require the vote of two-thirds<br/>of the Council at a meeting called for that purpose and shall then<br/>be submitted by the Council to each contracting State.

The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of inter-national law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. The Court shall not deal with any application submitted under Article 34 that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) is anonymous; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) is substantially the same as a matter that has already been examined by the Court or has already been submitted to another procedure of international investigation or settlement and contains no relevant new infor-mation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. The Court shall declare inadmissible any individual application submitted under Article 34 if it considers that:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) the application is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, manifestly ill-founded, or an abuse of the right of individual application; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage, unless respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto requires an examination of the application on the merits and provided that no case may be rejected on this ground which has not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. The Court shall reject any application which it considers inadmis-sible under this Article. It may do so at any stage of the proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 36</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Third party intervention</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.

In all cases before a Chamber or the Grand Chamber, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights may submit written comments and take part in hearings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 37</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Striking out applications</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1.

Within a period of three months from the date of the judgment of the Chamber, any party to the case may, in exceptional cases, request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. A panel of five judges of the Grand Chamber shall accept the request if the case raises a serious question affecting the interpretation or application of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, or a</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">11 European Convention on Human Rights</p><p style="text-align: justify;">serious issue of general importance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3.

The judgment of the Grand Chamber shall be final.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.

The High Contracting Parties under-take to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. The final judgment of the Court shall be transmitted to the Committee of Ministers, which shall supervise its execution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. If the Committee of Ministers considers that the supervision of the execution of a final judgment is hindered by a problem of interpretation of the judgment, it may refer the matter to the Court for a ruling on the question of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">interpretation.

In addition, the assembly requested that the ICAO Council and the secretary general of the ICAO ensure that the subject of air transport security be given adequate attention and that suitable items addressing questions of securi-ty be included on the agenda of the appropriate meet-ings of the organization. Due to the ICAO’s increas-ing concerns with meeting the growing threat of vi-olence against international civil aviation, stemming in large part from the 1968 hijacking of an El Al flight, the 1969 hijacking of TWA flight 840, and five airliners hijacked in unison by five separate groups in 1970, it convened a diplomatic conference on air law from 8-23 September in Montreal, Canada. The conference adopted the Convention for the Sup-pression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. Also in 1971, the ICAO published a security manual designed to assist states in taking measures to prevent acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation, or to minimize their effects. In December 1972, the Sixth Committee approved a Draft Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of International Terrorism, which established the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism to consid-er the observations of states and submit a report to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1973.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 1981, the ICAO Council adopted Amendment 4 to Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention to introduce the concept of lease, charter, and interchange of aircraft in international operations, and it added a provision on the transportation of persons in custody. <strong>Obligations: </strong>This convention defines the following as offenses: unlawfully and intentionally performing an act of violence against a person on board a civilian aircraft in flight if it is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft; destroying an aircraft in service or caus-ing damage to an aircraft that renders it incapable of flight or is likely to endanger its safety in flight; plac-ing or causing to be placed devices or substances likely to destroy the aircraft, render it incapable of flight, or endanger its safety in flight; destroying or damaging air navigation facilities (only if these facili-ties are used in international air navigation) or inter-fering with their operation; and communicating false information that would endanger the safety of an air-craft in flight. In addition, it is also an offense to at-tempt to commit or to be an accomplice of a person who commits or attempts to commit these offenses. The convention applies, whether the aircraft is en-gaged in an international or domestic flight, only if: the point of take-off or landing, actual or intended, is outside the territory of the state where the aircraft is registered; or if the offense is committed outside of the state of registration. States Parties may establish jurisdiction in cases when the offense takes place in the territory of that state; the state is the state of registration of the air-craft; the aircraft lands in the state’s territory with the alleged offender still on board; or when the offense is committed against or on board an aircraft leased without crew to a lessee whose primary place of business or permanent residence is in that state. Criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with national law is not excluded by this convention. <strong>Compliance and Enforcement: </strong>The convention requires states to make the offenses punishable by severe penalties, and it lays out guidelines for custo-dy of suspects. States Parties are required to either extradite the offender or submit the case for prosecu-tion. States Parties are also required to assist each other in connection with criminal proceedings brought under the convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SAFETY OF CIVIL AVIATION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 4/27/2010 Civair-2</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reservations and Withdrawal: Under Article 14, paragraph 1, disputes between two or more states concerning the interpretation or application of the convention will be submitted to arbitration at the re-quest of one of the states if the matter cannot be set-tled through negotiation. However, a state may make a reservation that it does not consider itself bound by this paragraph at the time of signing, ratification, or accession. In such a case, other States Parties shall not be bound to this paragraph with respect to any State Party who has made such a declaration. Several States Parties, including Afghanistan, Ba-hrain, Belarus, Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Guatemala, Indonesia, Malawi, Mongolia, Oman, Papua New   Guinea, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Ro-mania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria, Tunisia, and Ukraine, made reservations with respect to Article 14 paragraph 1. In addition, Venezuela made reservations regarding Articles 4, 7, and 8 say-ing that it would consider clearly political motives and the circumstances under which offenses are committed, in refusing to extradite or prosecute an offender, unless financial extortion or injury to a per-son on board has occurred. Its reservation is based on the desire to protect its sovereignty in upholding the principle of asylum present in its constitution. Italy, the United States and the United   Kingdom have ob-jected to Venezuela’s reservation. Developments: 2009: The ICAO Legal Committee met in its 34th session from 9-17 September and addressed the initi-ative to amend the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. The committee debated and revised the amendments drafted by its Special Subcommittee. The main con-cerns of States present were that the proposed changes to the convention could hamper trade and development, wrongly criminalize the actions of citi-zens, or require expensive monitoring equipment. The committee was not able to finalize wording for the amendments. 2005-2008: On 24 March 2005, ICAO conducted a survey of its Member States to determine whether existing conventions should be expanded to criminal-ize acts such as the use of civilian aircraft to transfer or disperse biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons. The vast majority of States that responded to the sur-vey believed that such changes were necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In response, the ICAO Legal Committee convened a Special Subcommittee of the Legal Committee (SSCLC) to prepare one or more legal instruments to address these threats. The following States comprised the SSCLC: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Fin-land, France, Germany, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Russian   Federation, Senegal, Singapore, South Afri-ca, Switzerland, United Arab   Emirates, United King-dom, and the United States. The following States served as ex-officio members of the SSCLC: Canada, Italy, India, Nigeria, Jordan, and Egypt. During meetings held from 3-6 July 2007 and 19-21 February 2008, the SSCLC determined that the fol-lowing acts were not criminalized by existing interna-tional law but should be: the use of civilian aircraft as a weapon; the use of civilian aircraft to unlawfully spread biological, chemical, or nuclear substances; acts against civilian aircraft using biological, chemi-cal, and nuclear substances; the use of civilian air-craft to knowingly transport materials intended to be used in biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons; the use of civilian aircraft to transport an individual known to have committed a criminal offense for pur-pose of evading criminal prosecution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During this meeting, the SSCLC decided that the best way to expand international law to cover the offenses involving the use or proliferation of WMD and re-lated materials would be to amend the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. The SSCLC drafted possible amendments for recommendation to the ICAO Legal Committee. Much of the wording was taken directly from the 2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2004: During the 35th session of the ICAO Assembly, held from 28 September to 8 October, several resolu-tions were adopted that relate to the safety of civil aviation: A35-7, “Unified strategy to resolve safety-related deficiencies,” urges states to share and use critical safety information through regional and sub-regional cooperation. A35-9, “Consolidated statement of continuing ICAO policies related to the safeguarding of international civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference,” urges states who have not done so to accede to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. A35-11, “Threat to civil aviation posed by man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS),” calls upon states to cooperate at the international, regional, and sub-regional levels with a view to enhancing and coordinating international efforts aimed at imple-menting countermeasures carefully chosen with re-gard to their effectiveness and cost, and to combating the threat posed by MANPADS.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SAFETY OF CIVIL AVIATION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 4/27/2010 Civair-3</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2001-2002: Following the 11 September 2001 terror-ist attacks on the United States, the ICAO called on its Member States to take various steps to strengthen the convention: first, agree to cooperate fully in the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of all those responsible for these acts of unprecedented savagery; second, meet at a high level to reach agreement among states on how best to prevent and eradicate acts of terrorism against civil aviation; and third, develop a detailed action plan to address the new forms of threat to civil aviation. On 20  February, 2002, Member States of the ICAO endorsed a global strategy for strengthening aviation security worldwide at the two-day, high-level, Minis-terial Conference held at ICAO Headquarters in Montreal. A central element of the strategy is an ICAO “Aviation Security Plan of Action,” which included regular, mandatory, systematic, and harmo-nized audits to enable evaluation of aviation security in place in all 187 Member States of ICAO. Among other elements, the Plan of Action included identifi-cation, analysis, and development of an effective global response to new and emerging threats. 1992: The Libyan case: Libya called for the imple-mentation of Article 14 of the Montreal Convention in regard to charges by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States that nationals and possibly offi-cials of Libya were involved in the 21 December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland and the 19 September 1989 crash of UTA flight 772 over Niger. Libya requested that the Inter-national Court of Justice (ICJ) declare that Libya had complied fully with all of its obligations under the Montreal Convention. Libya claimed that this con-vention is the only appropriate one in force between the parties. Furthermore, in observing the convention, Libya believed it was required to establish its own jurisdiction over alleged offenders present in its terri-tory and submit the case to its authorities for prosecu-tion, as there was no extradition treaty between it and the other parties. Libya claimed that the United States and United   Kingdom were in breach of this conven-tion by rejecting Libyan efforts to resolve the matter within the framework of international law and by placing pressure on it to surrender the two Libyan nationals for trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the request of the Security Council, the UN Secre-tary-General endeavored to persuade the Libyan gov-ernment to comply with resolutions for the purpose of establishing responsibility for the two terrorist acts involving aircraft. The Secretary-General dispatched six UN missions to Libya during this year; however, compliance with the resolutions was not achieved. In 1995, the United   Kingdom and the United States filed preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the ICJ to entertain the applications of Libya. In 1997, the ICJ heard arguments from the United   Kingdom and Unit-ed States on jurisdiction. The two Lockerbie suspects went on trial in May 2000 under Scottish law in the Netherlands. One was convicted of murder in January 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment. The other was acquitted for lack of evidence and freed.

This concern stemmed from reports of crews being kidnapped, ships being hijacked, deli-berately run aground, or blown up by explosives. Due to these developments, especially the 1985 hijacking of the <em>Achille Lauro</em>, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 40/61 in 1985, urging States to cooperate in contributing to the elimination of causes underlying terrorism and invited the IMO to study the problem of terrorism aboard or against ships with a view to making recommendations on appropriate measures. In response to the <em>Achille Lauro </em>hijacking, the Gov-ernments of Austria, Egypt, and Italy made a propos-al in November 1986 that the IMO prepare a conven-tion on the subject of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation.</p><p>To supplement their efforts, the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO issued a circular (MSC/Circ.443) on measures to prevent unlawful acts against passengers and crews on board ships. According to the circular, governments, port authori-ties, administrators, ship-owners, shipmasters, and crews should take appropriate measures to prevent unlawful acts that may threaten passengers and crews. The Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation was adopted in Rome in 1988 <strong>Provisions: </strong>The Convention defines “ship” as any type of vessel whatsoever that is not permanently attached to the sea-bed, including dynamically sup-ported craft, submersibles, or other floating craft. Warships, ships owned or operated by a State when being used as a naval auxiliary or for customs or po-lice purposes, or ships that have been withdrawn from navigation or laid up are not included under the auspices of the Convention. According to the provisions of the Convention, any person commits an offense if that person unlawfully and intentionally commits, attempts to commit, threatens to commit, or abets the seizure or exercise of control over a ship by force or threat of force or any form of intimidation; or commits any of the fol-lowing acts if it endangers or is likely to endanger the safe navigation of that ship: an act of violence against a person on board; destroying a ship or damaging a ship or its cargo; placing or causing to be placed on a ship a device or substance likely to destroy the ship or cause damage to the ship or its cargo; destroying or seriously damaging maritime navigational facili-ties or seriously interfering with their operation; or communicating information he knows to be false. It is also an offense to injure or kill any person in con-nection with the commission or attempted commis-sion of any of the previous offenses. The Convention applies if the ship is navigating or is scheduled to navigate into, through, or from waters beyond the outer limit of the territorial sea of a single State, or the lateral limits of its territorial sea with adjacent States. In all other cases, the Convention also applies when the offender or alleged offender is found in the territory of a State Party other than the State in whose waters the offense occurred.</p><p>SUA CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/15/2010</p><p>States Parties are required to make the offenses pu-nishable by appropriate penalties that take into ac-count the grave nature of those offenses. Measures to establish jurisdiction over the offenses shall be taken when the offense is committed against or on board a ship flying the flag of the State at the time the offense is committed; in the territory of that State, including its territorial sea; by a national of that State; by a stateless person whose habitual residence is in that State; in an attempt to compel that State to do or abstain from doing any act; or when a national of that State is seized, threatened, injured, or killed during the commission of the offense. Compliance and Enforcement: Once jurisdiction has been established, States shall take the offender into custody and immediately make a preliminary inquiry into the facts. States Parties are required to either extradite the offender in custody or submit the case for prosecution. States Parties are also required to assist each other in connection with criminal pro-ceedings brought under the Convention. States Par-ties are also to cooperate in the prevention of offenses by taking all practicable measures to prevent prepara-tions in their respective territories for the commission of those offenses within or outside their territories and by exchanging information in accordance with their national laws. Reservations and Withdrawal: Under Article 16 paragraph 1, disputes between two or more States concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention will be submitted to arbitration at the request of one of the States if the matter cannot be settled through negotiation. However, at the time of signing, ratification, or accession, a State may make a reservation that it does not consider itself bound by this paragraph, in which case other States Parties shall not be bound to it with respect to any States Party that has made such a declaration. Under Article 19, the Convention may be denounced by any State Party at any time after the expiry of one year from the date on which the Convention enters into force for that State. Denunciation shall be made by the deposit of an instrument of denunciation with the Secretary-General and will take effect one year, or such a longer period as may be specified in the instrument of denunciation, after the instrument is received by the Secretary-General.</p><p>Amendments: A conference for the purpose of revis-ing or amending this Convention may be convened by the IMO. The Secretary-General shall convene such a conference of the States Parties to this Con-vention at the request of one-third of the States Par-ties, or 10 States Parties, whichever is the higher fig-ure. Furthermore, any instrument of ratification, ac-ceptance, approval, or accession deposited after the entry into force of an amendment will apply to the Convention as amended. 2005 Protocol to the SUA Convention: The 2005 SUA Protocol adds Article 3(bis), which criminalizes the intentional transport of any material, equipment, or software that is intended to be used to produce a biological, chemical, or nuclear (BCN) weapon. This does not include nuclear material under IAEA safe-guards, which is presumed to be for peaceful purpos-es. The 2005 SUA Protocol also criminalizes the trans-port of a person on board a ship knowing that he committed an offense under the SUA Convention or one of the other UN Counter-Terrorism Conventions. It also requires that States take necessary measures to enable companies, organizations, and similar entities to be held liable when a key manager commits an offense under the Convention. The new Protocol also modifies the SUA Conven-tion’s boarding protocol by establishing additional guidelines for cooperation and procedures to be fol-lowed if a State Party desires to board a ship flying the flag of another State Party due to suspicion that the ship or a person on board the ship is, has been, or is about to be involved in, the commission of an of-fense under the Convention. Once alerted of intention to board a ship, the State Party of the flag the ship is flying has four hours to either deny or approve the boarding. If no response is received within four hours, the requesting State is allowed to board and inspect the vessel. The 2005 SUA Protocol text establishes that the agreement shall enter into force ninety days follow-ing the date on which twelve States have either signed it without reservation as to ratification, accep-tance or approval, or have deposited an instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval, or have depo-sited an instrument of ratification. The 2005 Protocol to the 1988 SUA Protocol applies the same changes as above but in application to fixed platforms as opposed to moving vessels. Developments: 2010: On 9 March, the Dominican   Republic acceded to the 2005 SUA Protocol. At this point, only one additional contracting state or signature without res-ervation is needed for the Protocol to enter into force.</p><p>2009: In 2009, Latvia and Liechtenstein became con-tracting states to the 2005 SUA Protocol. The Inter-national Civil Aviation Organization began the process of drafting an analogous protocol to the Con-</p><p>SUA CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/15/2010</p><p>vention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation. 2007: 18 States signed the 2005 Protocol to the SUA Convention. 2006: The 2005 Protocols opened for signature on February 13, 2006 and will enter into force 90 days after the twelfth country (three countries in the case of the Fixed Platforms Protocol) deposits an instru-ment of ratification or acceptance. The United States signed the protocols on 17 February 2006. 2005: The Diplomatic Conference on the Revision of the SUA Treaties, held in London from 10-14 Oc-tober 2005, adopted new Protocols to the convention following three years of intensive negotiations. They are the 2005 Protocol to the SUA Convention and the 2005 Protocol to the 1988 SUA Protocol (the 1988 Protocol was related to fixed platforms). The new Protocols provide the first international legal frame-work criminalizing the use of a nonmilitary ship as a weapon or as a means to carry out a terrorist attack, and the transport of terrorists or cargo destined for use in a BCN weapon by ship. 2004: During its 88th session, held from 19 to 23 of April, the IMO Legal Committee continued revising the SUA Convention, taking into consideration other conventions and protocols related to terrorism. Most delegations expressed support for the revision and strengthening of the SUA Convention in order to provide a response to the increasing risks posed to maritime navigation by terrorism. Nevertheless, several delegations drew attention to the need to ensure that the prospective SUA Protocols did not jeopardize the principle of freedom of navigation and the right of innocent passage as prescribed in UNCLOS nor the basic principles of international law and the operation of international commercial shipping. The 89th session will be held from 25 to 29 October. The revision of the SUA Convention remains a central issue in the agenda. The objective is to have a draft text ready for consideration by a diplomatic conference in 2005. 2003: During its 86th and 87th sessions, the IMO Legal Committee continued to work on proposed amendments to the SUA Convention and its Protocol. The amendments would significantly broaden the range of offenses included in the convention to adapt it to emerging threats.</p><p>2002: During its 85th session the IMO Legal Com-mittee held a preliminary exchange of views regard-ing the text of draft proposed amendments to the 1988 Convention. Four of these new offenses con-cerned terrorist activities taking place on the ship or directed toward the ship. One of the new offenses concerned the presence of tools or substances not usually used on a ship but useful in a weapon of mass destruction. Two of the new offenses concerned use of the ship for transport of substances to be used for mass destruction. Delegations expressed the need to carefully consider the proposals and to consider whether there was overlap with existing terrorism conventions. It was recognized that even with an ex-panded focus, SUA would remain a maritime con-vention under the competency of IMO, and it was important to ensure that the shipping industry does not become a soft target for terrorist activities. 2001: In November, the IMO Assembly adopted res-olution A.924(22) calling for a review of measures and procedures to prevent acts of terrorism that threaten the security of passengers and crews and the safety of ships. The IMO Legal Committee (which consists of all member states of IMO) is in charge of the revision of the SUA Convention and its Protocol.

arrangements for organising or securing the effective exercise of rights of access;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">g) where the circumstances so require, to provide or facilitate the provision of legal aid and advice, including the participation of legal counsel and advisers;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">h) to provide such administrative arrangements as may be necessary and appropriate to secure the safe return of the child;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">i) to keep each other informed with respect to the operation of this Convention and, as far as possible, to eliminate any obstacles to its application.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER III – RETURN OF CHILDREN</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 8</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any person,

information concerning the identity of the applicant, of the child and of the person alleged to have removed or retained the child;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) where available, the date of birth of the child;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">c) the grounds on which the applicant’s claim for return of the child is based;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">d) all available information relating to the whereabouts of the child and the identity of the person with whom the child is presumed to be.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p

person, concerning the relevant law of that State;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">g) any other relevant document.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 9</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the Central Authority which receives an application referred to in Article 8 has reason to believe that the child is in another Contracting State, it shall directly and without delay transmit the application to the Central Authority of that Contracting State and inform the requesting Central Authority, or the applicant, as the case may be.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 10</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Central Authority of the State where the child is shall take or cause to be taken all appropriate measures in order to obtain the voluntary return of the child.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 11</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings, the applicant or the Central Authority of the requested State, on its own initiative or if asked by the Central Authority of the requesting State, shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay. If a reply is received by the Central Authority of the requested State, that Authority shall transmit the reply to the Central Authority of the requesting State, or to the applicant, as the case may be.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 12</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where the judicial or administrative authority in the requested State has reason to believe that the child has been taken to another State, it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application for the return of the child.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 13</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) the person, institution or other body having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In considering the circumstances referred to in this Article, the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into account the information relating to the social background of the child provided by the Central Authority or other competent authority of the child’s habitual residence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 14</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In ascertaining whether there has been a wrongful removal or retention within the meaning of Article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested State may take notice directly of the law of, and of judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognised or not in the State of the habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign decisions which would otherwise be applicable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 15</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State may, prior to the making of an order for the return of the child, request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the State of the habitual residence of the child a decision or other determination that the removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention, where such a decision or determination may be obtained in that State. The Central Authorities of the Contracting States shall so far as practicable assist applicants to obtain such a decision or determination.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 16</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After receiving notice of a wrongful removal or retention of a child in the sense of Article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the Contracting State to which the child has been removed or in which it has been retained shall not decide on the merits of rights of custody until it has been determined that the child is not to be returned under this Convention or unless an application under this Convention is not lodged within a reasonable time following receipt of the notice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 17</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sole fact that a decision relating to custody has been given in or is entitled to recognition in the requested State shall not be a ground for refusing to return a child under this Convention, but the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested State may take account of the reasons for that decision in applying this Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 18</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The provisions of this Chapter do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 19</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A decision under this Convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 20</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The return of the child under the provisions of Article 12 may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER IV – RIGHTS OF ACCESS</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 21</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An application to make arrangements for organising or securing the effective exercise of rights of access may be presented to the Central Authorities of the Contracting States in the same way as an application for the return of a child.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Central Authorities are bound by the obligations of co-operation which are set forth in Article 7 to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights and the fulfilment of any conditions to which the exercise of those rights may be subject. The Central Authorities shall take steps to remove, as far as possible, all obstacles to the exercise of such rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Central Authorities, either directly or through intermediaries, may initiate or assist in the institution of proceedings with a view to organising or protecting these rights and securing respect for the conditions to which the exercise of these rights may be subject.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER V – GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 22</p><p style="text-align: justify;">No security, bond or deposit, however described, shall be required to guarantee the payment of costs and expenses in the judicial or administrative proceedings falling within the scope of this Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 23</p><p style="text-align: justify;">No legalisation or similar formality may be required in the context of this Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 24</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any application, communication or other document sent to the Central Authority of the requested State shall be in the original language, and shall be accompanied by a translation into the official language or one of the official languages of the requested State or, where that is not feasible, a translation into French or English.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, a Contracting State may, by making a reservation in accordance with Article 42, object to the use of either French or English, but not both, in any application, communication or other document sent to its Central Authority.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 25</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nationals of the Contracting States and persons who are habitually resident within those States shall be entitled in matters concerned with the application of this Convention to legal aid and advice in any other Contracting State on the same conditions as if they themselves were nationals of and habitually resident in that State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 26</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Each Central Authority shall bear its own costs in applying this Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Central Authorities and other public services of Contracting States shall not impose any charges in relation to applications submitted under this Convention. In particular, they may not require any payment from the applicant towards the costs and expenses of the proceedings or, where applicable, those arising from the participation of legal counsel or advisers.

In that case, the Central Authority shall forthwith inform the applicant or the Central Authority through which the application was submitted, as the case may be, of its reasons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 28</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A Central Authority may require that the application be accompanied by a written authorisation empowering it to act on behalf of the applicant, or to designate a representative so to act.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 29</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This Convention shall not preclude any person, institution or body who claims that there has been a breach of custody or access rights within the meaning of Article 3 or 21 from applying directly to the judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State, whether or not under the provisions of this Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 30</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any application submitted to the Central Authorities or directly to the judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State in accordance with the terms of this Convention, together with documents and any other information appended thereto or provided by a Central Authority, shall be admissible in the courts or administrative authorities of the Contracting States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 31</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In relation to a State which in matters of custody of children has two or more systems of law applicable in different territorial units –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) any reference to habitual residence in that State shall be construed as referring to habitual residence in a territorial unit of that State;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) any reference to the law of the State of habitual residence shall be construed as referring to the law of the territorial unit in that State where the child habitually resides.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 32</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In relation to a State which in matters of custody of children has two or more systems of law applicable to different categories of persons, any reference to the law of that State shall be construed as referring to the legal system specified by the law of that State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 33</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of custody of children shall not be bound to apply this Convention where a State with a unified system of law would not be bound to do so.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 34</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This Convention shall take priority in matters within its scope over the Convention of 5 October 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors, as between Parties to both Conventions.

However, the rights and obligations of any third party holder of the assets shall remain subject to the law determined by the choice of law rules of the forum.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 12</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where the trustee desires to register assets, movable or immovable, or documents of title to them, he shall be entitled, in so far as this is not prohibited by or inconsistent with the law of the State where registration is sought, to do so in his capacity as trustee or in such other way that the existence of the trust is disclosed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 13</p><p style="text-align: justify;">No State shall be bound to recognise a trust the significant elements of which, except for the choice of the applicable law, the place of administration and the habitual residence of the trustee, are more closely connected with States which do not have the institution of the trust or the category of trust involved.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 14</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention shall not prevent the application of rules of law more favourable to the recognition of trusts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER IV – GENERAL CLAUSES</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 15</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention does not prevent the application of provisions of the law designated by the conflicts rules of the forum, in so far as those provisions cannot be derogated from by voluntary act, relating in particular to the following matters –</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a) the protection of minors and incapable parties;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">b) the personal and proprietary effects of marriage;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">c) succession rights, testate and intestate, especially the indefeasible shares of spouses and relatives;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">d) the transfer of title to property and security interests in property;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">e) the protection of creditors in matters of insolvency;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">f) the protection, in other respects, of third parties acting in good faith.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If recognition of a trust is prevented by application of the preceding paragraph, the court shall try to give effect to the objects of the trust by other means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 16</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention does not prevent the application of those provisions of the law of the forum which must be applied even to international situations, irrespective of rules of conflict of laws.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If another State has a sufficiently close connection with a case then, in exceptional circumstances, effect may also be given to rules of that State which have the same character as mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any Contracting State may, by way of reservation, declare that it will not apply the second paragraph of this Article.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 17</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the Convention the word “law” means the rules of law in force in a State other than its rules of conflict of laws.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 18</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The provisions of the Convention may be disregarded when their application would be manifestly incompatible with public policy (ordre public).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 19</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing in the Convention shall prejudice the powers of States in fiscal matters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 20</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any Contracting State may, at any time, declare that the provisions of the Convention will be extended to trusts declared by judicial decisions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This declaration shall be notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and will come into effect on the day when this notification is received.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 31 is applicable to the withdrawal of this declaration in the same way as it applies to a denunciation of the Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 21</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any Contracting State may reserve the right to apply the provisions of Chapter III only to trusts the validity of which is governed by the law of a Contracting State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 22</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention applies to trusts regardless of the date on which they were created.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, a Contracting State may reserve the right not to apply the Convention to trusts created before the date on which, in relation to that State, the Convention enters into force.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 23</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the purpose of identifying the law applicable under the Convention, where a State comprises several territorial units each of which has its own rules of law in respect of trusts, any reference to the law of that State is to be construed as referring to the law in force in the territorial unit in question.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 24</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of trusts is not bound to apply the Convention to conflicts solely between the laws of such units.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 25</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention shall not affect any other international instrument containing provisions on matters governed by this Convention to which a Contracting State is, or becomes, a Party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHAPTER V – FINAL CLAUSES</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 26</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at the time of making a declaration in terms of Article 29, make the

into force in accordance with Article 30, paragraph 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The instrument of accession shall be deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the

To prevent future explosions onboard aircraft, the ICAO Council passed a resolution urging its Member States to expedite current research and development on de-tection of explosives and on security equipment dur-ing its regular session meeting in February 1989.</p><p>Also deeply concerned about preventing terrorist bombing of aircraft, the UN Security Council (SC) met on 14 June 1989 to discuss the marking of plastic or sheet explosives for the purpose of detection. On the same day, the SC unanimously adopted Resolu-tion 635 condemning all acts of unlawful interference against the security of civil aviation and calling on Member States to co-operate in devising and imple-menting measures to prevent all acts of terrorism, including those involving explosives. The SC urged the ICAO to intensify its work to prevent all acts of terrorism against international civil aviation, and in particular its work on devising an international re-gime for the marking of plastic or sheet explosives for the purpose of detection. Also in June, the ICAO Council decided to include preparation of a new legal instrument regarding the marking of explosives for detectability as a priority in the general work program of the Legal Committee.</p><p>From 9-19 January 1990, the ICAO Sub-Committee for the Preparation of a New Legal Instrument Re-garding the Marking of Plastic Explosives for Detec-tability met in Montreal, Canada and drafted a new international agreement to ensure that plastic explo-sives were marked with an additive to enhance their detectability. The ICAO Legal Committee considered this draft during its 27th session, which met from 27 March-12 April. This meeting resulted in a final text of six ar-ticles for a draft convention. From 12 February-1  March 1991, the International Conference on Air Law met in Montreal to consider the draft articles prepared by the ICAO Legal Com-mittee in 1990. The Conference adopted the Conven-tion by consensus and without a vote. By the end of the year, 45 States had signed the Convention and one State had submitted an instrument of approval. <strong>Obligations: </strong>This Convention calls on States Parties to take the necessary and effective measures to pro-hibit and prevent the manufacture of unmarked ex-plosives in their territories, to prevent the movement of such explosives into or out of their territory, to exercise strict control over the possession and trans-fer of unmarked explosives made or imported prior to the entry into force of the Convention, to ensure that all stocks not held by the military or police are de-stroyed or consumed, marked, or rendered perma-nently ineffective within three years of the Conven-tion’s entry into force, with respect to a State, and to ensure the timely destruction of any unmarked explo-sives manufactured after the entry into force of the Convention for that State. States Parties agree to mark plastic explosives with a chemical agent that can be detected by commercially available vapor or particle trace detectors and/or ca-nines. There are four such chemical agents identified in the Convention.</p><p><strong>Compliance and Enforcement: </strong>The Convention establishes an International Explosives Technical Commission composed of members appointed by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organiza-tion (based on nominations of States Parties to the Convention). The parameters for membership allow between 15 and 19 experts with direct experience in matters relating to the manufacture, detection of, or research in explosives. Members will serve three-year renewable terms. Sessions of the Commission shall</p><p>CONVENTION ON PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 4/23/2010 Plastic-2</p><p>be convened at least once a year at the ICAO Head-quarters or as directed or approved by the ICAO Council. The Commission is tasked with evaluating technical developments relating to the manufacture, marking, and detection of explosives, reporting findings to the States Parties and international organizations in-volved, and making recommendations for amend-ments to the Technical Annex to the Convention. Under Article 13, States are requested to declare whether they are producer States when depositing their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approv-al, or accession. Amendments: The Council, on the recommendation of the Commission, may propose to States Parties amendments to the Technical Annex to the Conven-tion. Within 90 days of the notification of a proposed amendment to the Technical Annex, States Parties may convey comments to the Council. The Commis-sion will consider these views and make a report to the Council. Any proposed amendment that has not been objected to by five or more States Parties will be adopted. The Commission will give further con-sideration to any amendments objected to by five or more States Parties. Reservations and Withdrawals: Under Article 11 paragraph 1, disputes between two or more States concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention will be submitted to arbitration at the request of one of the States if the matter cannot be settled through negotiation. However, at the time of signing, ratification, or accession, a State may make a reservation that it does not consider itself bound by this paragraph, in which case other States Parties shall not be bound to it with respect to any State Par-ty that has made such a declaration. In addition, States Parties may denounce this Con-vention by written notification to the Depository. In such a case, denunciation will take effect 180 days following the date on which notification is received. Several States including Algeria, Brazil, Honduras, India, Peru, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, have made reservations with respect to Article 11. States that have declared their status as producer States under Article 13 include Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, India, Japan, Norway, Slovakia, Spain, Swit-zerland, United   Kingdom, and the United States. Developments: 2007: The 36th session of the ICAO Assembly was as held 18-28 September. 2004: During the 35th session of the ICAO Assembly, held from 28 September to 8 October, the Council presented proposals for carrying forward the Plan of Action into the 2005-2007 triennium and for updating the Consolidated statement of continuing ICAO poli-cies related to the safeguarding of international civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference. 2002: The ICAO approved the International Explo-sives Technical Commission’s (IETC) recommenda-tion to amend the Technical Annex to the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection by deleting ortho-Mononitrotoluene (o-MNT) from the list of detection agents. In accordance with Article 7, paragraph 3 of the Convention, the amendment was adopted on 27 September 2001 and entered into force on 27 March 2002. As recommended by the high-level Ministerial Con-ference, which met 20  February 2002, the ICAO Le-gal Committee was requested to review the adequacy of the existing aviation security legal instruments and, if necessary, to develop an appropriate legal instrument addressing this issue. 2001: The ICAO Assembly met from 25 September-5 October in Montreal, Canada. Recognizing the crit-ical need to enhance aviation security, following the tragic developments of 11 September 2001, States were urged to immediately review their aviation se-curity measures and take additional appropriate steps to strengthen aviation security consistent with ICAO Annex 17. States were urged to ratify various Con-ventions related to civil aviation security, especially the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, which was signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991, as a matter of urgency. Specifically, resolution A33-2 requested the Council (the governing body of ICAO) to complete, in addi-tion to the International Explosives Technical Com-mission (IETC) mandate as prescribed by the Con-vention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, studies into methods of detect-ing explosives or explosive materials, especially into the marking of those explosives of concern, other than plastic explosives, with a view to the evolution, if needed, of an appropriate comprehensive legal re-gime.</p><p>2000: The Aviation Security Panel of the ICAO con-ducted a comprehensive review of Annex 17 to adjust its structure and relevancy of Standards and Recom-mended Practices (SARPS). Draft Amendment 10</p><p>CONVENTION ON PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 4/23/2010 Plastic-3</p><p>was developed based on the Panel’s recommenda-tions and was to be considered in April 2001. The amendment included provisions relating to code-sharing, the Standard Airline Security Program Tem-plate, preventive measures relating to cargo, pre-employment background checks, development of human factors, management of response to acts of unlawful interference, armed persons on board an aircraft, and penetration of security systems by the news media. To assess the implementation of Annex 17, States will be audited on a voluntary basis. 1998: The Council of the ICAO considered proposals for the formation, composition, and mandate of the International Explosives Technical Commission es-tablished under Article 5 of the Convention. 1997: The 11th meeting of the Ad Hoc Group of Spe-cialists on the Detection of Explosives was held at ICAO Headquarters from 3-7 November. The spe-cialists reported on their work and findings since the last meeting. The group was mandated to maintain the technical annex to the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection until such time as the Convention enters into force. At such time, the ICAO Council considered the for-mation of the International Explosives Technical Commission. The ninth meeting of the Aviation Security Panel was held at ICAO Headquarters in Montreal from 8-12 September. The agenda included issues related to screening of checked baggage, the security regime of cargo, collaborative arrangements between operators, and the “one-stop” security concept.</p><p>1996: Immediately after the crash of TWA 800, a group of Ministers from the G-7 countries, with the Russian   Federation, met in Lyon to address the issue of international terrorism. As a result of that meeting, the ICAO was asked to expedite its activities on ex-plosive detection, as well as to intensify its work on screening of checked baggage. The Council subse-quently convened an informal meeting of the Ad Hoc Group. The result of the Group’s efforts was the pub-lication of criteria for explosives detection, which was circulated to States. The Council also adopted an amendment to Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, which contained recommendations to conduct back-ground checks for security personnel, a standard to conduct a security survey to identify needs, a recom-mendation to ensure that catering supplies are subject to scrutiny, and a recommendation that operators carry only baggage authorized for carriage.</p><p>1992: At the 29th session of the ICAO Assembly, it adopted a resolution dealing with the implementation of the 1991 Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives.

21	<h2 class="blog_entry-title">CONVENTION ON THE PROHIBITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND STOCKPILING OF BACTERIOLOGICAL (BIOLOGICAL) AND TOXIN WEAPONS AND ON THEIR DESTRUCTION (BTWC)</h2>
<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/legal-documentations-litigations/international-conventions-treaties/political-diplomatic-defence/convention-on-the-prohibition-of-the-development-production-and-stockpiling-of-bacteriological-biological-and-toxin-weapons-and-on-their-destruction-btwc/attachment/convention-on-the-prohibition-of-the-development/" rel="attachment wp-att-6107">Convention on the prohibition of the development</a> <strong>Opened for Signature: </strong>10 April 1972. <strong>Entered into Force: </strong>26 March 1975. <strong>Duration: </strong>Unlimited. <strong>Membership </strong> Egypt and Syria are among the signatories, but have not yet ratified the convention. Israel is among the countries that did not sign the treaty. <strong>Depositaries: </strong>Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. <strong>Treaty Text </strong> <strong>Treaty Obligations: </strong>States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological and Toxin Wea-pons and on their Destruction (BTWC) are obligated not to develop, produce, stockpile, or otherwise ac-quire or obtain microbial or other biological agents or toxins of types and in quantities that have no justifi-cation for prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes; not to develop, produce, stockpile, or oth-erwise acquire or obtain weapons, equipment, or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict; to destroy, or to divert to peaceful purposes (not later than nine months after the entry into force of the convention) all agents, toxins, weapons, equipment, and means of delivery; not to transfer to any reci-pient, and not in any way to assist, encourage, or in-duce to manufacture or otherwise acquire any of the agents, toxins, weapons, equipment, or means of de-livery; to take necessary measures to prohibit the above within their own territories. Although the BTWC (in its title and in Article I) does not explicitly prohibit “use” of biological weapons, the Final Dec-laration of the 1996 Treaty Review Conference reaf-firmed that, although “use” is not explicitly prohi-bited under Article I of the BWC, it is still considered to be a violation of the convention. <strong>Verification and Compliance</strong>: <strong><em>Verification</em></strong><strong>: </strong>There is no formal verification regime to monitor compliance. Member States are encour-aged to abide by numerous confidence-building measures (CBMs) prescribed by State Parties at vari-ous review conferences. These include: domestic implementation measures, if considered necessary; consultation and co-operation among parties; lodging of complaints with the UN Security Council; and incentives, such as assistance to victims. Since 1991, there have been efforts to negotiate a verification protocol to strengthen the BTWC’s lack of provisions for an international mechanism to monitor com-pliance. Difficulties in creating a verification regime for the BTWC include: any nation with a developed pharmaceutical industry has the potential to make biological weapons; the emergence of non-state ac-tors makes it difficult to develop effective verifica-tion measures. <strong><em>Compliance: </em></strong>One example of allegations of non-compliance with the BTWC is the 1981 accusation by the United States that the Soviet Union supplied mycotoxins—poisonous compounds synthesized by fungi—to its Communist allies in Southeast Asia for military use against resistance forces in Laos and Cambodia. The UN Secretary-General dispatched two expert groups to the region to investigate the allegations. Both were inconclusive, demonstrating the need to launch an investigation shortly after an alleged attack, when the forensic evidence is still fresh, and to gain full access to the effected sites and attack victims. <strong>Amendments and Withdrawal: </strong>Under Article XI, States Parties may propose amendments to this con-vention. Amendments shall enter into force for each State Party accepting the amendments when the amendment is accepted by a majority of the States Parties to the convention. For each remaining State Party thereafter, the amendment will take effect on the date of acceptance. The convention gives the par-ties a right of withdrawal, provided that notice is giv-en to all other States Parties to the convention and to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) three months in advance. Such notice shall include a state-ment of the extraordinary events the State regards as having jeopardized its supreme interests (Article XIII). BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-2 Review Conference: The Review Conference of the BTWC takes place every five years. Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs): In the Final Declaration adopted at the Third Review Con-ference of the Parties to the BWC held in 1996, the States Parties agreed to implement a new format of confidence-building measures to improve interna-tional cooperation in the field of peaceful bacterio-logical (biological) activities (BWC/CONF.III/23, Part II, Annex). These included: (1) a declaration form on “Nothing to declare” or “Nothing new to declare”; (2) exchange of data on research centers and laboratories that meet very high national or inter-national safety standards; (3) exchange of informa-tion on national biological defense research and de-velopment programs, including declarations on facili-ties where biological defense research and develop-ment programs are conducted. (This measure also includes information relating to contractors and on available publications.); (4) exchange of information on outbreaks of infectious diseases and similar occur-rences caused by toxins that seem to deviate from the normal pattern; (5) encouragement of publication of results of biological research directly related to the convention and promotion of use for permitted pur-poses of knowledge gained in this research; (6) active promotion of contacts between scientists, other ex-perts at facilities engaged in biological research di-rectly related to the convention, including exchanges and visits for joint research on mutually agreed basis; (7) declaration of legislation, regulations, and other measures, including exports and/or imports of patho-genic microorganisms in accordance with the con-vention; (8) declaration of past activities in offensive and/or defensive biological research and development programs since 1 January 1946; and (9) declaration on vaccine production facilities, licensed by the State Party for the protection of humans. A summary table has been prepared to indicate participation of the States Parties in each of the agreed CBMs since 1997. Sixty-one states (38% of States Parties) submitted CBM information requested during the Sixth Review Conference. Several States Parties approached the Implementation Support Unit (ISU) to enquire if, in the interests of transparency, their CBMs could also be made available in the publicly-accessible area of the ISU website. For 2008, nine CBM country reports have been placed in the publicly-accessible area of the CBM section of the website (they also remain available in the restricted area). Developments: 2009: The 2009 BTWC Meetings will be chaired by Ambassador Marius Grinius of Canada. The Meeting of Experts will be held from 24-28 August and the Meeting of States Parties will be held on 7-11 De-cember. 2008: The following states acceded to the BTWC in 2008: Zambia (15 January), Madagascar (7 March), United Arab Emirates (20 June), and Cook Islands (5 December). The 2008 Meeting of Experts was held in Geneva from 18-22 August 2008. The meeting was chaired by Ambassador Georgi Avramchev of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The meeting dis-cussed and promoted national, regional, and interna-tional measures to improve biosafety and biosecurity, including laboratory safety and security of pathogens and toxins, and oversight, education, awareness rais-ing, and adoption and/or development of codes of conduct with the aim of preventing misuse in the context of advances in bio-science and bio-technology research with the potential of use for pur-poses prohibited by the Convention. The meeting included three panel discussions on the topics of risk management, industry, and education and awareness-raising. Experts were invited to share their opinions and to offer suggestions on the ques-tions raised by the Chair and the delegates. Some of the main themes were: developing an integrated net-work of information that could be shared between developed and developing countries, informing and engaging the public when outbreaks occur, training scientists to respond to outbreaks and crises, and creating stronger alliances between industry and gov-ernment. The meeting featured the ISU’s first ever poster ses-sions on 19 and 21 August. These sessions gave ex-perts an opportunity to meet their counterparts among the various delegations and present details of their work. All States Parties, International Organizations, Nongovernmental Organizations, and private sector delegations were invited to participate, and nearly 30 posters were presented in total. The sessions were enthusiastically received and will likely continue in the future. The Meeting of States Parties was held in Geneva on 1-5 December, 2008, and was chaired by Ambassa-dor Georgi Avramchev of the Former Yugoslav Re-public of Macedonia. The meeting consolidated the work of the Meeting of Experts in a final report. Many States Parties stressed the need for universali-zation and the necessity for countries to continually BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-3 submit their CBMs. Although CBMs are not legally binding, some States Parties, such as Switzerland, noted that they are politically binding and part of the obligations of the treaty. Some States Parties also suggested expanding the ISU duties to include an international scientific advisory panel as part of the seventh review conference. 94 States Parties attended the meeting and 39 States Parties made statements. 2007: On 28 June, Kazakhstan acceded to the BTWC. The 2007 Meeting of Experts was held in Geneva from 20-24 August 2007. The meeting was chaired by Ambassador Masood Khan of Pakistan. In accor-dance with the decision of the Sixth Review Confe-rence, the meeting dealt with ways and means to en-hance national implementation, including enforce-ment of national legislation, strengthening of national institutions and coordination among national law enforcement institutions, and regional and sub-regional cooperation on implementation of the BWC. The meeting concluded on 24 August by adopting its report by consensus and the presentation of an Inte-rim Universalization Report by the chairman. On 20 August, the Implementation Support Unit (ISU) was officially launched. The ISU was created to assist states parties in the implementation of the BWC by providing administrative support to States Parties, facilitate communication, promote confi-dence-building measures, and to work towards the universalization of the convention. The 2007 Meeting of States Parties was held in Ge-neva from 10-14 December 2007. Ninety-five states parties and six signatories participated in the meeting, which was chaired by Ambassador Masood Khan of Pakistan. In accordance with the decision of the Sixth Review Conference, the Meeting of States Parties considered the work of the previously held Meeting of Experts. The meeting concluded with a consensus report mainly addressing procedural issues. 2006: The Preparatory Committee for the Sixth Re-view Conference was held in Geneva from 26-28 April and made the procedural arrangements neces-sary for the Review Conference. The Sixth Review Conference was held from 20 No-vember to 8 December in Geneva. In his opening remarks, Secretary General Kofi Anan called on the states parties to not repeat the deadlock of the 2001 Review Conference and stressed the importance of the convention and moving forward. Masood Khan of Pakistan was elected president of the conference and stressed the need to allow for no complacency in ad-dressing the threats posed by biological weapons. The most important decision of the Review Confe-rence was to establish an Implementation Support Unit consisting of three full-time staff members to provide support and confidence building measures. The conference endorsed the consensus documents from 2003-2005 meetings of the States Parties, de-cided for 2007-2010 to hold four annual meetings of the states parties of one week duration each year to discuss and promote common understanding and ef-fective action. The conference also made a decision concerning confidence-building measures, namely that the Implementation Support Unit should develop an electronic format of the existing confidence-building measures forms, and centralize requests and offers of assistance regarding the submission of these by states parties. On the promotion of universaliza-tion, the conference agreed that a concerted effort by states parties was needed to persuade states not party to the convention to join. 2005: The Third Meeting of Experts from States Par-ties to the convention met in Geneva from 13-24 June. 82 States Parties participated in the Meeting of Experts. Egypt, Madagascar, and the Syrian Arab Republic also participated as signatories, who hold no decision-making power in the meeting. Israel par-ticipated as an observer. The meeting was chaired by Ambassador John Freeman of the United Kingdom. Experts from various international organizations, such as the International Organization of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Health Organization (WHO), were granted observer status. Twenty-three scientific, professional, academ-ic, and industry bodies participated informally as guests of the Meeting of Experts. Sixteen non-governmental organizations and research institutes also attended the meeting. The Meeting of Experts held two public meetings on 13 and 24 June, respectively, five open sessions, and three working sessions. At these gatherings, experts discussed the options for development and imple-mentation of codes of conduct for scientists to help prevent contravention of the BWC. Participants also discussed the merits of a universal code system ver-sus multiple codes, and the relationship of voluntary or contract-based codes of conduct to enforceable legislation and regulations. The experts reached general agreement that the codes of conduct should uphold central tenets of the BWC while also working to balance the need for scientific BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-4 freedom against the need to prevent deliberate and inadvertent scientific misuses. Alternatively, on the issue of increased education, participants varied in their opinion of who should be responsible for prom-ulgating codes of conduct and whether the approach should be a “top-down” or “bottom-up” strategy. At the end of the meeting, the chair prepared an in-formal paper listing the considerations, recommenda-tions, and conclusions drawn from the gatherings. While the paper has no official status, it was the chair’s view that the paper could assist delegations in their preparation for the upcoming Meeting of States Parties. 2004: A two-week Meeting of Experts of the States Parties to the Convention convened in Geneva from 19-31 July, in accordance with a three-year program established at the Fifth Review Conference. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Peter Goosen of South Africa, and attended by representatives of 87 States Parties, four signatories, and two observer States to the convention. In addition, experts from various international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World Organization for Animal Health, which are aiding in the creation of contingency plans for responding to disease outbreaks, also attended and participated in the conference as observers. The Meeting of Experts held public sessions on 19 and 30 July, and 17 additional working meetings. During the first week of the session, participants fo-cused on addressing means of “strengthening and broadening national and international institutional efforts and existing mechanisms for the surveillance, detection, diagnosis and combating of infectious dis-eases affecting humans, animals, and plants.” During this time, participants heard nearly 100 statements, presentations, and interventions and considered a number of working papers on the subject submitted by States Parties. The following week, the primary agenda item was to discuss the enhancement of “international capabilities for responding to, investigating and mitigating the effects of cases of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease.” States Parties, signatories, and observers heard and dis-cussed a number of presentations, statements, and working papers related to this topic. In addition, par-ticipants utilized several background papers prepared by the Secretariat regarding mechanisms being im-plemented by intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations in terms of disease surveillance and disease outbreaks, and on mechan-isms available to States Parties to investigate the al-leged use of biological or toxin weapons and provide assistance within the context of the convention. At the conclusion of the conference, the chair com-piled a paper, including conclusions, recommenda-tions, proposals, and ideas drawn from the Experts Meeting. The paper was not given any official status and does not represent the views of all States Parties or signify indicate that a consensus was reached. Ra-ther, it is intended to assist delegates in their prepara-tion for the Annual Meeting of States Parties, which took place from 6-10 December in Geneva. The 2004 Meeting of States Parties convened in Ge-neva from 6-10 December, with Mr. Peter Goosen of South Africa as the chair. 87 States Parties to the convention participated in the Meeting of States. Four signatory states, Egypt, Madagascar, Myanmar, and the United Republic of Tanzania, participated in the meeting without taking part in decision-making. Two additional states, Israel and Kazakhstan, joined the meeting as observers. Among other observers were The Food and Agricul-ture Organizations (FAO), the International Commit-tee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the World Health Or-ganization (WHO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Fourteen NGOs and research institutes also attended. The Meeting of States Parties held two public meet-ings on 6 and 10 December, respectively, as well as multiple working sessions and, on 6 December, a general debate in which 28 States Parties made statements. During the meeting, States Parties considered broa-dening and strengthening national and international institutional efforts and existing mechanisms for the surveillance, detection, diagnosis, and combating of infectious diseases affecting humans, animals, and plants. Members agreed on the importance of sup-porting existing networks of relevant organizations, such as the WHO, FAO, and OIE, as well as develop-ing national and regional disease surveillance capa-bilities. Members also discussed enhancing international ca-pabilities for responding to, investigating, and miti-gating the effects of cases of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons or suspicious outbreaks of disease. The States Parties recognized the need to continue to develop their own national capabilities for response, as well as cooperative efforts and provisions for in-ternational assistance. At its closing on December 10, the Meeting of States Parties of the convention approved the nomination of BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-5 Ambassador John Freeman of the United Kingdom as the chair of the Meeting of Experts and the Meeting of States Parties in 2005. 2003: From 18-29 August, the first meeting of ex-perts from States Parties to the BTWC was held in Geneva under the chairmanship of Ambassador Tibor Toth. The meeting was the first stage of a new process established by the Fifth Review Conference of the BTWC; its purpose was to prepare the ground for the annual meeting of States Parties, scheduled for 10-14 November 2003. The meeting addressed two topics: the adoption of necessary national measures to implement the prohi-bitions set forth in the convention, including the enactment of penal legislation: and national mechan-ism to establish and maintain the security and over-sight of pathogenic microorganisms and toxins. The first topic of national legislation was divided into the following sub-topics to promote discussion: (1) legal, regulatory, and administrative (e.g., civil legislation, penal legislation, regulations, guidelines); (2) prohi-bitions (e.g., direct implementation, war materials, development, production, possession and use, com-plementary legislation); (3) restrictions (e.g., classifi-cation, operational framework, intangible technolo-gies, sanctions); (4) practical implementation and enforcement (e.g., national infrastructure, interna-tional cooperation, education and training, experts); (5) criminalization and law enforcement (e.g., infor-mation sharing, enforcement, international arrange-ments). The second topic of bio-security was divided into the following sub-topics for discussion: (1) legal, regula-tory and administrative (e.g., national and interna-tional models and standards, risk assessment, pro-gram design and consequence management); (2) fa-cilities (e.g., facility planning and management, sto-rage, containment, custody and disposal of dangerous pathogens); (3) personnel (e.g., personnel issues for pathogen management, training and continuing edu-cation in pathogen security); (4) transport and trans-fer (e.g., transport and transfer of dangerous patho-gens, type of recipient facility); (5) oversight and enforcement (e.g., issues of licensing, accreditation and authorization). The experts discussed technical aspects covering a range of experiences and ideas related to national implementation of the BTWC. In addition to national delegations, experts from a range of international organizations, including the World Health Organiza-tion (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) shared their knowledge. It re-mains unclear how the States Parties will make use of the information presented at the meeting. From 10-14 November, the meeting of the States Parties was held in Geneva. At the meeting, con-vened under Chairman Tibor Toth of Hungary, repre-sentatives of 92 States Parties, four signatories, two observer States, and several intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations developed the work begun at the August expert meeting. Two public meetings and seven working sessions were held, the first of which consisted of a general debate. During the remainder of the working sessions, discussion focused on consideration of necessary national meas-ures to implement the prohibitions set forth in the convention, including the enactment of penal legisla-tion and national mechanisms to establish and main-tain the security and oversight of pathogenic micro-organisms and toxins. Specifically, the second work-ing session addressed prohibitions of the convention, the third addressed licensing issues, the fourth consi-dered enforcement issues, the fifth was dedicated to evaluations and implementation of bio-security pro-cedures, and the sixth focused on licensing and rele-vant efforts by international organizations. In the process of discussion, delegates utilized a number of working papers as well as a CD-ROM-based information repository prepared by the Secreta-riat that included States Parties’ implementation of national measures related to the convention. In con-cluding the meeting, States Parties approved the nomination of Mr. Peter Goosen of South Africa as chairman of the 2004 Meeting of Experts and Meet-ing of States Parties. In 2004 the focus of the new process will shift to enhancing international capabilities for responding to, investigating and mitigating the effects of cases of alleged use of biological weapons or suspicious out-breaks of disease, and to strengthening national and international efforts against infectious diseases. The 2005 meetings will address codes of conduct for scientists. 2002: On 11 November, the resumed session of the Fifth Review Conference of the States Parties to the BTWC started in Geneva. After opening the Confe-rence, the chairman, Ambassador Tibor Toth, sus-pended the formal session and called for informal consultations on a draft proposal ? in the form of a draft decision ? developed by him after consultations with many governments. Ambassador Toth’s propos-al attempted to find a middle ground between the hard-line position of the United States and substan-tive proposals made by States Parties such as the BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-6 United Kingdom and South Africa since the Decem-ber 2001 session of the Conference. The decision mandated a one-week meeting of States Parties in each of the three years (2003-2005) leading up to the next Review Conference. The purpose of these meet-ings would be to promote common understanding and effective action on issues of concern to all States Par-ties. Each annual meeting would be preceded by a two-week expert level meeting. The first meeting in 2003 would be devoted to the adoption of national measures to implement the pro-hibitions set forth in the convention, including the enactment of criminal legislation as well as national mechanisms to establish and maintain the security and oversight of pathogenic micro organisms and toxins. In 2004, the discussions would consider en-hancing international capabilities for responding to, investigating, and mitigating the effects of cases of alleged use of biological or toxin weapons or suspi-cious outbreaks of disease. The meeting will also consider strengthening and broadening national and institutional efforts and existing mechanisms for the surveillance, detection, diagnosis, and combating of infectious diseases affecting humans, animals, and plants. The final meeting to be held in 2005 would consider the role and responsibility of the scientific community and look at the content, promulgation, and adoption of codes of conduct for scientists. Ambassador Toth’s proposal was incorporated in the Final Report of the Conference. In his concluding remarks, Ambassador Toth stated that it was the re-sponsibility of each and every State Party to make the upcoming meetings work and to identify ways to strengthen the convention. 2001: On 12 February, the BTWC Verification Pro-tocol Ad Hoc Group (AHG) began its 22nd session with the task of completing the negotiations before the Fifth BTWC Review Conference scheduled to take place in November-December 2001. Some dele-gations said that the AHG’s method of negotiation had been exhausted and called on the chair to pro-duce a “vision text” ? the chair’s proposal of what the end product should look like. Other delegations believed that the introduction of the vision text would endanger the friendly and cooperative atmosphere and kill the negotiations and the Protocol. They said that any departures from textual negotiations (based on the rolling text) would need to remain informal. On 30 March, the AHG chair released a “composite text” ? the chair’s proposal for a verification in-strument to the BTWC. The document received a mixed reaction. The Western countries plus some “conservative” representatives of NAM (Brazil, Chile, South Africa) supported this effort. Other del-egations, namely Pakistan, Iran, and China, were re-sistant to it, calling the “composite text” a good ref-erence or background document, but insisting that the rolling text remained the basis of the negotiations. On 25 July, at the beginning of the 24th session of the AHG, the United States formally announced its rejec-tion of the Verification Protocol – not only in its cur-rent draft version, but also of further efforts to nego-tiate such an agreement. The United States concluded that “the current approach to a Protocol” was not “capable of strengthening confidence in compliance with the convention; it would not improve the ability to verify compliance” and would “do little” to deter countries seeking biological weapons. The United States announced that it would not support the chair’s composite text, even with changes, as an appropriate outcome of the Ad Hoc Group’s efforts. Instead of a Protocol, the United States said it would develop other ideas and different approaches that could help to achieve the objective of effectively strengthening the BTWC. The United States argued that the draft protocol could not achieve the objective of covering illicit activities, as there was no great promise of pro-viding useful, accurate, and complete information to the international community, as well as deterring or hindering a rogue State’s ability to conduct illicit activities. Furthermore, the United States argued, regular on-site activities ? transparency visits ? risked damaging innocent declared facilities, and putting national security and commercial propriety information at risk. The United States stated that it could not agree to subject itself to such risks when there was no corresponding benefit in impeding proli-feration efforts around the globe. With respect to ex-port controls, the United States said that the conven-tion was a disarmament instrument, not a trade in-strument. The United States also voiced its displea-sure with calls to abolish existing export control ar-rangements such as the Australia Group and referred to attempts to fix the meaning of the convention’s terms ? a reference to Russia’s interest in definitions ? as well as to investigations of disease outbreaks that the United States felt were too restrictive. The US announcement was met with deep disap-pointment on the part of all other States Parties. Most of the delegations reacted quite moderately because such an announcement had been largely anticipated. Although some delegations urged the AHG to con-tinue negotiations regardless of the US announce-ment, many were not willing to proceed with finaliz-ing the text without US participation and quickly turned their attention to the question of how best to salvage the Protocol and the process. In the end, the BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-7 States Parties decided not to finalize an agreement without the United States, but instead, they agreed to start drafting the AHG’s report, while preserving what had been achieved thus far. By the end of the 24th session, the AHG failed to agree on the final report on its negotiations on a protocol for the con-vention. On one hand, there was a realization that the report would not be binding with regard to the AHG’s future. On the other hand, the report would put on record some important agreements, most nota-bly, that the AHG considered that its mandate was still in force and had yet to be fulfilled. In addition, the report would emphasize the principle of multila-teral negotiations and recognize the two texts ? the rolling text and the chair’s composite text ? as the products of the six-and-a-half years of negotiations. The Fifth Review Conference of the BTWC was scheduled for 19 November-7 December 2001. Pre-ceding the Conference, on 1 November, US President George W. Bush stated that despite the BTWC, the scourge of biological weapons had not been eradi-cated. Instead, the threat was growing, mainly posed by rogue States and terrorists who possess these wea-pons and are willing to use them. The president stated that the United States is committed to strengthening the convention as part of a comprehensive strategy for combating the complex threats of WMD and ter-rorism and proposed the following measures “to fa-shion an effective international approach to streng-then the BTWC”: enact strict national criminal legis-lation against prohibited biological weapons (BW) activities with strong extradition requirements; estab-lish an effective UN procedure for investigating sus-picious outbreaks or allegations of BW use; establish procedures for addressing BTWC compliance con-cerns; commit to improving international disease control and to enhance mechanisms for sending ex-pert response teams to cope with outbreaks; establish sound national oversight mechanisms for the security and genetic engineering of pathogenic organisms; devise a solid framework for bio-scientists in the form of a code of ethical conduct that would have universal recognition; and promote responsible con-duct in the study, use, modification, and shipment of pathogenic organisms. On 19 November, in the statement at the Fifth BTWC Review Conference, the United States reiterated that it rejected the draft verification protocol to the con-vention on the grounds that the defiant States and non-State actors would never be hampered by this Protocol and that the arms control approaches of the past would not solve the current problems. The Unit-ed States argued that such States and non-State actors would not have declared their current covert offen-sive programs or the locations of their illegal work ? nor would the draft Protocol have required them to do so. The United States also stated that by giving proli-ferators the BTWC stamp of approval, the Protocol would have provided them with a “safe harbor” while lulling other signatories into a false sense of security. The United States claimed that many governments had privately told the US delegation that they shared their reservations. The United States further ex-pressed concern with the activities of Bin Laden’s al-Qaeda, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Iran, Sudan, and Syria to acquire biological weapons. The United States called on the States Parties to “look beyond traditional arms control measures to deal with the complex and dangerous threats posed by biological weapons” and reiterated proposals for strengthening the convention announced by President Bush on 1 November. In the course of the proceedings, Iran, Iraq, and Libya rejected US accusations. Iraq claimed that its BW program had been destroyed as part of the disarma-ment mandate of the UN Special Commission (UN-SCOM), and feared it was about to be attacked by the United States on the pretext of proliferation concerns. Iran rejected the accusations “categorically,” adding that such accusations would lead to confrontation rather than cooperation in the Conference and ex-pressed suspicion that this might be the intention, since the United States was now clearly opposed to multilateralism. Libya said the allegations were “nothing new” and asked the United States not to use the Conference as “a launching pad for accusations” since this would only damage the prospect of reach-ing consensus at the Conference. The delegates gen-erally believed that the US accusatory statement would only serve to make the work of the Conference more difficult, while its proposals, unless comple-mented by more comprehensive, multilateral and legally binding arrangements, would not be received favorably by many States Parties. China called the US position “neither fair nor reasonable.” Cuba feared that the United States had forced the Member States to lose 10 years of progress, arguing that Washington’s new stance was completely inconsis-tent with the US delegation’s previous demands to ease several of its clauses, only to reject it after in-voking, among other reasons, its weaknesses. On 21 November, the Member States heard the views of non-governmental organizations (NGO) on the strengthening of the convention. The NGO, including the Network of Engineers and Scientists for Global Responsibility (INES), Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), Verifica-tion Research, Training and Information Centre BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-8 (VERTIC), researchers from Bradford University, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the Sunshine Project, researchers from the University of Michigan, and the Quaker United Na-tions Office in Geneva, presented a variety of views, all stressing the need for a multilateral legally bind-ing instrument to strengthen the BTWC. The Conference commenced an article-by-article review of the convention’s operation and considered the issue of the work of the Verification Protocol AHG. The US delegation reportedly announced that it would not support the continuation of the AHG in any form. In contrast, the general view of other dele-gations was that the Group’s mandate remained in force and that the strengthening of the convention needed to take place in a multilateral setting and in a legally binding way. In particular, Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) countries asked for the reconven-ing of the Group to allow it to complete its task. Most States, including many Western countries, wanted to continue efforts to strengthen the convention, but did not indicate when, where, or how, or whether this meant they wanted to reconvene the AHG. The deliberations on the convention’s review were, by all accounts, conducted smoothly and without any major tension. All countries agreed that the Confe-rence was taking place at a critical juncture, and that rapid advances in science and technology posed chal-lenges to the BTWC regime that needed to be ad-dressed more frequently. Other matters discussed included the need to meet more frequently to respond to new challenges, and to agree to a follow-up mechanism for the Review Con-ference, e.g. annual meetings of States Parties, prepa-ratory committee meetings for the next Review Con-ference, and expert meetings. In the absence of an Organization for the Prohibition of Biological Wea-pons (OPBW), calls were also made for some kind of interim support structure to facilitate and advance the convention’s implementation. Iran expressed concern over the fact that the BTWC does not prohibit the use of BW and proposed that States Parties decide either to insert the word “use” in the convention’s title and Article 1, or require those countries, which still main-tain reservations to the Geneva Protocol, to withdraw them. Iran and others, including the European Union (EU), called on countries that maintained reservations to the Geneva Protocol to withdraw them. Russia reminded the States Parties that it had withdrawn its reservations on 6 December 2000. With respect to CBMs, the EU proposed that “some” of the political-ly binding CBMs be made legally-binding, but did not specify which. Canada regretted that participation in CBMs had been “disappointing,” saying that this highlighted “the shortcomings of a voluntary ap-proach” and that States Parties need “to get some law on our side.” South Africa proposed that States Par-ties declare facilities working with animal and plant pathogens as a CBM. The United Kingdom suggested additional CBMs and proposed to make some of them mandatory. The developing countries, in partic-ular, highlighted the importance of scientific and technical cooperation. During the second week of the Fifth BTWC Review Conference, delegations submitted their proposals on the language of the Final Declaration, after which the chair of the committee released an informal docu-ment outlining all the proposals and possibilities for common ground. Based on that document, which reproduced the language of the 1996 Final Declara-tion and the delegations’ proposals, the Drafting Committee was tasked with identifying acceptable formulations for the Final Declaration by 4 Decem-ber. The most controversial issues were export con-trols, scientific and technological cooperation, and the issue of possible clandestine BW programs in non-compliance with the convention, as well as ques-tions on how to deal with them. The Fifth Review Conference of BTWC was closed in disarray on the last day, 7 December, after the United States proposed the termination of the Ad Hoc Group. On the last day of the Conference, it was im-possible to get any agreement to adopt a final decla-ration or document containing measures to strengthen the BTWC. As a consequence, States Parties decided to adjourn the Conference to prevent outright failure until 11-22 November 2002, allowing a year-long “cooling-off” period. 2000: Four sessions of the Verification Protocol Ad Hoc Group were held during the year 2000: 17 Janu-ary-4 February, 3-13 March, 10 July-4 August and 13-24 November. The year 2000 was the sixth year of negotiations for an additional Protocol. During the year, the Parties were able to make slow but steady progress by clearing almost 50 percent of the brack-ets that were in place in 1999. However, due to the slow pace of the negotiations, some delegations, e.g., Australia, Brazil, and the EU, called for new working methods. Others, such as India, Iran, and Russia, un-derlined that the rolling text developed by July 1997 was to be the basis for negotiations and they were satisfied with the slower bracket-to-bracket approach. Different interpretations remained as to the AHG’s mandate and whether the Review Conference marked a deadline or a target date. Nevertheless, the delega-tions had less than seven weeks of negotiations left BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-9 before the Review Conference. There were concerns that missing the date could potentially unravel the whole process. To facilitate the work in the time re-maining, Ambassador Tibor Tóth of Hungary, the chair of the AHG, introduced the chair’s “composite text,” to “bring clarity to the outstanding issues.” The draft consisted of some 210 pages and included near-ly 1,200 “square brackets” signifying areas of disa-greement or disputed text. The main issues of contention were export controls, bio-defense cooperation, visits and investigations, technical cooperation, and compliance. On export controls, there were differing views between the Western Group and the NAM. Some NAM delega-tions wanted existing export control arrangements such as the Australia Group to be eliminated after the Protocol’s entry into force, while the Western Group supported the continuation of such arrangements. With respect to visits and investigations, the most important problem was the security of intellectual property rights and the confidentiality of business information. Pharmaceutical industries expressed support for simple declarations and objected to any routine on-site inspections. Many developing coun-tries underlined the importance of their right to enjoy the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material, and scientific and technological information related to the use of biological agents and toxins for peaceful purposes. Conversely, delegations from developed countries stressed the need for export control policies and to refrain from transferring any of the above-mentioned items. With regard to non-compliance, delegations were divided between “red light” and “green light” procedures for the initiation of investi-gations. 1996: The Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for the Fourth BTWC Review Conference met in Geneva, from 9-12 April. It decided that the Conference would be held in Geneva, from 25 November – 6 De-cember, and that Ambassador Michael Weston (UK) would be President of the Conference. The Confe-rence elected Ambassador Michael Weston as chair, Sola Ogunbanwo (Nigeria) as secretary-general, Am-bassador Jorge Berguno (Chile) chair of the Commit-tee of the Whole, and Ambassador Tibor Toth (Hun-gary) chair of the Drafting Committee. The 1996 BTWC Conference was attended by 138 States and focused on the scope and speed of progress on concluding a verification regime. The Final Declaration (BWC/CONF.IV/L.1) called for such a regime to be in place no later than 2001. Ne-gotiations on a Protocol to the BTWC to entail verifi-cation and compliance measures, as well as provi-sions for technical cooperation and cooperation on outbreaks of disease were underway in Geneva. It was hoped that the Protocol would be completed be-fore the Fifth BTWC Review Conference, to be held in Geneva in 2001. 1994: On 23 September, the Special Conference to consider verification measures for the BTWC was held in Geneva. The Conference decided to establish an AHG open to all States Parties. The objective of the AHG was to consider definitions of terms and objective criteria, to incorporate existing and en-hanced CBMs and transparency measures, to deter-mine appropriate measures, including possible verifi-cation measures, and draft proposals to strengthen the BTWC. Such proposals would be included, as appro-priate, in a legally binding instrument to be submitted for the consideration of the States Parties. 1993 and 1992: The AHG of Governmental Experts to Identify and Examine Verification Measures from a Scientific and Technical Standpoint (VEREX) held four sessions during which it identified 21 potential verification measures, and concluded in its report that some of the potential measures would contribute to strengthening the effectiveness and would improve the implementation of the convention. As was de-cided by the Third Review Conference, if a majority of States Parties asked for the convening of a confe-rence to examine the report, such a conference would be convened, and it would be preceded by a prepara-tory committee. An agreement was reached between Russia, the Unit-ed Kingdom, and the United States during 1992 giv-ing Parties access to their biological research facili-ties to check compliance with the BTWC. Under this agreement, reciprocal visits took place in 1993 and 1994. 1991: At the Third Review Conference, held from 9-27 September, delegates decided to establish an AHG of Governmental Experts (VEREX) to identify and examine potential verification measures from a scien-tific and technical standpoint. Delegates also adopted three new CBMs covering declarations of legislation and other legal and regulatory measures taken to im-plement the BTWC; declarations of past activities concerning defensive and/or offensive biological re-search and development programs; and declarations of facilities involved in the production of vaccines for humans. 1986: The Second Review Conference, held from 8-26 September, sought to increase transparency through a set of CBMs in the form of politically bind-ing data exchanges. Delegates agreed on the follow- BTWC Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes © Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Update: 6/22/2009 BTWC-10 ing CBMs: an exchange of data on research centers and laboratories containing bio-safety level 4 con-tainment facilities; efforts to encourage publications concerning biological research of direct relevance to the convention; information exchanges regarding outbreaks of infectious diseases; and the development of contacts between scientists engaged in research related to the terms of the convention. 1980: The First Review Conference was held in Ge-neva from 3-21 March under the provisions of Article XII to review the operation of the convention and to assure that the purposes of the preamble and the pro-visions of the convention were being realized.

Such aircraft and boats shall be covered by temporary importation papers guaranteeing</p><p>payment of import duties and import taxes, and if the case should arise, of any Customs penalties</p><p>incurred, subject to the special provision of paragraph 4 of Article 27.</p><p>Article 3</p><p>The fuel contained in the supply tanks of aircraft and boats temporarily imported shall be</p><p>admitted without payment of import duties and import taxes and free of import prohibitions and</p><p>restrictions, provided that the supply tanks are of normal capacity, are located in the usual places</p><p>and are connected to the engine, it being understood that the fuel contained in these tanks is</p><p>intended exclusively for consumption by the aircraft or boat.</p><p>Article 4</p><p>1.

Temporary importation papers may be valid for a single country or Customs territory or</p><p>for several countries or Customs territories.</p><p>3. The period of validity of these papers shall not exceed one year from the date of issue.</p><p>Article 7</p><p>1. Temporary importation papers valid for the territories of all or several of the Contracting</p><p>Parties shall be known as carnets de passages en douane and shall conform in respect of aircraft</p><p>to the standard form contained in Annex 1, and, in respect of boats, to the standard form</p><p>contained in Annex 2, to this Convention.</p><p>2. If a carnet de passages en douane is not valid for one or several territories, the issuing</p><p>association shall indicate the fact on the cover and on the importation vouchers of the carnet.</p><p>3. Temporary importation papers intended for boats and valid only for the territory of a</p><p>single Contracting Party may conform to the standard form contained in Annex 3 to this</p><p>Convention. Contracting Parties may also use other documents, in accordance with their</p><p>legislation or regulations.</p><p>4. The period of validity of temporary importation papers other than those issued by</p><p>authorized associations as provided for in Article 6 shall be laid down by each Contracting Party</p><p>in accordance with its legislation or regulations.</p><p>5. Each Contracting Party shall, upon request, supply the other Contracting Parties with</p><p>models of temporary importation papers valid for its territory, other than those appearing in the</p><p>Annexes to this Convention.</p><p>Chapter IV</p><p>PARTICULARS ON TEMPORARY IMPORTATION PAPERS</p><p>Article 8</p><p>Temporary importation papers issued by authorized associations shall be made out in the</p><p>name of the persons who own the aircraft or boats temporarily imported or who have the</p><p>possession or control of them. When such papers, issued in respect of hired aircraft or boats are</p><p>made out in the name of the person letting out on hire, the words “ON HIRE TO …” followed by</p><p>the name and the address of the normal residence in a foreign country of the person concerned,</p><p>shall, when the Customs authorities of the country of temporary importation so require, be</p><p>inserted on all counterfoils and vouchers used in connection with the journeys of the person</p><p>taking the aircraft or boat on hire.</p><p>– 6 –</p><p>Article 9</p><p>1. The weight to be declared on temporary importation papers is the net weight of aircraft or</p><p>boats. It shall be expressed in the metric system. In the case of papers valid for one country</p><p>only, the Customs authorities of that country may prescribe the use of another system.</p><p>2. The value to be declared on temporary importation papers valid for one country only</p><p>shall be expressed in the currency of that country. The value to be declared on a carnet de</p><p>passages en douane shall be expressed in the currency of the country where the carnet is issued.</p><p>3. The articles and tool-kit which form the normal equipment of aircraft or boats need not</p><p>be specially declared on the temporary importation papers.</p><p>4. When the Customs authorities so require, spare parts and accessories not considered as</p><p>constituting the normal equipment of the aircraft or boat shall be declared on the temporary</p><p>importation papers with the necessary particulars (such as weight and value) and shall be</p><p>produced on exit from the country visited.</p><p>Article 10</p><p>Any particulars inserted on temporary importation papers by the issuing association may</p><p>be altered only with the approval of the issuing or guaranteeing association. No alteration to the</p><p>papers may be made after they have been passed by the Customs authorities of the country of</p><p>importation except with the consent of those authorities.</p><p>Chapter V</p><p>CONDITIONS OF TEMPORARY IMPORTATION</p><p>Article 11</p><p>1. Aircraft and boats admitted under cover of temporary importation papers may be used,</p><p>for their private use, by third persons duly authorized by the holders of the papers, provided that</p><p>those third persons normally reside outside the country of importation and also fulfil the other</p><p>conditions laid down in this Convention. The Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties</p><p>shall have the right to require evidence that such third persons have been duly authorized by the</p><p>holders of the papers and fulfil the aforesaid conditions. If this evidence does not appear</p><p>sufficient, the Customs authorities may refuse use of these aircraft and boats in their country</p><p>under cover of the papers. In the case of aircraft or boats which have been hired, each</p><p>Contracting Party may require that the person taking the aircraft or boat on hire be present at the</p><p>time of importation of the aircraft or boat.</p><p>– 7 –</p><p>2. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the Customs authorities of</p><p>the Contracting Parties may permit, under conditions of which they shall be the sole judges, an</p><p>aircraft or boat circulating under cover of temporary importation papers to be manned by a crew</p><p>composed of persons who are normally resident in the country of importation, in particular when</p><p>the crew of the aircraft or boat acts on behalf of or under instructions from the holder of the</p><p>temporary importation papers.</p><p>Article 12</p><p>1. Aircraft or boats mentioned in temporary importation papers shall be re-exported in the</p><p>same general state, except for wear and tear, within the period of validity of such papers. In the</p><p>case of aircraft or boats which have been hired, the Customs authorities of the Contracting</p><p>Parties shall have the right to require the re-exportation of the aircraft or boat as soon as the hirer</p><p>has left the country of temporary importation.</p><p>2. Evidence of re-exportation shall be provided by the exit visa properly appended to the</p><p>temporary importation papers by the Customs authorities of the country into which the aircraft or</p><p>boat was temporarily imported.</p><p>3. Contracting Parties may, however, make the discharge of temporary importation papers</p><p>for aircraft subject to proof of the arrival of the aircraft in foreign territory.</p><p>Article 13</p><p>1. Notwithstanding the requirement of re-exportation laid down in Article 12, the</p><p>re-exportation of badly damaged aircraft or boats shall not be required, in the case of duly</p><p>authenticated accidents, provided that the aircraft or boats:</p><p>(a) are subjected to the import duties and import taxes to which they are liable; or</p><p>(b) are abandoned free of all expense to the Exchequer of the country into which they</p><p>were imported temporarily; or</p><p>(c) are destroyed, under official supervision, at the expense of the parties concerned,</p><p>any salvaged parts and materials being subjected to the import duties and import</p><p>taxes to which they are liable,</p><p>as the Customs authorities may require.</p><p>2. When an aircraft or boat temporarily imported cannot be re-exported as a result of a</p><p>seizure, other than a seizure made at the suit of private persons, the requirement of re-exportation</p><p>within the period of validity of the temporary importation papers shall be suspended for the</p><p>duration of the seizure.</p><p>– 8 –</p><p>3. The Customs authorities shall notify, so far as possible, to the guaranteeing association,</p><p>seizures made by or on behalf of those Customs authorities of aircraft or boats admitted under</p><p>cover of temporary importation papers guaranteed by that association and shall advise it of the</p><p>measures they intend to take.</p><p>Article 14</p><p>An aircraft or boat imported into the territory of one of the Contracting Parties under</p><p>cover of temporary importation papers may not be used, even incidentally, for transport against</p><p>remuneration, reward or other consideration between points within the frontiers of that territory</p><p>or outwards from that territory. It may not be hired out after importation and if it was imported</p><p>on hire it may not be re-hired to any person other than the person who hired it originally.</p><p>Article 15</p><p>Persons entitled to temporary importation facilities may, during the period of validity of</p><p>temporary importation papers, import the aircraft or boats covered by those papers as often as</p><p>necessary, on condition that they have each passage (entry and exit) established by a visa of the</p><p>Customs officers concerned if the Customs authorities so require. Temporary importation papers</p><p>may however be made valid for a single journey only.</p><p>Article 16</p><p>When temporary importation papers without detachable vouchers for each passage are</p><p>used for boats, the visas given by the Customs officers between the first entry and the final exit</p><p>shall be provisional. Nevertheless, when the last visa is a provisional exit visa, it shall be</p><p>admitted as proof of the re-exportation of the boat or component parts temporarily imported.</p><p>Article 17</p><p>When temporary importation papers with a detachable voucher for each passage are used,</p><p>each entry visa implies the passing of the document by the Customs authorities, and each</p><p>subsequent exit visa constitutes its final discharge, except as provided in Article 18.</p><p>Article 18</p><p>When the Customs authorities of a country have finally and unconditionally discharged</p><p>temporary importation papers they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association</p><p>payment of import duties and import taxes, unless the certificate of discharge was obtained</p><p>improperly or fraudulently.</p><p>– 9 –</p><p>Article 19</p><p>Visas on temporary importation papers used under the conditions laid down in this</p><p>Convention shall not be subject to the payment of charges for Customs attendance, provided</p><p>such visas are issued at a Customs office or post during athorized hours.</p><p>Chapter VI</p><p>EXTENSION OF VALIDITY AND RENEWAL OF</p><p>TEMPORARY IMPORTATION PAPERS</p><p>Article 20</p><p>The lack of proof of re-exportation within the time allowed of aircraft or boats</p><p>temporarily imported shall be disregarded when the aircraft or boats are presented to the</p><p>Customs authorities for re-exportation within fourteen days from the expiry of the papers and</p><p>satisfactory explanations of the delay are given.</p><p>Article 21</p><p>Each of the Contracting Parties shall recognize as valid extensions of validity of carnets</p><p>de passages en douane granted by another Contracting  State in accordance with the procedure</p><p>laid down in Annex 4 to this Convention.</p><p>Article 22</p><p>1. Requests for extension of validity of temporary importation papers shall be presented to</p><p>the competent Customs authorities before the expiry of the period of validity of these papers,</p><p>unless this is rendered impossible by force majeure. If the temporary importation papers have</p><p>been issued by an authorized association, the request for extension shall be made by the</p><p>association which guarantees the papers.</p><p>2. Extensions of time necessary for the re-exportation of aircraft or boats or component</p><p>parts imported temporarily shall be granted when the persons concerned can establish to the</p><p>satisfaction of the Customs authorities that they are prevented by force majeure from</p><p>re-exporting the said aircraft, boats or component parts within the time allowed.</p><p>Article 23</p><p>Each of the Contracting Parties shall, unless the conditions of temporary admission are</p><p>no longer satisfied, authorize, subject to whatever measures of control it may consider necessary,</p><p>the renewal of temporary importation papers issued by the authorized associations and relating to</p><p>aircraft, boats or component parts temporarily imported into its territory. Requests for renewal</p><p>shall be presented by the guaranteeing association.</p><p>– 10 –</p><p>Chapter VII</p><p>REGULARIZATION OF TEMPORARY IMPORTATION PAPERS</p><p>Article 24</p><p>1. If temporary importation papers have not been regularly discharged, the Customs</p><p>authorities of the country of importation shall (whether the papers have expired or not) accept as</p><p>evidence of re-exportation of the aircraft, boats or component parts the presentation of a</p><p>certificate based on the standard form shown in Annex 5 to this Convention, issued by an official</p><p>authority (consul, Customs, police, mayor, judicial officer, etc.), attesting the facts that the</p><p>aircraft, boat or component parts in question have been presented to it and are outside the</p><p>country of importation. The said Customs authorities may also accept any other documentary</p><p>evidence that the aircraft, boat or component parts are outside the country of importation. In the</p><p>case of papers, other than carnets de passages en douane, which have not expired, the said</p><p>Customs authorities may required the papers to be surrendered to them before the date on which</p><p>the aircraft or boat in question was certified to be outside the country of temporary importation.</p><p>In the case of carnets, account shall be taken, as evidence of re-exportation of the aircraft, boats,</p><p>or component parts, of the visas entered thereon by the Customs authorities of countries</p><p>subsequently visited.</p><p>2. In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of temporary importation papers not regularly</p><p>discharged but relating to aircraft, boats or component parts which have been re-exported, the</p><p>Customs authorities of the country of importation shall accept as proof of re-exportation the</p><p>presentation of certificates based on the standard form shown in Annex 5 to this Convention</p><p>issued by an official authority (consul, Customs, police, mayor, judicial officer, etc.), attesting</p><p>the facts that the aircraft, boats or component parts in question have been presented to it and are</p><p>outside the country of importation after the date of expiry of the papers. They may also accept</p><p>any other documentary evidence that the aircraft, boats or component parts are outside the</p><p>country of temporary importation.</p><p>3. In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of carnets de passages en douane while</p><p>aircraft, boats or component parts to which they refer are in the territory of one of the</p><p>Contracting Parties, the Customs authorities of that Party shall, at the request of the association</p><p>concerned, accept replacement documents the validity of which shall expire on the date of expiry</p><p>of the validity of the carnets which they replace. This acceptance will annul the previous</p><p>– 11 –</p><p>acceptance of the carnets destroyed, lost or stolen. If, instead of replacement documents, export</p><p>licences or similar documents are issued for the re-exportation of the aircraft, boats or</p><p>component parts, the exit visas on these licences or documents shall be considered as sufficient</p><p>proof of re-exportation.</p><p>4. If aircraft or boats are stolen after having been re-exported from the country of</p><p>importation, without the exit having been regularly endorsed on the temporary importation</p><p>papers and in the absence of entry visas on the papers entered thereon by the Customs authorities</p><p>of countries subsequently visited, the papers may nevertheless be regularized provided that the</p><p>guaranteeing association furnishes the papers together with such evidence of theft as may be</p><p>considered sufficient. If the temporary importation papers have not expired, the Customs</p><p>authorities may require their surrender.</p><p>Article 25</p><p>In the cases referred to in Article 24, the Customs authorities shall have the right to</p><p>charge a regularization fee.</p><p>Article 26</p><p>Customs authorities shall not have the right to require from the guaranteeing association</p><p>payment of import duties and import taxes on aircraft, boats or component parts temporarily</p><p>imported when the non-discharge of the temporary importation papers has not been notified to</p><p>the guaranteeing association within one year of the date of expiry of the validity of those papers.</p><p>Article 27</p><p>1. The guaranteeing associations shall have a period of one year from the date of</p><p>notification of the non-discharge of temporary importation papers in which to furnish proof of</p><p>the re-exportation of the aircraft, boats or component parts in question under the conditions laid</p><p>down in this Convention.</p><p>2. If such proof is not furnished within the time allowed, the guaranteeing association shall</p><p>forthwith deposit or pay provisionally the import duties and import taxes payable. This deposit</p><p>or payment shall become final after a period of one year from the date of the deposit or</p><p>provisional payment. During the latter period, the guaranteeing association may still avail itself</p><p>of the facilities provided by the preceding paragraph with a view to repayment of the sums</p><p>deposited or paid.</p><p>– 12 –</p><p>3. For countries whose regulations do not provide for the deposit or provisional payment of</p><p>import duties and import taxes, payments made in conformity with the provisions of the</p><p>preceding paragraph will be regarded as final, it being understood that the sums paid may be</p><p>refunded when the conditions laid down in this article are fulfilled.</p><p>4. In the case of the non-discharge of temporary importation papers, the guaranteeing</p><p>association shall not be required to pay a sum greater than the total of the import duties and</p><p>import taxes applicable to the aircraft, boats or component parts not re-exported, together with</p><p>interest if applicable.</p><p>Article 28</p><p>The provisions of this Convention do not affect the right of the Contracting Parties, in the</p><p>event of fraud, contravention or abuse, to take proceedings against holders of, or the persons</p><p>using, temporary importation papers, for the recovery of the import duties and import taxes and</p><p>also to impose any penalties to which such persons have rendered themselves liable. In such</p><p>cases, the guaranteeing associations shall lend their assistance to the Customs authorities.</p><p>Chapter VIII</p><p>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</p><p>Article 29</p><p>The Contracting Parties shall endeavour not to introduce Customs procedures which</p><p>might have the effect of impeding the development of international touring.</p><p>Article 30</p><p>Any breach of the provisions of this Convention, any substitution, false declaration or act</p><p>having the effect of causing a person or an article improperly to benefit from the system of</p><p>importation laid down in this Convention, may render the offender liable in the country where</p><p>the offence was committed to the penalties prescribed by the laws of that country.</p><p>Article 31</p><p>Nothing in this Convention shall prevent Contracting Parties which form a Customs or economic</p><p>union from enacting special provisions applicable to persons normally resident in the countries</p><p>forming that union.</p><p>– 13 –</p><p>Article 32</p><p>Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to prejudice the right of each Contracting</p><p>Party to apply import prohibitions or restrictions based on considerations other than economic in</p><p>character, for example considerations of public morality, public security, public health or</p><p>hygiene.</p><p>Chapter IX</p><p>FINAL PROVISIONS</p><p>Article 33</p><p>1. Countries members of the Economic Commission for Europe and countries admitted to</p><p>the Commission in a consultative capacity under paragraph 8 of the Commission’s Terms of</p><p>Reference, may become Contracting Parties to this Convention:</p><p>(a) by signing it;</p><p>(b) by ratifying it after signing it subject to ratification;</p><p>(c) by acceding to it.</p><p>2. Such countries as may participate in certain activities of the Economic Commission for</p><p>Europe in accordance with paragraph 11 of the Commission’s Terms of Reference may become</p><p>Contracting Parties to this Convention by acceding thereto after its entry into force.</p><p>3. The Convention shall be open for signature until 31 August 1956 inclusive. Thereafter, it</p><p>shall be open for accession.</p><p>4. Ratification or accession shall be effected by the deposit of an instrument with the</p><p>Secretary-General of the United Nations</p><p>Article 34</p><p>1. This Convention shall come into force on the ninetieth day after five of the countries</p><p>referred to in article 33, paragraph 1, have signed it without reservation of ratification or have</p><p>deposited their instruments of ratification or accession.</p><p>2. For any country ratifying or acceding to it after five countries have signed it without</p><p>reservation of ratification or have deposited their instruments of ratification or accession, this</p><p>Convention shall enter into force on the ninetieth day after the said country has deposited its</p><p>instrument of ratification or accession.</p><p>Article 35</p><p>1. Any Contracting Party may denounce this Convention by so notifying the</p><p>Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p><p>– 14 –</p><p>2. Denunciation shall take effect fifteen months after the date of receipt by the</p><p>Secretary-General of the notification of denunciation.</p><p>3. The validity of temporary importation papers issued before the date when the</p><p>denunciation takes effect shall not be affected thereby and the guarantee of the association shall</p><p>hold good. Extensions granted in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 21 of this</p><p>Convention shall similarly remain valid.</p><p>Article 36</p><p>This Convention shall cease to have effect if, for any period of twelve consecutive</p><p>months after its entry into force, the number of Contracting Parties is less than five.</p><p>Article 37</p><p>1.

Any country which has made a declaration under the preceding paragraph extending this</p><p>Convention to any territory for whose international relations it is responsible may denounce the</p><p>Convention separately in respect of that territory in accordance with the provisions of Article 35.</p><p>Article 38</p><p>1. Any dispute between two or more Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or</p><p>application of this Convention shall so far as possible be settled by negotiation between them.</p><p>2. Any dispute which is not settled by negotiation shall be submitted to arbitration if any</p><p>one of the Contracting Parties in dispute so requests and shall be referred accordingly to one or</p><p>more arbitrators selected by agreement between the Parties in dispute. If within three months</p><p>from the date of the request for arbitration the Parties in dispute are unable to agree on the</p><p>selection of an arbitrator or arbitrators, any of those Parties may request the Secretary-General of</p><p>the United Nations to nominate a single arbitrator to whom the dispute shall be referred for</p><p>decision.</p><p>3.

Subject to such conditions as the Customs authorities may impose, the driver and other members of</p><p>the crew of the vehicle shall be allowed to import temporarily a reasonable quantity of personal effects, having</p><p>regard to the period of stay in the country of importation.</p><p>2. Provisions for the journey and small quantities of tobacco, cigars and cigarettes for personal</p><p>consumption, shall be admitted free of import duties and import taxes.</p><p>Article 4</p><p>The fuel contained in the ordinary supply tanks of vehicles temporarily imported shall be admitted</p><p>without payment of import duties and import taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions. Each</p><p>Contracting Party may however fix maximum quantities for the fuel so admitted into its territory in the supply</p><p>tanks of the vehicles temporarily imported.</p><p>Article 5</p><p>1. Component parts imported for the repair of a particular vehicle already temporarily imported shall be</p><p>admitted temporarily without payment of import duties and import taxes and free of import prohibitions and</p><p>restrictions. Contracting Parties may require these parts to be covered by temporary importation papers.</p><p>2. Replaced parts which are not re-exported shall be liable to import duties and import taxes except</p><p>where, in conformity with the regulations of the country concerned, they may be abandoned free of all</p><p>expense to the Exchequer or destroyed, under official supervision, at the expense of the Parties concerned.</p><p>Article 6</p><p>Temporary importation papers and international circulation papers sent to associations authorized to</p><p>issue the papers in question by the corresponding foreign associations, by international organizations or by the</p><p>Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties, shall be admitted without payment of import duties and import</p><p>taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions.</p><p><strong>-5-</strong></p><p>CHAPTER III – ISSUE OF TEMPORARY IMPORTATION PAPERS</p><p>Article 7</p><p>l. Subject to such guarantees and under such conditions as it may determine, each Contracting Party</p><p>may authorize associations, such as those affiliated to an international organization, to issue either directly or</p><p>through corresponding associations the temporary importation papers covered by this Convention.</p><p>2. Temporary importation papers may be valid for a single country or Customs territory, or for several</p><p>countries or Customs territories.</p><p>3. The period of validity of these papers shall not exceed one year from the date of issue.</p><p>Article 8</p><p>l. Temporary importation papers valid for the territories of all or several of the Contracting Parties shall</p><p>be known as “carnets de passages en douane” and shall conform to the standard form contained in Annex 1</p><p>to this Convention.</p><p>2. If a “carnet de passages en douane” is not valid for one or several territories, the issuing association</p><p>shall indicate the fact on the cover and on the importation vouchers of the carnet.</p><p>3. Temporary importation papers valid only for the territory of a single Contracting Party may conform</p><p>to the standard form contained in Annex 2 of this Convention. Contracting Parties may also use other</p><p>documents, in accordance with their legislation or regulations.</p><p>4. The period of validity of temporary importation papers, other than those issued by authorized</p><p>associations as provided for in Article 7, shall be laid down by each Contracting Party in accordance with its</p><p>legislation or regulations.</p><p>5. Each Contracting Party shall, upon request, supply the other Contracting Parties with models of</p><p>temporary importation papers valid for its territory, other than those appearing in the annexes to this</p><p>Convention.</p><p>CHAPTER IV – PARTICULARS ON TEMPORARY IMPORTATION PAPERS</p><p>Article 9</p><p>Temporary importation papers issued by authorized associations shall be made out in the name of the</p><p>undertakings operating and temporarily importing the vehicles.</p><p><strong>-6-</strong></p><p>Article 10</p><p>1. The weight to be declared on temporary importation papers is the net weight of the vehicles. It shall</p><p>be expressed in the metric system. In the case of papers valid for one country only, the Customs authorities</p><p>of that country may prescribe the use of another system.</p><p>2. The value to be declared on temporary importation papers valid for one country only shall be</p><p>expressed in the currency of that country. The value to be declared on a “carnet de passages en douane” shall</p><p>be expressed in the currency of the country where the carnet is issued.</p><p>3. The Articles and tool- kit which form the normal equipment of vehicles need not be specially declared</p><p>on temporary importation papers.</p><p>4. When the Customs authorities so require, spare parts (such as wheels, tyres and inner tubes) and</p><p>accessories not considered as constituting the normal equipment of the vehicle (such as radio sets and luggage</p><p>carriers) shall be declared on temporary importation papers with the necessary particulars (such as weight and</p><p>value) and shall be produced on exit from the country visited.</p><p>5. Trailers shall be covered by separate importation papers.</p><p>Article 11</p><p>Any particulars inserted on temporary importation papers by the issuing associations may be altered</p><p>only with the approval of the issuing or guaranteeing association. No alteration to the papers may be made</p><p>after they have been passed by the Customs authorities of the country of importation except with the consent</p><p>of those authorities.</p><p>CHAPTER V – CONDITIONS OF TEMPORARY IMPORTATION</p><p>Article 12</p><p>Without prejudice to the application of the provisions of national legislations enabling the Customs</p><p>authorities of the Contracting Parties to refuse to allow vehicles admitted under cover of temporary importation</p><p>papers to be driven by persons who have been guilty of serious offences against the Customs or fiscal laws</p><p>or regulations of the country of temporary importation, vehicles admitted under cover of temporary</p><p>importation papers may be driven by persons duly authorized by the holders of the papers. The Customs</p><p>authorities of the Contracting Parties shall have the right to require evidence that such persons have been duly</p><p>authorized by the holders of the papers; if this evidence does not appear sufficient, the Customs authorities</p><p>may refuse use of these vehicles in their country under cover of the papers.</p><p>Article 13</p><p>1. Vehicles mentioned in temporary importation papers shall be re-exported in the same general state,</p><p>except for wear and tear, within the period of validity of such papers.</p><p><strong>-7-</strong></p><p>2. Evidence of re-exportation shall be provided by the exit visa properly appended to the temporary</p><p>importation papers by the Customs authorities of the country into which the vehicle was temporarily imported.</p><p>3. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to deny the benefit of temporary importation without</p><p>payment of import duties and import taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions to, or to withdraw</p><p>that benefit from, vehicles which are used, even occasionally, for the purpose of picking up passengers or</p><p>goods within the frontiers of the country into which the vehicle is imported, for deposit within those frontiers.</p><p>4. A hired vehicle temporarily imported under the terms of this Convention shall not be re-hired in the</p><p>country of temporary importation to any persons other than the persons who hired it originally, and the</p><p>Customs authorities of the Contracting Parties shall have the right to require that such a vehicle shall be reexported</p><p>when the transport operations for which it has been temporarily imported have been completed.</p><p>Article 14</p><p>1. Notwithstanding the requirement of re-exportation laid down in Article 13, the re-exportation of badly</p><p>damaged vehicles shall not be required, in the case of duly authenticated accidents, provided that the vehicles:</p><p>(a) are subjected to the import duties and import taxes to which they are liable; or</p><p>(b) are abandoned free of all expenses to the Exchequer of the country into which they were</p><p>imported temporarily, in which case the holder of the temporary importation papers shall be exempt from</p><p>import duties and import taxes; or</p><p>(c) are destroyed, under official supervision, at the expense of the Parties concerned, any</p><p>salvaged parts and materials being subjected to the import duties and import taxes to which they are liable, as</p><p>the Customs authorities may require.</p><p>2. When a vehicle temporarily imported cannot be re-exported as a result of a seizure, other than a</p><p>seizure made at the suit of private persons, the requirement of re-exportation within the period of validity of</p><p>the temporary importation papers shall be suspended for the duration of the seizure.</p><p>3. The Customs authorities shall notify, so far as possible, to the guaranteeing association, seizures made</p><p>by or on behalf of those Customs authorities of vehicles admitted under cover of temporary importation papers</p><p>guaranteed by that association and shall advise it of the measures they intend to take.</p><p>4. When the vehicle or the object listed in the papers are either lost or stolen during the course of the</p><p>seizure other than a seizure made at the suit of private persons, no import duties or import taxes can be levied</p><p>against the holder of the temporary importation papers, who should submit evidence of seizure to the Customs</p><p>authorities.</p><p>Article 15</p><p>Persons entitled to temporary importation facilities may, during the period of validity of temporary</p><p>importation papers, import the vehicles covered by those papers as often as necessary, on condition that they</p><p>have each passage (entry and exit) established by a visa of the Customs officers concerned if the Customs</p><p>authorities so require. Temporary importation papers may however be made valid for a single journey only.</p><p><strong>-8-</strong></p><p>Article 16</p><p>When temporary importation papers without detachable vouchers for each passage are used, the visas</p><p>given by the Customs officers between the first entry and the final exit are provisional. Nevertheless, when</p><p>the last visa is a provisional exit visa, it will be admitted as proof of the re-exportation of the vehicle or</p><p>component parts temporarily imported.</p><p>Article 17</p><p>When temporary importation papers with a detachable voucher for each passage are used, each entry</p><p>visa implies the passing of the document by the Customs authorities and each subsequent exit visa constitutes</p><p>its final discharge, except as provided in Article 18.</p><p>Article 18</p><p>When the Customs authorities of a country have finally and unconditionally discharged temporary</p><p>importation papers they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association payment of import duties and</p><p>import taxes, unless the certificate of discharge was obtained improperly or fraudulently.</p><p>Article 19</p><p>Visas on temporary importation papers used under the conditions laid down in this Convention shall</p><p>not be subject to the payment of charges for Customs attendance provided such visas are issued at a Customs</p><p>office or post during authorized hours.</p><p>CHAPTER VI – EXTENSION OF VALIDITY AND</p><p>RENEWAL OF TEMPORARY IMPORTATION PAPERS</p><p>Article 20</p><p>The lack of proof of re-exportation within the time allowed of vehicles temporarily imported shall be</p><p>disregarded when the vehicles are presented to the Customs authorities for re-exportation within fourteen days</p><p>from the expiry of the temporary entry deadline for the vehicles and satisfactory explanations of the delay are</p><p>given.</p><p>Article 21</p><p>Each of the Contracting Parties shall recognize as valid extensions of validity of “carnets de passages</p><p>en douane” granted by another Contracting Party in accordance with the procedure laid down in Annex 3 to</p><p>this Convention.</p><p><strong>-9-</strong></p><p>Article 22</p><p>1. Requests for extension of validity of temporary importation papers shall be presented to the</p><p>competent Customs authorities before the expiry of the period of validity of these papers, unless this is</p><p>rendered impossible by force majeure. If the temporary importation papers have been issued by an authorized</p><p>association, the request for extension shall be made by the association which guarantees the papers.</p><p>2. Extensions of time necessary for the re-exportation of vehicles or component parts imported</p><p>temporarily shall be granted when the persons concerned can establish to the satisfaction of the Customs</p><p>authorities that they are prevented by force majeure from re-exporting the said vehicles or component parts</p><p>within the time allowed.</p><p>3. The validity of temporary importation papers can only be extended once for not more than one year.</p><p>After this period, a new carnet must be issued and delivered in replacement of the former carnet.</p><p>Article 23</p><p>Each of the Contracting Parties shall, unless the conditions of temporary admission are no longer</p><p>satisfied, authorize, subject to whatever measures of control it may consider necessary, the renewal of</p><p>temporary importation papers issued by the authorized associations and relating to vehicles or component parts</p><p>temporarily imported into its territory. Requests for renewal shall be presented by the guaranteeing</p><p>association.</p><p>CHAPTER VII – REGULARIZATION OF TEMPORARY IMPORTATION PAPERS</p><p>Article 24</p><p>1. If temporary importation papers have not been regularly discharged, the Customs authorities of the</p><p>country of importation shall (whether the papers have expired or not) accept as evidence of re-exportation of</p><p>the vehicle or component parts the presentation of a certificate based on the standard form shown in Annex</p><p>4 to this Convention, issued by an official authority (consul, Customs, police, mayor, judicial officer etc.),</p><p>attesting the facts that the vehicle or component parts in question have been presented to it and are outside</p><p>the country of importation. As an alternative they shall accept any other valid documentary evidence that the</p><p>vehicle or component parts are outside the country of temporary importation. In the case of papers, other</p><p>than the “carnets de passages en douane”, which have not expired, the papers shall be produced at the same</p><p>time as the evidence referred to above. In the case of carnets the Customs authorities shall accept, as</p><p>evidence of re-exportation of the vehicles or component parts, the visas entered thereon by the Customs</p><p>authorities of countries subsequently visited.</p><p>2. In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of temporary importation papers not regularly discharged</p><p>but relating to vehicles or component parts which have been re-exported, the Customs authorities of the</p><p>country of importation shall accept as proof of re-exportation the presentation of certificates based on the</p><p><strong>-10-</strong></p><p>standard form shown in Annex 4 to this Convention issued by an official authority (consul, Customs, police,</p><p>mayor, judicial officer etc.), attesting the facts that the vehicles or component parts in question have been</p><p>presented to it and are outside the country of importation after the date of expiry of the papers. As an</p><p>alternative they shall accept any other valid documentary evidence that the vehicle or component parts are</p><p>outside the country of temporary importation.</p><p>3. In the case of the destruction, loss or theft of “carnets de passages en douane” while vehicles or</p><p>component parts to which they refer are in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, the Customs</p><p>authorities of that Party shall, at the request of the association concerned, accept replacement documents, the</p><p>validity of which shall expire on the date of expiry of the validity of the carnets which they replace. This</p><p>acceptance will annul the previous acceptance of the carnets destroyed, lost or stolen. In case of the misuse</p><p>of a carnet after cancellation by the Customs authorities and the issuing association, the latter cannot be held</p><p>responsible for import duties and import taxes payable. If, instead of replacement documents, export licences</p><p>or similar documents are issued for the re-exportation of the vehicles or component parts, the exit visas on</p><p>these licences or documents shall be considered as sufficient proof of re-exportation.</p><p>4. If vehicles are stolen after having been re-exported from the country of temporary importation,</p><p>without the exit having been regularly endorsed on the temporary importation papers and in the absence of</p><p>entry visas on the papers entered thereon by the Customs authorities of countries subsequently visited, the</p><p>papers may nevertheless be regularized provided that the guaranteeing association furnishes the papers together</p><p>with such evidence of theft as may be considered sufficient. If the temporary importation papers have not</p><p>expired, the Customs authorities may require their surrender.</p><p>Article 25</p><p>In the case referred to in Article 24, the Customs authorities shall have the right to charge a</p><p>regularization fee.</p><p>Article 25 bis</p><p>The competent Customs authorities shall not require payment of import duties and import taxes where</p><p>it is proved to their satisfaction that a vehicle imported under cover of temporary importation papers can no</p><p>longer be re-exported because it has been destroyed or irrecoverably lost for reasons of force majeure, in</p><p>particular on account of acts of war, riots or natural disasters.</p><p>Article 26</p><p>Customs authorities shall not have the right to require from the guaranteeing association payment of</p><p>import duties and import taxes on vehicles or component parts temporarily imported when the non-discharge</p><p>of the temporary importation papers has not been notified to the guaranteeing association within one year of</p><p>the date of expiry of the validity of those papers. The Customs authorities shall provide the guaranteeing</p><p>associations with details of the amount of import duties and import taxes within one year from the notification</p><p>of the non-discharge. The guaranteeing associations’ liability for these sums shall cease if such information</p><p>is not furnished within this one-year period.</p><p><strong>-11-</strong></p><p>Article 27</p><p>1. The guaranteeing associations shall have a period of one year from the date of notification of the nondischarge</p><p>of temporary importation papers in which to furnish proof of the re-exportation of the vehicles or</p><p>component parts in question under the conditions laid down in this Convention. Nevertheless, this period can</p><p>come into force only as of the date of expiry of the temporary importation papers. If the Customs authorities</p><p>contest the validity of the proof provided they must so inform the guarantor within a period not exceeding one</p><p>year.</p><p>2. If such proof is not furnished within the time limit allowed, the guaranteeing association shall deposit</p><p>or pay provisionally within a maximum period of three months the import duties and import taxes payable.</p><p>This deposit or payment shall become final after a period of one year from the date of the deposit or</p><p>provisional payment. During the latter period, the guaranteeing association may still avail itself of the facilities</p><p>provided by the preceding paragraph with a view to repayment of the sums deposited or paid.</p><p>3. For countries whose regulations do not provide for the deposit or provisional payment of import duties</p><p>and import taxes, payments made in conformity with the provisions of the preceding paragraph will be</p><p>regarded as final, it being understood that the sums paid may be refunded when the conditions laid down in</p><p>this Article are fulfilled.</p><p>4. In the case of the non-discharge of temporary importation papers, the guaranteeing association shall</p><p>not be required to pay a sum greater than the total of the import duties and import taxes applicable to the</p><p>vehicles or component parts not re-exported, together with interest if applicable.</p><p>Article 28</p><p>The provisions of this Convention do not affect the right of the Contracting Parties, in the event of</p><p>fraud, contravention or abuse, to take proceedings against holders of, or the persons using, temporary</p><p>importation papers, for the recovery of the import duties and import taxes and also to impose any penalties</p><p>to which such persons have rendered themselves liable. In such cases, the guaranteeing associations shall lend</p><p>their assistance to the Customs authorities.</p><p>CHAPTER VIII – MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</p><p>Article 29</p><p>The Contracting Parties shall endeavour not to introduce Customs procedures which have the effect</p><p>of impeding the development of international commercial road traffic.</p><p>Article 30</p><p>In order to expedite Customs procedures contiguous Contracting Parties shall endeavour to place their</p><p>respective Customs offices and posts close together and to keep them open during the same hours.</p><p><strong>-12-</strong></p><p>Article 31</p><p>Any breach of the provisions of this Convention, any substitution, false declaration or act having the</p><p>effect of causing a person or an Article improperly to benefit from the system of importation laid down in this</p><p>Convention, may render the offender liable in the country where the offence was committed to the penalties</p><p>prescribed by the laws of that country.</p><p>Article 32</p><p>Nothing in this Convention shall prevent Contracting Parties which form a Customs or economic</p><p>union from enacting special provisions applic able to undertakings operating from the countries forming that</p><p>union.</p><p>Article 32 bis</p><p>This Convention shall not prevent the application of greater facilities which Contracting Parties grant</p><p>or may wish to grant, either by unilateral provisions or in virtue of bilateral or multilateral agreements, provided</p><p>that such facilities do not impede the application of the provisions of this Convention. The Contracting Parties</p><p>are recommended to waive the request for temporary importation papers and guarantees.</p><p>CHAPTER IX – FINAL PROVISIONS</p><p>Article 33</p><p>1. Countries members of the Economic Commission for Europe and countries admitted to the</p><p>Commission in a consultative capacity under paragraph 8 of the Commission’s Terms of Reference, may</p><p>become Contracting Parties to this Convention:</p><p>(a) by signing it;</p><p>(b) by ratifying it after signing it subject to ratification;</p><p>(c) by acceding to it.</p><p>2. Such countries as may participate in certain activities of the Economic Commission for Europe in</p><p>accordance with paragraph 11 of the Commission’s Terms of Reference may become Contracting Parties to</p><p>this Convention by acceding thereto after its entry into force.</p><p>2 bis. Any regional economic integration organization may become, in accordance with paragraph 1 of this</p><p>Article, a Contracting Party to this Convention.

For any country or regional economic integration organization ratifying or acceding to it after five</p><p>countries have signed it without reservation of ratification or have deposited their instrument of ratification</p><p>or accession, this Convention shall enter into force on the ninetieth day after the said country or regional</p><p>economic integration organization has deposited its instrument of ratification or accession.</p><p>Article 35</p><p>1. Any Contracting Party may denounce this Convention by so notifying the Secretary-General of the</p><p>United Nations.</p><p>2. Denunciation shall take effect fifteen months after the date of receipt by the Secretary-General of the</p><p>notification of denunciation.</p><p>3. The validity of temporary importation papers issued before the date when the denunciation takes effect</p><p>shall not be affected thereby and the guarantee of the association shall hold good. Extensions granted in</p><p>accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 21 of this Convention shall similarly remain valid.</p><p>Article 36</p><p>This Convention shall cease to have effect if, for any period of twelve consecutive months after its</p><p>entry into force, the number of Contracting Parties is less than five.</p><p>Article 37</p><p>1. Any country may, at the time of signing this Convention without reservation of ratification or of</p><p>depositing its instrument of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare by notification addressed</p><p>to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that this Convention shall extend to all or any of the territories</p><p>for the international relations of which it is responsible. The Convention shall extend to the territory or</p><p>territories named in the notification as from the ninetieth day after its receipt by the Secretary-General or, if</p><p>on that day the Convention has not yet entered into force, at the time of its entry into force.</p><p>2. Any country which has made a declaration under the preceding paragraph extending this Convention</p><p>to any territory for whose international relations it is responsible may denounce the Convention separately in</p><p>respect of that territory in accordance with the provisions of Article 35.</p><p><strong>-14-</strong></p><p>Article 38</p><p>1. Any dispute between two or more Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of</p><p>this Convention shall so far as possible be settled by negotiation between them.</p><p>2. Any dispute which is not settled by negotiation shall be submitted to arbitration if any one of the</p><p>Contracting Parties in dispute so requests and shall be referred accordingly to one or more arbitrators selected</p><p>by agreement between the Parties in dispute. If within three months from the date of the request for</p><p>arbitration the Parties in dispute are unable to agree on the selection of an arbitrator or arbitrators, any of those</p><p>Parties may request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to nominate a single arbitrator to whom the</p><p>dispute shall be referred for decision.</p><p>3.

No other reservation to this Convention shall be permitted.</p><p>Article 40</p><p>1. After this Convention has been in force for three years, any Contracting Party may, by notification</p><p>to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, request that a conference be convened for the purpose of</p><p>reviewing the Convention. The Secretary-General shall notify all Contracting Parties of the request and a</p><p>review conference shall be convened by the Secretary-General if, within a period of four months following</p><p>the date of notification by the Secretary-General, not less than one third of the Contracting Parties notify him</p><p>of their concurrence with the request.</p><p>2.

Not</p><p style="text-align: justify;">only does this treaty regulate the uses of the world’s largest resource,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">but it also contains a mandatory dispute settlement system — an</p><p style="text-align: justify;">unusual phenomenon in international law. While some scholars have</p><p style="text-align: justify;">lauded this development as a significant achievement, others have</p><p style="text-align: justify;">been highly skeptical of its comprehensiveness and effectiveness. This</p><p style="text-align: justify;">book explores whether a compulsory dispute settlement mechanism is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">necessary for the regulation of the oceans under the Convention. The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">requisite role of dispute settlement in the Convention is determined</p><p style="text-align: justify;">through an assessment of its relationship to the substantive</p><p style="text-align: justify;">provisions. Klein firstly describes the dispute settlement procedure in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the Convention. She then takes each of the issue areas subject to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">limitations or exceptions to compulsory procedures entailing binding</p><p style="text-align: justify;">decisions, and analyzes the inter-relationship between the substantive</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and procedural rules.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">natalie klein is a Lecturer at Macquarie University in Sydney,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Australia. She obtained her law degree from the University of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide, where she went on to teach international law. She</p><p style="text-align: justify;">completed her Doctorate at Yale Law School in 2003. Klein was</p><p style="text-align: justify;">recently an Associate at the New York office of Debevoise and Plimpton</p><p style="text-align: justify;">LLP, where she practiced in international litigation and arbitration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Klein has also worked as counsel to the Government of Eritrea on the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Eritrea/Yemen maritime boundary arbitration and the Eritrea/Ethiopia</p><p style="text-align: justify;">boundary dispute, and as a consultant in the Codification Division of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the Office of Legal Affairs at the United Nations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">© Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cambridge University Press</p><p style="text-align: justify;">0521835208 – Dispute Settlement in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Natalie Klein</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Frontmatter</p><p style="text-align: justify;">More information</p><p style="text-align: justify;">cambridge studies in international and comparative law</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Established in 1946, this series produces high quality scholarship in the fields</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of public and private international law and comparative law. Although these</p><p style="text-align: justify;">are distinct legal subdisciplines, developments since 1946 confirm their</p><p style="text-align: justify;">interrelation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Comparative law is increasingly used as a tool in the making of law at</p><p style="text-align: justify;">national, regional, and international levels. Private international law is now</p><p style="text-align: justify;">often affected by international conventions, and the issues faced by classical</p><p style="text-align: justify;">conflicts rules are frequently dealt with by substantive harmonisation of law</p><p style="text-align: justify;">under international auspices. Mixed international arbitrations, especially those</p><p style="text-align: justify;">involving state economic activity, raise mixed questions of public and private</p><p style="text-align: justify;">international law, while in many fields (such as the protection of human rights</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and democratic standards, investment guarantees and international criminal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">law) international and national systems interact. National constitutional</p><p style="text-align: justify;">arrangements relating to ‘foreign affairs,’ and to the implementation of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">international norms, are a focus of attention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Board welcomes works of a theoretical or interdisciplinary character,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and those focusing on the new approaches to international or comparative law</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or conflicts of law.

information</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Acknowledgements</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the inception of this work, I had the extreme good fortune of working</p><p style="text-align:

To me, she epitomizes what it means to be</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a teacher, scholar, and international lawyer. Professor Wedgwood always</p><p style="text-align: justify;">pushed me to think more critically and to take into account a political</p><p style="text-align: justify;">dynamic that I might well have otherwise overlooked. Most of all, Professors</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reisman, Brilmayer, and Wedgwood fundamentally changed my</p><p style="text-align: justify;">understanding of public international law and as a result, their instruction</p><p style="text-align: justify;">has greatly enriched my scholarship.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a student of international law at the University of Adelaide in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Australia, Professor Hilary Charlesworth, Dr. Judith Gardam, and Gerald</p><p style="text-align: justify;">McGinley first introduced me to the world of international law and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">opened up many possibilities for me. I am particularly grateful for the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ongoing support and advice of Dr. Gardam.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This book is based on my dissertation prepared in fulfillment of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">requirements for the Doctor of the Science of Law at Yale Law School.

Holtzmann Fellowship in International Arbitration and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a Lillian Goldman Fellowship. Many people at Yale Law School provided</p><p style="text-align: justify;">assistance to me in a myriad of ways, resolving a range of administrative,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">technical and financial issues, and in this regard, I would like to thank</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Judy Couture, Associate Dean Barbara Safriet, Judith Miller, John Davie,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cina Santos, Paddy Spiegelhalter, Marge Camera, and Yvonne Squeri.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">viii</p><p style="text-align: justify;">© Cambridge University Press www.cambridge.org</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cambridge University Press</p><p style="text-align: justify;">0521835208 – Dispute Settlement in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Natalie Klein</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Frontmatter</p><p style="text-align: justify;">More information</p><p style="text-align: justify;">acknowledgements ix</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The transformation from dissertation to book was completed during</p><p style="text-align: justify;">my time as an associate at Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, and I am grateful</p><p style="text-align: justify;">for the support of Donald Francis Donovan throughout this undertaking.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">My thanks also to Lorraine Cali for her assistance during the final editing</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of the text.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Essential to me throughout this undertaking, and all leading up to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">it, are those who have provided indispensable moral support.

This device is made up of two decks separated by bearers, or of a single</p><p style="text-align: justify;">deck supported by feet; its overall height is reduced to the minimum compatible with handling by fork lift</p><p style="text-align: justify;">trucks and pallet trucks; it may or may not have a superstructure;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) the term “persons” shall mean both natural and legal persons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. The present Convention shall apply to pallets imported into the territory of a Contracting Party from</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the territory of another Contracting Party.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 2</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Each Contracting Party shall grant admission, without payment of import duties and import taxes,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and free of import prohibitions or restrictions, to pallets on condition</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) that they have been previously exported or that they will be subsequently re-exported, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) that an equal number of pallets of the same type and substantially the same value have been</p><p style="text-align: justify;">previously exported or will be subsequently exported.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Subject to the provisions of article 3 of the present Convention, the procedure for the admission of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">pallets as provided for in paragraph 1 of this article shall be determined by the regulations of each of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Contracting Parties. These regulations, in particular, may include provisions for preventing the permanent</p><p style="text-align: justify;">importation, free of import duties and import taxes, of a number of pallets greater than the number exported</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or to be exported.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to make the formalities as simple as possible and in particular</p><p style="text-align: justify;">not to require a security in respect of import duties and import taxes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 3</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Each Contracting Party shall apply the provisions of article 2, paragraph 1, of the present Convention,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">without requiring in respect of importation or exportation either the production of a Customs document or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">security in respect of import duties and import taxes, to pallets pooled under an agreement by which the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">parties thereto:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) exchange among themselves, from country to country, pallets of one and the same type in the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">course of operations involving the international transport of goods,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) keep accounts, for each type of pallet, showing the number of pallets so exchanged from</p><p style="text-align: justify;">country to country, and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) undertake to deliver to one another within a specified period the number of pallets of each</p><p style="text-align: justify;">type necessary to offset at regular intervals, on a bilateral or multilateral basis, the outstanding balances of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the accounts so kept.2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall be applicable only if:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) pallets bear a marking conforming to that laid down in the pooling agreement;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) the pooling agreement has been communicated to the Customs administrations of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Contracting Parties concerned and these administrations have approved it, being satisfied that the types of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">pallet are sufficiently well defined and that the due and proper implementation of the agreement is adequately</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ensured.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Article 4</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the Contracting Parties reserves the right to levy the internal duties and taxes and the import</p><p style="text-align: justify;">duties and import taxes, if any, chargeable in its country in respect of pallets purchased, or subject to a similar</p><p style="text-align: justify;">contract entered into by persons resident or established in its territory.

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><strong>ADVISORY SERVICE</strong> ON INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW ____________________________________ <strong>1954 Convention on the</strong> <strong>Protection of Cultural Property</strong> <strong>in the Event of Armed Conflict</strong> <strong>and its Protocols</strong> Military operations have often resulted in the destruction of irreplaceable cultural property, a loss not only to the country of origin but also to the cultural heritage of all people. Recognizing the significance of this loss, the international community adopted the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (CCP). A Protocol dealing with cultural property during times of occupation (P1) was adopted at the same time as the 1954 Convention. Although the 1954 Convention strengthens protection for cultural property, its provisions have not been implemented consistently. To address thisproblem, a second Protocol to the 1954 Convention (P2) was adopted on 26 March 1999. In addition to these instruments, the 1977 Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions include provisions protecting cultural property (Protocol I, Art. 38, 53 and 85, and Protocol II, Art. 16). Ratification of each of the above-mentioned instruments is essential to preserving objects precious to all humanity. <strong>Cultural Property</strong> Cultural property is any movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of all people, such as monuments of architecture or history, archaeological sites, works of art, books or any building whose main and effectivepurpose is to contain cultural property (CCP, Art. 1). <strong>Identification</strong> Cultural property should be identified with the emblem of the 1954 Convention, pictured above (CCP, Art. 16, 17). <strong>Systems of Protection</strong> Parties to the Convention must protect all cultural property, whether their own or that situated in the territory of other States Parties. The various systems that provide protection for cultural property are described below: <strong><em>General Protection</em></strong> <em>All </em>cultural property must be afforded, at minimum, “general protection”, as described in the Convention. <em>Protection:</em> Parties to the Convention must safeguard their own cultural property against foreseeable effects of armed conflict (CCP, Art. 3). _ States Parties must also respect all cultural property by the following: (1) not using cultural property for any purpose likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; (2) not directing any act of hostility against cultural property (CCP, Art. 4). <em>Exception</em>: _ The obligation to respect a l l cultural property, described above, may be waived on the basis of “imperative military necessity” (CCP, Art. 4). _ This waiver may be invoked: (1) to <em>use </em>cultural property for purposes likely to endanger it, only if there is no feasible alternative available to obtain a similar military advantage. (P2, Art. 6); (2) to <em>attack </em>cultural property, only when that property has, by its function, been made into a military objective and there is no feasible alternative available to obtain a similar military advantage. Effective advance warning must be given, circumstances permitting (P2, Art. 6). <em>Precautions:</em> _ Parties to the Convention must, to the maximum extent feasible, either move cultural property away from military objectives or avoid placing military objectives near such property (P2, Art. 8). _ Parties to a conflict must do everything feasible to protect cultural property, including refraining from an attack that may cause incidental damage (P2, Art. 7). International Committee of the Red Cross <em>Occupied Territory</em> _ Under the Convention, States Parties occupying foreign territory must preserve cultural property in that territory (CCP, Art. 5). _ The 1954 Protocol requires States Parties occupying territory during armed conflict to prevent the exportation of cultural property from that territory (P1, Art. 1). However, if cultural property is exported, States Parties must return it atthe close of the hostilities (P1,Art. 3). <strong><em>Special protection</em></strong> The 1954 Convention provides a system of “special protection”, which resulted in only limited success. In response to the limitations of the 1954 system, the 1999 Protocol introduces a new system of <em>“</em>enhanced protection” <em>(see below</em>). If property has been granted both special and enhanced protection, only enhanced protection applies (P2, Art. 4). <strong><em>Enhanced protection</em></strong> The 1999 Protocol provides “enhanced protection” of certain cultural objects. <em>Criteria for Protection:</em> _ To be granted “enhanced protection”, cultural property must meet the following three criteria (P2, Art. 10): (1) it is cultural heritage of the greatest importance to humanity; (2) it is protected by domestic measures that recognize its cultural and historical value and ensure the highestlevel of protection; (3) it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites, and the Party which has control over the property has formally declared that it will not be so used. _ Cultural property granted enhanced protection by the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict is placed on the “List of Cultural Property under Enhanced Protection” (P2, Art.11). <em>Protection:</em> _ Parties holding property included on the List must not <em>use </em>such property or its immediate surroundings in support of military action (P2, Art. 12). There is no exception to this obligation. _ Parties to the Convention must refrain from <em>attack </em>against property on the List (P2, Art.12). <em>Exception:</em> _ The obligation not to <em>attack </em>property on the List does not apply if such property has, by virtue of its use, become a military objective. Attack is permitted only if it is the only feasible means of terminating such use and if precautions are taken to minimize damage to the property. Effective advance warning must be given, circumstances permitting (P2,Art. 13). <strong>Criminal Responsibility and Jurisdiction</strong> Parties to the Convention must take all necessary steps to prosecute and impose sanctions on all persons who violate its provisions (CCP, Art.28). States party to the 1999 Protocol must ensure that the following are offences under domestic law (P2,Art. 15): (1) making cultural property under enhanced protection the object of attack; (2) using cultural property underenhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in support of military action; (3) extensive destruction or appropriation of protected cultural property; (4) making protected cultural property the object of attack; ( 5) theft, pillage or misappropriation of, or acts of vandalism directed against, protected cultural property. Each State Party must ensure that its legislation establishes jurisdiction when the offence is committed in its territory, when the alleged offender is a national of that State, and — in relation to the first three offences — when the offence is committed abroad by a non-national. <strong>Dissemination</strong> Parties to the 1954 Convention and its Protocols must disseminate the treaty provisions as widely as possible, seeking to strengthen appreciation and respect for cultural property among the general population (CCP, Art. 25; P2, Art. 30). Particular effort should be taken to disseminate information among the armed forces and personnel engaged in the protection of cultural property. <em>09/2002</em> International Committee of the Red Cross</p></div></div>

The first Hague Convention on divorce and separation, adopted on 12 June 1902, dealt with conflicts of law and jurisdiction in this field. However, more than half a century later, the 1902 Convention proved less and less adapted to prevailing circumstances and the Member States of the Hague Conference found it necessary to draw up a new Convention. The <em>Hague</em><em> Convention on Recognition of Divorce and Legal Separations </em>was concluded on 1 June 1970 and entered into force on 24 August 1975.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Objectives </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The <em>1970 Hague Recognition of Divorce Convention </em>aims to facilitate the recognition in one Contracting State of divorces and legal separations obtained in another Contracting State<sup>1 </sup>and thus assure divorced and separated spouses that that their new status shall receive the same recognition abroad as in the country where the divorce or separation is obtained.<sup>2 </sup>The Convention thereby simplifies the possibility of remarriage and clarifies the legal relationship of the couple concerned, a factor which can prove very important for the dependent children of a new relationship. The Convention furthermore envisages combating “forum shopping” in the field of divorce.<sup>3 </sup></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scope </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention applies to the recognition of divorces and legal separations which follow judicial or other proceedings officially recognised in a Contracting State and which are legally effective there.<sup>4 </sup>The Convention covers not only decrees granted by a court but also divorces or legal separations resulting from legislative, administrative or religious acts.<sup>5 </sup>The Convention only applies to the decree of divorce or legal separation, not to findings of fault or to ancillary orders pronounced on the making of the decree of divorce or legal separation.<sup>6 </sup>Furthermore, the annulment of marriages does not fall within the scope of the Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention deals with the recognition of the described divorces and legal separations only; whether or not their enforcement requires proceedings, and if so, of what kind, is left to the States concerned to decide.<sup>7 </sup></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention applies regardless of the date on which the divorce of legal separation was obtained.<sup>8 </sup></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>1 </sup>See Preamble and Article 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>2 </sup>See Explanatory Report by P. Bellet and B. Goldman.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>3 </sup><em>Ibid</em>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>4 </sup>Article 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>5 </sup>See Explanatory Report.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>6 </sup>See Article 1 and Explanatory Report.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>7 </sup>See Explanatory Report.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>8 </sup>Article 24.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>9 </sup>Article 2 (1).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>10 </sup>Article 2 (2).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>11 </sup>Article 2 (3), (4).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>12 </sup>Article 2 (5).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>13 </sup>See Explanatory Report.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>14 </sup>Article 3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>15 </sup>Article 7.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>16 </sup>Article 8.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>17 </sup>Article 9.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>18 </sup>Article 19 (1).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">How the Convention pursues its objectives</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention does not establish direct uniform rules of jurisdiction in the Contracting States. It regulates jurisdiction indirectly, by providing that recognition of divorces or legal separations is conditional upon presence of certain links between the spouses, or either one of them, and the State of divorce or legal separation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Divorces and legal separations to be recognised</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Convention provides for recognition of divorces or legal separations obtained in a Contracting State if, at the date the proceedings were instituted, the respondent had his or her habitual residence there,<sup>9 </sup>or the petitioner had his or her habitual residence there. For the latter case, an additional condition is that either the petitioner’s habitual residence existed for more than one year or the spouses last habitually resided there together.<sup>10 </sup>Recognition of divorce or legal separation is furthermore provided for cases where both spouses were nationals of the State of origin or the petitioner was a national of that State, provided that the petitioner had his habitual residence there or he had habitually resided there for a continuous period of, at least one year, within the two year preceding the institution of the proceedings.<sup>11 </sup>Finally, a divorce is to be recognised where the petitioner was a national of that State and he was present there at the time of institution of the proceedings, provided that the spouses last habitually resided together in a State whose law, at the date of the institution of the proceedings, did not provide for divorce.<sup>12 </sup>The latter rule only applies to divorces and cannot be extended to legal separations by analogy.<sup>13 </sup></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expression “habitual residence” is to be deemed to include the term domicile, where the State of origin of a divorce or legal separation uses the concept of domicile as a test of jurisdiction in matters of divorce or legal separation.<sup>14 </sup></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Refusal of recognition</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The recognition of a divorce or legal separation may be refused where: (1) both parties were nationals of States which did not provide for divorce and of no other State;<sup>15 </sup>(2) adequate steps were not taken to give notice of the proceedings to the respondent;<sup>16 </sup>and, (3) the divorce or legal separation is incompatible with a previous decision determining the matrimonial status of the spouses, provided that the decision is in effect or recognisable in the State where recognition of the divorce or legal separation is sought.<sup>17 </sup>Furthermore, a Contracting State may refuse recognition where such recognition is manifestly incompatible with its public policy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reservations</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Contracting States may at the time of ratification or accession reserve the right to refuse recognition in the following circumstances: where the spouses at the time of divorce or legal separation were nationals only of the State in which recognition is sought and the law applicable according to the private international law of that State would have led to a different result then the law applied by the State of origin;<sup>18 </sup>and, where the spouses at the relevant</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">September 2008 Page 2 of 3  September 2008 Page 3 of 3</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>19 </sup>Article 19 (2); Contracting States who make a reservation according to Article 19 (2) may not refuse recognition by the application of Article 7.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>20 </sup>Articles 20 and 21.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>21 </sup>Article 26.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>22 </sup>Article 28 (1).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>23 </sup>Article 28 (4).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">time both habitually resided in States which did not provide for divorce.<sup>19 </sup>Further reservations are possible for States whose laws do not provide respectively for divorce or legal separation.<sup>20 </sup></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convention Status</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The 1970 Hague Recognition of Divorce Convention has currently 18 Contracting States.

Background</p><p>1. The formal mandate for negotiations on a new Convention on the international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance is to be found in the decision taken by the States represented at the Nineteenth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. According to this mandate, the Session:</p><p>“a) Decides to include in the Agenda for the Twentieth Session the preparation of a new comprehensive convention on maintenance obligation which would build on the best features of the existing Hague Conventions on this matter and include rules on judicial and administrative co-operation, and requests the Secretary General to continue the preliminary work and to convene a Special Commission for this purpose.</p><p>b) Considers to be desirable the participation of non-Member States of the Conference, in particular signatory States to the New York Convention of 20 June 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance, and requests that the Secretary General make his best efforts to obtain their participation in this work, and ensure that the processes involved are inclusive, including by the provision, if possible, of Spanish translation of key documents and facilities for Spanish interpretation at plenary meetings”.1</p><p>2. A Special Commission meeting was held in April 1999 to examine the practical operation of the four existing Hague Conventions (the Hague Convention of 24 October 1956 on the law applicable to maintenance obligations towards children (hereinafter “1956 Hague Maintenance Convention”2); the Hague Convention of 15 April 1958 concerning the recognition and enforcement of decisions relating to maintenance obligations towards children (hereinafter “1958 Hague Maintenance Convention”3); the Hague Convention of 2 October 1973 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions relating to Maintenance Obligations (hereinafter “1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Enforcement)”4); and the Hague Convention of 2 October 1973 on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations (hereinafter “1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Applicable Law)”5) as well as the New York Convention of 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance (hereinafter “1956 New York Convention”6).7 A variety of problems were identified ranging from, on the one hand, a complete failure by certain States to fulfil their Convention obligations, particularly under the 1956 New York Convention, to, on the other hand, differences in interpretation and practice under the various Conventions. These differences related to such matters as the establishment of paternity, locating the defendant, approaches to the grant of legal aid and the payment of costs, the status of public authorities and of maintenance debtors under the 1956 New York Convention, enforcement of index-linked judgments, the question of the cumulative application of the Conventions and detailed matters such as mechanisms for transferring funds across international frontiers.</p><p>3. There was clearly disappointment at the 1999 Special Commission meeting that many of the problems identified appeared to have remained unresolved despite the attention that had already been drawn to them by the previous Special Commission of 1995. That earlier Special Commission had taken the view that there was no need to consider major reforms of the relevant Conventions. The emphasis was placed on</p><p><sup>1 </sup>Final Act of the Nineteenth Session, 2002, shortly to be published in Proceedings of the Nineteenth Session, Tome I, Miscellaneous Matters.</p><p><sup>2 </sup>See list of abbreviations under para. 13 of this Report.</p><p><sup>3 </sup>Ibid.</p><p><sup>4 </sup>Ibid.</p><p><sup>5 </sup>Ibid.</p><p><sup>6 </sup>Ibid.</p><p><sup>7 </sup>See “Report on and Conclusions of the Special Commission on Maintenance Obligations of April 1999”, drawn up by the Permanent Bureau, December 1999, and W. Duncan, “Note on the Desirability of Revising the Hague Conventions on Maintenance Obligations and including in a New Instrument Rules on Judicial and Administrative Co-operation”, Prel. Doc. No 2 of January 1999 for the attention of the Special Commission (hereinafter Prel. Doc. No 2/1999).</p><p>4</p><p>improving practice under the existing Conventions.8 This approach was advocated again during the 1999 Special Commission. There was a natural reluctance among delegates to consider further international instruments in an area in which so many instruments already exist. Apart from the four Hague Conventions and the 1956 New York Convention, there are various regional conventions and arrangements, including the Brussels Convention, the Brussels Regulation, the Lugano Convention, the Montevideo Convention and the system that operates among Commonwealth countries, as well as a proliferation of bilateral treaties and less formal agreements.</p><p>4. Despite this natural reluctance, the Special Commission of 1999 in the end came down in favour of a radical approach, namely that the Hague Conference should commence work on the elaboration of a new worldwide instrument. The reasons for this conclusion may be summarised as follows:</p><p><sup>8 </sup>See “General Conclusions of the Special Commission of November 1995 on the operation of the Hague Conventions Relating to Maintenance Obligations and of the New York Convention of 20 June 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance”, drawn up by the Permanent Bureau, Prel. Doc. No 10 of May 1996 for the attention of the Eighteenth Session (hereinafter Prel. Doc. No 10/1996).</p><p>– disquiet at the chronic nature of many of the problems associated with some of the existing Conventions;</p><p>– a perception that the number of cases being processed through the international machinery was very small in comparison with real needs;</p><p>– a growing acceptance that the 1956 New York Convention, though an important advance in its day, had become somewhat obsolete, that the open texture of some of its provisions was contributing to inconsistent interpretation and practice, and that its operation had not been effectively monitored;</p><p>– an acceptance of the need to take account of the many changes that have occurred in national (especially child support) systems for determining and collecting maintenance payments, as well as the opportunities presented by advances in information technology;</p><p>– a realisation that the proliferation of instruments (multilateral, regional and bilateral), with their varying provisions and different degrees of formality, were complicating the tasks of national authorities, as well as legal advisers.</p><p>5. The recommendation to begin work on a new worldwide international instrument adopted by the 1999 Special Commission included the following directions:</p><p>“The new instrument should:</p><p>– contain as an essential element provisions relating to administrative co-operation,</p><p>– be comprehensive in nature, building upon the best features of the existing Conventions, including in particular those concerning the recognition and enforcement of maintenance obligations,</p><p>– take account of future needs, the developments occurring in national and international systems of maintenance recovery and the opportunities provided by advances in information technology,</p><p>– be structured to combine the maximum efficiency with the flexibility necessary to achieve widespread ratification.”</p><p>6. In carrying out the Decision of the Nineteenth Diplomatic Session, the Secretary General convened a Special Commission which met at The Hague from 5 to 16 May 2003, from 7 to 18 June 2004, from 4 to 15 April 2005, from 19 to 28  June 2006 and from 8 to 16 May 2007. This Special Commission authorised the drawing up of a preliminary draft Convention, which, accompanied by the present Report, will serve as a basis for the discussions at the Conference’s Twenty-First Session which is to take place at The Hague from 5-23 November 2007. [add reference to States invited]</p><p>5</p><p><sup>9 </sup>This Committee was made up, in addition to its chairman, by the reporters, as members ex officio and the members of the Permanent Bureau, as well as the following experts: Ms Denise Gervais (Canada), Mary Helen Carlson (United States of America), Namira Negm (Egypt), Mária Kurucz (Hungary), Stefania Bariatti (Italy), María Elena Mansilla y Mejía (Mexico), Katja Lenzing (European Commission) and Cecilia Fresnado de Aguirre (Inter-American Children’s Initiative) and Messrs Jin Sun (China), Lixiao Tian (China), Robert Keith (United States of America), Jérôme Déroulez (France) Edouard de Leiris (France), Paul Beaumont (United Kingdom), Antoine Buchet (European Commission) and Miloš Ha?apka (European Commission).</p><p><sup>10 </sup>A full list of the preliminary documents is set out in Annex 1.

No 3 of April 2003 drawn up for the attention of the Special Commission of May 2003 (hereinafter Prel. Doc. No 3/2003).</p><p><sup>11 </sup>See footnote 6.</p><p><sup>12 </sup>In the Special Commission of June 2004 Chile, Argentina and Mexico asked for the incorporation of Spanish as language of the Convention. For Chile, language could be an inconvenience for the exercise of access to justice, which is a human right.</p><p><sup>13 </sup>“Revised preliminary draft Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance”, Prel. Doc. No 29 of June 2007 drawn up for the attention of the Twenty-First Session of November 2007.</p><p>7. Mr Fausto Pocar, expert from Italy, was elected as Chairman of the Special Commission and Ms Mária Kurucz, expert from Hungary, Mrs Mary Helen Carlson, expert from the United States, and Mr Jin Sun, expert from China, were elected as vice-Chairs. Mrs Alegría Borrás, expert from Spain, and Ms Jennifer Degeling, expert from Australia, were elected as Reporters. A Drafting Committee was constituted under the chairmanship of Mrs Jan M. Doogue,9 expert from New Zealand. The work of the Special Commissions and of the Drafting Committee was greatly facilitated by the substantial preliminary documents10 and remarks of Mr William Duncan, Deputy Secretary General, who was responsible for the scientific work of the Secretariat.</p><p>8. According to the mandate given by the Special Commission, the Drafting Committee not only met during the Special Commission, but also met from 27 to 30 October 2003, from 12 to 16  January 2004, from 19 to 22 October 2004, from 5 to 9 September 2005, 11 to 15 February 2006 and from 16 to 18 May 2007. Also two meetings by conference calls took place on 28 November and 7 December 2006.</p><p>9. A Working Group on applicable law, chaired by Andrea Bonomi (Switzerland) and a Working Group on Administrative Co-operation, convened by Mrs Mary Helen Carlson (United States of   America), Ms Mária Kurucz (Hungary) and Mr Jorge Aguilar Castillo (Costa Rica) met several times in person and through conference calls. Also, a Committee on Forms, co-ordinated by the Permanent Bureau, worked in close co-operation with the Working Group on Administrative Co-operation and some meetings and conference calls took place.</p><p>10. The Conference’s Twenty-First Diplomatic Session entrusted the drafting of the Convention to its second Commission which held ……… sittings. Participating in the negotiations, in addition to the delegates of the sixty-six Members of the Conference represented at the Twenty-First Session, observers from …….. other States as well as from …… intergovernmental organisations and ……. non-governmental organisations also took part.</p><p>11. It has to be remembered that, for this Convention, it is the first time that, in the final act of the Diplomatic Session11 in which the agreement to start the drafting of the Convention was adopted, Spanish is mentioned. Notwithstanding, this does not mean a new position for Spanish in the Hague Conference.12</p><p>12. This report deals with the preliminary draft Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance which was drawn up by the Drafting Committee under the authority of the Special Commission on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance for the attention of the Twenty-First Session of November 2007.13</p><p>II. Abbreviations and references</p><p>13. To facilitate and simplify the reference to the different Conventions and instruments throughout this Report, the following abbreviations are used. A short description of the Convention is also included.</p><p>6</p><p><sup>14 </sup>See footnote 10.</p><p><sup>15 </sup>Lagarde Report (children), para. 31.</p><p>– 1956 New York Convention – New York Convention of 20 June 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance. It is the first Convention in which a system of co-operation of authorities is established. It is not a Convention on enforcement and it can be applied in combination with the 1958 Hague Maintenance Convention or with the 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Enforcement) (see Annex 1 of Prel. Doc. No 3/200314).</p><p>– UN Convention on the Rights of the Child – New York Convention of 20 November 1989 on the Rights of the Child. Article 2 of the Convention establishes that the parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind. Article 27 refers specifically to maintenance obligations.</p><p>– 1956 Hague Maintenance Convention – Hague Convention of 24  October 1956 on the law applicable to maintenance obligations towards children. A great majority of States Party in this Convention are also Parties in the 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Applicable Law).</p><p>– 1958 Hague Maintenance Convention – Hague Convention of 15 April 1958 concerning the recognition and enforcement of decisions relating to maintenance obligations towards children. A great majority of States party in this Convention are also parties in the 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Enforcement).– 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Applicable Law) – Hague Convention of 2 October 1973 on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations. According to Article 1, the Convention applies “to maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity, including a maintenance obligation in respect of a child who is not legitimate”. The law designated by the Convention (Art. 3) “shall apply irrespective of any requirement of reciprocity and whether or not it is the law of a Contracting State”.</p><p>– 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Enforcement) – Hague Convention of 2  October 1973 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations. Article 1 of the Convention defines the scope of application as does the Hague Convention of the same date on applicable law. The advantage of having two Conventions and not only one is that some States can be Contracting States for one of them and not for the other.</p><p>– Verwilghen Report – Explanatory Report on the 1973 Hague Maintenance Conventions, by Michel Verwilghen (1975).</p><p>– 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention – Hague Convention of 25  October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The experience from the operation of the provisions of this Convention concerning administrative co-operation and the functions of Central Authorities provided a basis on which similar provisions were developed in the new Convention.</p><p>– 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention – Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. As with the 1980 Convention, the experience from the operation of the provisions of this Convention concerning administrative co-operation and the functions of Central Authorities provided a basis on which similar provisions were developed in the new Convention.</p><p>– 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention – Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. Article 4, sub-paragraph e) excludes “maintenance obligations” from the scope of application of the Convention, an exclusion that is considered as necessary, taking into account the existence of other Hague Conventions and the existing rules in Brussels and Lugano Conventions.15</p><p>7</p><p><sup>16 </sup>Lagarde Report (adults), para. 32.</p><p>– Lagarde Report (children) – Explanatory Report on the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention by Paul Lagarde (1998).</p><p>– 2000 Hague Adults Convention – Hague Convention of 13 January 2000 on the International Protection of Adults. Article 4, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph a) excludes “maintenance obligations” from the scope of the Convention, for the same reasons as the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention.16</p><p>– Lagarde Report (adults) – Explanatory Report on the 2000 Hague Adults Convention (2003).</p><p>– 2005 Hague Choice of Court Convention – Hague Convention of 30 June  2005 on Choice of Court Agreements.</p><p>– Brussels Convention – Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters. It was opened for signature in Brussels, Belgium, on 27 September 1968. The original Parties were the six original Member States of what was the European Economic  Community. As new States have joined the European Union, as it is now called, they have become Parties to the Brussels Convention. It now applies only between the fourteen old European Union Member States and the Netherlands Antilles and French overseas territories. Maintenance obligations are included in the Convention and the Convention includes a special rule on jurisdiction (Art. 5, para. 2).</p><p>– Lugano Convention – Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters. It was opened for signature in Lugano, Switzerland, on 16 September 1988. It contains similar provisions to the Brussels Convention (it is also called the “Parallel” Convention). The Contracting States to the Lugano Convention are the 15 “old” European Union Member States and Iceland, Norway, Poland and Switzerland. The demarcation between the Brussels and Lugano Conventions is laid down in Article 54 B of the Lugano Convention. It is based on the principle that the Lugano Convention will not apply to relations among the European Union Member States, but will apply where one of the other countries mentioned above is involved. As in the Brussels Convention, maintenance obligations are included in the Lugano Convention. A new revised Lugano Convention will be concluded shortly. The text, as adopted in March 2007, maintains the same rule on maintenance obligations as the Convention of 1988.</p><p>– Brussels I Regulation – Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters. It applies among all the European Union except Denmark and replaces the Brussels Convention in the mutual relations between those States to which it applies. The Regulation includes the same rule as in the Brussels Convention. An agreement between the European Community and Denmark has been concluded to apply the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation to the relations of the European Community with Denmark on 19 October 2005, that entered into force on 1 July 2007.</p><p>– Brussels II bis Regulation – Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 on proceedings relating to divorce, legal separation and marriage annulment and those relating to parental responsibility over the children of both spouses on the occasion of matrimonial proceedings.</p><p>– EEO Regulation – Regulation 805/2004 creates a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims, which means (Art. 5) that a judgment which has been certified as a European Enforcement Order in the Member State of origin shall be recognized and enforced in the other Member States without the need for a declaration of enforceability and without any possibility of opposing its recognition. The Regulation, just as the Brussels Regulation, also includes maintenance.</p><p>8</p><p><sup>17 </sup>See footnote 10.</p><p><sup>18 </sup>See footnote 13.</p><p><sup>19 </sup>Without prejudice of the fact that the progressive aging of the population may give rise to a change in those terms.</p><p><sup>20 </sup>The Conventions and the Explanatory Report of Michael Verwilghen, Actes et documents de la Douzième session (1972), Tome IV, Obligations alimentaires.

Such bilateral agreements are negotiated between these jurisdictions and sometimes with third States such as Austria, Germany, Norway or the states of the United States.</p><p>– Montevideo Convention – Inter-American Convention on support obligations, adopted in Montevideo, on 15 July 1989. The States Parties in the Convention are Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Uruguay (see Annex 2 of Prel. Doc. No 3/2003).17</p><p>– “The Convention” – This refers to the text of the revised preliminary draft Convention (in Prel. Doc. No 2918), officially known as the preliminary draft Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance.</p><p>III. General framework</p><p>14. The protection of children is one of the main concerns in international co-operation in general and in the Hague Conference on Private International Law in particular. And, in this context, maintenance is a fundamental element. It is true that problems of maintenance obligations can arise from other family relationships, parentage, marriage or affinity. But a great majority of claims related to maintenance obligations involve children.19 In the period which followed the end of the Second World War three Conventions were concluded on maintenance obligations. Firstly, the 1956 New York Convention. Secondly, in the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the 1956 Hague Maintenance Convention and the 1958 Hague Maintenance Convention. And those Conventions were renewed and broadened by the 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Enforcement) and the 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Applicable Law).20</p><p>15. It is worth underlining how the Hague Conference, in recent times, has successfully adopted several Conventions on the protection of children and adults, which include notably modern rules on the co-operation of authorities and of the recognition and enforcement of decisions. These Conventions are the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (hereinafter “the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention”21), the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (hereinafter “the 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention”22), the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (hereinafter “the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention”23) and the Hague Convention 13 January 2000 on the International Protection of Adults (hereinafter “the 2000 Hague Adults Convention”24). In the meantime, the New York Convention of 1989 on the Rights of the</p><p>9</p><p><sup>25 </sup>Ibid.</p><p><sup>26 </sup>In force in 193 States (as of 19 April 2007).</p><p>Child (hereinafter “the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child”25) also entered into force in a large number of States in the world. The current Convention on maintenance is in harmony with the principles in all of these Conventions and can be considered as a significant further step in the protection of children and adults.</p><p>IV. General layout of the preliminary draft Convention</p><p>16. The title of the preliminary draft Convention – Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance – stresses the main objective of the Convention: to ensure that maintenance obligations are respected even though the creditor and debtor may be in different countries. And, to that end, child support is mentioned in the first place but, in the second place, other forms of family maintenance are also envisaged. In contrast to other Hague Conventions, in particular the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention, the techniques which are envisaged (such as recognition and enforcement, co-operation) are not mentioned in the title. Besides being a more elegant title, it has the advantage of simplicity and of being distinct from the title of other Conventions on maintenance obligations.</p><p>17. The Preamble explains the main concerns and the thinking underlying the preparation of the Convention. A special mention is made of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.26 According to Article 2 of that Convention, the parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind. And the Preamble of the preliminary draft Convention specially mentions Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which establishes that the best interest of the child shall be a primary consideration, and Article 27, which states the following:</p><p>“1. States Parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.</p><p>2. The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities and financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child’s development.</p><p>3. States Parties, in accordance with national conditions and within their means, shall take appropriate measures to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right and shall in case of need provide material assistance and support programmes, particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing.</p><p>4. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to secure the recovery of maintenance for the child from the parents or other persons having financial responsibility for the child, both within the State Party and from abroad. In particular, where the person having financial responsibility for the child lives in a State different from that of the child, States Parties shall promote the accession to international agreements or the conclusion of such agreements, as well as the making of other appropriate arrangements”.</p><p>18. The Convention is divided into nine Chapters: Scope and definitions; Administrative co-operation; Applications through Central Authorities; Recognition and Enforcement; Enforcement by the requested State; Public bodies; General provisions; Final clauses.</p><p>19. Chapter I of the Convention (Scope and definitions) includes, firstly, the objects of the Convention. Secondly, Article 2 sets out the material scope of the Convention, discussed at length during the preparation of the Convention. Finally, Article 3 provides some definitions.</p><p>20. Chapter II (Administrative co-operation) contains provisions concerning Central Authorities, in particular, their designation, functions and costs. It also provides for requests for specific measures of assistance which are not applications.</p><p>10</p><p><sup>27 </sup>A summary of these discussions can be read in “Report on the First meeting of the Special Commission on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance (5-16 May 2003)”, Prel. Doc. No 5 of October 2003, drawn up by the Permanent Bureau, pp. 27-29, paras 86-89 (hereinafter Prel. Doc. No 5/2003).</p><p><sup>28 </sup>The discussion took place in the context of the description found in the Report, Prel. Doc. No 3/2003 (supra footnote 10), pp. 44-54, paras 103-134.</p><p>21. Chapter III (Applications through Central Authorities) specifies the types of applications which must be available under the Convention. It also describes the required contents of the applications and the procedures to follow for the transmission, receipt and processing of applications. In addition, Chapter III contains key provisions which are intended to guarantee effective access to procedures under the Convention.</p><p>22. Chapter IV includes only one article, Article 15, related to the limit on proceedings.</p><p>23. Chapter V (Recognition and enforcement) deals with the recognition and enforcement of decisions, which means the intermediate formalities to which recognition and enforcement of a foreign decision are subject before enforcement stricto sensu, which is the subject of Chapter VI (Enforcement by the requested State). Chapter VII (Public bodies) clarifies that for the purpose of recognition and enforcement under Article 10(1), “creditor” includes a public body in certain circumstances.</p><p>24. Chapter VIII contains the general provisions, while Chapter IX contains the final provisions.</p><p>V. Direct rules of jurisdiction</p><p>25. The subject of direct rules of jurisdiction was discussed from the beginning of the negotiations27 and took place at different moments thereafter. The discussions focussed on the questions of whether the inclusion of uniform rules would bring real and practical benefits to the international system, and whether it was realistic to expect that negotiations on the subject would produce agreement or consensus.28 There are two important areas of divergence in relation to current approaches to jurisdiction. First, in the case of jurisdiction to make original maintenance decisions, there is the divergence between on the one hand those systems which accepted creditor’s residence / domicile without more as a basis for exercising jurisdiction (typified by the Brussels / Lugano and Montevideo regimes), and on the other hand systems which insist upon some minimum nexus between the authority exercising jurisdiction and the debtor (typified by the system operating within the United States). Second, as described under Article 15, in the case of jurisdiction to modify an existing maintenance decision, there is the divergence between systems that adopt the general concept of “continuing jurisdiction” in the State where the original decision was made (see the United States model), and those which on the other hand accept that jurisdiction to modify an existing order may shift to the courts or authorities of another State, in particular one in which the creditor has established a new residence or domicile (see the regional systems mentioned above).</p><p>26. The experts considered a number of options, including the following:</p><p>a) That the attempt should be made to identify a common core of jurisdictional grounds on which there might be widespread agreement, beginning for example with defendant’s forum and submission to the jurisdiction, and then adding a creditor’s forum but subject to limitations necessary to satisfy the “due process” concerns of certain States.</p><p>b) That a common core of rules might be identified, including creditor’s forum, on the basis that this principle is widely accepted, but this might be combined with some kind of opt-out provision for States unable to accept a pure creditor’s forum.</p><p>c) That the search for uniform principles should be set aside, and concentration should be placed on developing an effective system of co-operation combined with indirect rules of jurisdiction for the purposes of recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions or orders.</p><p>27. At the end of the first meeting of the Special Commission, further to a proposal supported by several experts, an informal working group on direct jurisdiction was</p><p>11</p><p><sup>29 </sup>Co-ordinated by Mr Matthias Heger, from Germany.</p><p><sup>30 </sup>See Prel. Doc. No 5/2003, supra, footnote 27, at para. 94.</p><p><sup>31 </sup>Ibid., at para. 147.</p><p><sup>32 </sup>Ibid.</p><p>established29 to proceed on an exchange of views on the subject.30 However, since there was no consensus on this issue, the informal working group did not have any mandate to report to the Special Commission or the Drafting Committee.31</p><p>28. The agreements for and against including in the Convention direct rules of jurisdiction are summarised as follows in the “Report on the First meeting of the Special Commission on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance (5-16 May 2003)”32 at paragraph 88:</p><p>“88. The following is a distillation of the arguments expressed during the Special Commission meeting for and against including in the new instrument uniform direct rules of jurisdiction, whether in respect of the exercise of original jurisdiction or in respect of modification jurisdiction.</p><p>C. In favour of including direct rules of jurisdiction</p><p>(a) A uniform agreed set of jurisdictional rules would promote the goals of clarity, foreseeability and simplicity.</p><p>(b) Agreed jurisdictional standards will foster mutual confidence and provide a firm framework on which to build an effective system of administrative co-operation. Administrative authorities will find their work more difficult if they have to deal with foreign systems operating varying jurisdictional standards.</p><p>(c) Uniform direct rules of jurisdiction provide a firm foundation for a system of recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions, and make it easier to operate simple and rapid procedures for recognition and enforcement.</p><p>(d) Uniform rules help to prevent duplication of litigation and the generation of multiple conflicting decisions. While this may not be a serious problem in relation to the exercise of original jurisdiction (especially where child support is concerned), it is a real problem in the context of jurisdiction to modify an existing order. It is difficult to devise rules which regulate modification jurisdiction without at the same time considering the grounds for exercising original jurisdiction.</p><p>(e) There is likely to be broad agreement in respect of certain heads of jurisdiction, such as defendant’s residence (however defined), or submission of the defendant to the jurisdiction. Also, the idea that the residence (however defined) of the creditor should found jurisdiction is very widely accepted.</p><p>(f) Where there is a situation in which it appears that many or most States would be able to agree on common rules of direct jurisdiction, the opportunity to reflect this in the new instrument should not be lost. The position of a minority of States that cannot join the consensus could be accommodated by an opt-out clause of some sort.</p><p>(g) If, as appears to be the case, the differences are small in terms of practice between those systems which do and those which do not without qualification accept a creditor’s jurisdiction, it ought to be possible to formulate jurisdictional principles which capture the large area of common ground.</p><p>(h) Uniform rules on jurisdiction in Hague Conventions provide a valuable model for reforms in national systems.</p><p>D. Against the inclusion of rules of direct jurisdiction</p><p>12</p><p><sup>33 </sup>Ibid., at para. 88.</p><p><sup>34 </sup>The iSupport system is described in Info. Doc. No 1 “Development of an International Electronic Case Management and Communication System in Support of the Future Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance” of June 2006 for the attention of the Special Commission of June 2006 on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family</p><p>(a) The absence at the international level of agreed jurisdictional standards has not in practice been a serious cause of concern, and is not a source of the major shortcomings currently experienced within the international system. For many States, harmonisation of direct rules of jurisdiction excites little interest.</p><p>(b) Experience has shown that, where different approaches to jurisdiction operate in different systems, where both are supported by principle, and where both seem to work well in practice and give satisfaction within their respective contexts, it may be extremely difficult to reach consensus on a uniform approach.</p><p>(c) The perceived advantages of a uniform system are not such as to justify the energy and time that would need to be devoted to the search for consensus, which may in any case be futile and may prolong negotiations unnecessarily. There is a danger that attention will be distracted away from the real practical problems, in particular putting in place an efficient and responsive system of administrative co-operation.</p><p>(d) A system of recognition and enforcement can operate successfully on the basis of indirect rules of jurisdiction, without the need to agree uniform direct rules. See for example the Hague Convention of 2 October 1973 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions relating to Maintenance Obligations.</p><p>(e) The problems of multiple decisions arising from the exercise of modification jurisdiction may be ameliorated by means other than the elaboration of direct rules of jurisdiction, including for example by provisions relating to recognition and enforcement.</p><p>(f) The establishment of rules of direct jurisdiction at the international level which will inevitably differ in some respects from the rules adopted in regional instruments, raises the complex problem of “disconnection”, i.e. how to define the borderline between cases coming within the scope of the international and regional instruments respectively.</p><p>(g) Any disadvantages, in particular for the maintenance creditor, which may arise from the absence of uniform standards of jurisdiction, may be ameliorated by the introduction of an effective and efficient system of co-operation which maximizes the supports offered to the creditor regardless of the country in which the maintenance application is made.”</p><p>29. Over time, the balance of opinion among experts favoured leaving aside the general issue of uniform direct rules of jurisdiction. While many experts acknowledged the possible advantages of uniform rules, the preponderant view was that any practical benefits to be derived from uniform rules were far outweighed by the cost of embarking on a long, complex and possibly futile attempt to reach a consensus.33</p><p>VI. Information technology</p><p>30. The Preamble on the preliminary draft Convention states “that the States signatory to the present Convention are […] seeking to take advantage of advances in information technology and to create a flexible system which can continue to evolve as needs change and further advances in technology create new opportunities”. In that respect the Convention will invite the use of electronic funds transfers (Art. 31) and will be geared towards the use of cross-border electronic case management and communications systems such as the iSupport software that has been presented on several occasions to the Special Commission during the course of its work.34</p><p>13</p><p>Maintenance. It is highly inspired by the iChild software which is now being implemented around the world in many Central Authorities under the 1980 Child Abduction Convention.</p><p><sup>35 </sup>As a background to this language, the Drafting Committee took on board comments from the UNCITRAL Secretariat to the effect that at this point in time, very few judicial or administrative authorities deliver or accept electronic documents that meet in particular integrity, irrevocability and authentification requirements. Furthermore, where such electronic documents would be transmitted across borders, their in-chain secured electronic transmission through different intermediaries (e.g., the transmission of a decision from a judicial authority in State A to a judicial authority in State B through the requesting and requested Central authorities of States A and B respectively) could either be: a) complex, as the final recipient of the document would need a technology to be able to verify through the chain of communication the authenticity, integrity and irrevocability of the document; or, b) not possible at all, where the two States involved could be using two different electronic communication standards (e.g., Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs)).</p><p><sup>36 </sup>Following the most recent Conventions prepared in the Hague Conference (Hague Convention of 5 July 2006 on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in respect of Securities held with an Intermediary (hereinafter “the 2006 Hague Securities Convention”), 2005 Hague Choice of Court Convention) a heading appears following the number of every article, thereby facilitating the readability and comprehension of the Convention.</p><p>31. The system would assist the effective implementation of the Convention and lead to greater consistency in practice in the different countries. The system would help significantly to improve communications between Central Authorities and alleviate translation problems and costs as it could operate in different languages. Such a system could assist the daily operations of the Central Authorities established under the Convention and help to improve standards of case management. The system could also generate the required statistics as part of the means of monitoring the operation of the Convention. In addition to the management and monitoring of cases, the system could provide instructions to banks with regard to electronic transfer of funds and could send and receive secured online communications and applications under the Convention.</p><p>32. In order to pave the way to these important developments, the Drafting Committee has taken great care to develop a text that would allow the implementation of technologies without endangering due process principles. In this regard, the Drafting Committee benefited to a large extent from the work of the Forms Working Group that examined the practical issues surrounding electronic communication of Forms and other accompanying documents. The result is a text that avoids as much as possible the use of terms such as “signature” (where what is usually needed is a simple identification), “writing”, “original”, “sworn”, and “certified”. Furthermore, exchange of views with the UNCITRAL Secretariat in relation to “authentication” issues helped to inspire new provisions on the transmission of documents and related information. Language has been added to Articles 12(2), 13, 21 and 26, further to the mandate of the Special Commission, to ensure that the language of the Convention is media-neutral, without altering its substance and thereby making possible the swift transmission of documents by the most rapid means of communication available (i.e. technology-neutral).</p><p>33. The aim of the language under Articles 12(2), 13, 21 and 26, is to ensure in a first stage the swift transmission (whatever the medium employed) of applications, including accompanying documents, between Central Authorities while recognising the need for sometimes making available at a later stage (most often probably for evidence purposes), either at the request of the requested Central Authority (Art. 12(2)), or at the request of the competent authority of the State addressed (Art. 21(3)) or upon a challenge or an appeal by the defendant (Art. 21(3)), a complete copy certified by the competent authority in the State of origin of any document specified under Article 21(1) a), b) and d), [and 26(2)].35</p><p>VII. Article-by-article commentary</p><p>CHAPTER I – OBJECT, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS</p><p>Article 1 Object36</p><p>The object of the present Convention is to ensure the effective international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance in particular by –</p><p>34. The main objective of the Convention is to make internationally effective the recovery of maintenance and to the same end the Preamble underlines that the States</p><p>14</p><p><sup>37 </sup>See “Observations of the Drafting Committee on the text of the preliminary draft Convention”, Prel. Doc. No 26 drawn up for the attention of the Twenty-First Session of November 2007 (hereinafter Prel. Doc. No 26/2007), p. 3, under Art. 1.</p><p><sup>38 </sup>See comments on Chapter V (Recognition and enforcement).</p><p>are “aware of the need for procedures which produce results and are accessible, prompt, efficient, cost-effective, responsive, and fair” for the recovery of maintenance.</p><p>35. This Article includes a list of the principal elements in the Convention. The list is not exhaustive, but only enumerates the measures that “in particular” could be adopted, meaning that there may be other possible measures that the States can adopt to improve the way in which the recovery of maintenance is effective.</p><p>36. Nothing in this Article precludes “direct requests” for maintenance (Art. 16(5)), but they are not mentioned in the Article. The reason is that it would be misleading to suggest that provision for “direct requests” is a primary object of the Convention.37 As to direct requests to competent authorities, see Article 34.</p><p>Paragraph a) establishing a comprehensive system of co-operation between the authorities of the Contracting States;</p><p>37. From the beginning of the preparation of the Convention there was a clear desire to establish strong co-operation between the authorities of the Member States, improving the system of the 1956 New York Convention. In this matter, the Hague Conference provides excellent examples with the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention and the 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention.</p><p>38. The rule in Article 1 a) is linked to the scope of the Convention (Art. 2). In fact, while the system of co-operation based on Central Authorities is established for the purpose of the international recovery of child support, its application to other forms of family maintenance may be limited according to the text of Article 2.</p><p>39. In previous drafts of the Convention a reference was made in paragraph a) to the fact that the system of the Convention includes the “establishment of parentage when required for such purpose”, i.e., where this is necessary for the effective recovery of maintenance. The arguments against this inclusion were that it is difficult in some systems for parentage to be established only for the purpose of maintenance and that the establishment of parentage is often a judicial matter. See the discussion in this Report on Article 6(2) h) and on Article 10(1) c). The solution in these Articles makes the reference in Article 1 a) no longer necessary. The Convention is not prejudging the effects that the legislation of the State gives to the establishment of parentage. It is an open solution that allows that in every State this question may be solved by the internal law.</p><p>Paragraph b) making available applications for the establishment of maintenance decisions;</p><p>40. This paragraph is intended to underline the fact that the Convention establishes a system of applications for the establishment or recognition of maintenance decisions and for other procedures that could be useful for the effective collection of maintenance. The available applications are set out in Article 10.</p><p>Paragraph c) providing for the recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions; and</p><p>41. The reference in Article 1 c) of the Convention to the recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions, is to those provisions of the Convention which are designed to facilitate and to simplify the interim measures to which a foreign decision is submitted (what is known as exequatur for judgments) before enforcement under national law may take place.38</p><p>Paragraph d) requiring effective measures for the prompt enforcement of maintenance decisions.</p><p>42. The Convention is not limited to the traditional procedure of exequatur, but also seeks truly to facilitate the execution of the decision, thereby making it effective and this</p><p>15</p><p><sup>39 </sup>See comments on Chapter VI (Enforcement by the requested State).</p><p><sup>40 </sup>See Art. 26.</p><p><sup>41 </sup>In this respect, see also comments on Chapter Art. 17(5), para. 502 of this Report.</p><p><sup>42 </sup>Report of Meeting No 14, p. 2.</p><p><sup>43 </sup>I.e. unless the two States concerned have made a declaration extending Chapters II and III to spousal support, in accordance with Art. 58.</p><p>objective is underlined in paragraph d). But the wording of this provision cannot go further, as specific measures are not required by the Convention. The precise enforcement measures necessary to meet the broad requirements of effectiveness and promptness are a matter for individual Contracting States.39</p><p>43. This provision may need to be amended if authentic instruments and private agreements are to be covered by the Convention.40</p><p>Article 2 Scope</p><p>44. Article 2 defines the material scope of the Convention in a positive way by stating to which cases it applies. The Article begins by describing the core maintenance obligations to which the whole of the Convention applies (para. 1), followed by the obligations to which the Convention, or parts of the Convention may be extended by declaration (para. 2), adding in paragraph 4, a rule for the application of the Convention to claims by a public body. Finally, the rule of paragraph 3 is in brackets, for the reasons explained below.</p><p>Paragraph 1 – This Convention shall apply to maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a child under the age of 21 [including claims for spousal support made in combination with claims for maintenance in respect of such a child] and, with the exception of Chapters II and III, to spousal support.</p><p>45. Paragraph 1 describes the core maintenance obligations to which the whole of the Convention applies and these are maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a child under the age of 21. There are no doubts on this point, accepted by all delegations. The effect of the reference to the age of 21 is different from that in other Conventions on the protection of children (1996 Hague Child Protection Convention or the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child) and in the 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Enforcement) and Article 1 of the 1973 Hague Maintenance Convention (Applicable Law). It does not mean that States are obliged to modify internal rules if the limit for according maintenance in respect of children is below 21. Nor does it mean that States are obliged to modify the age of majority. Paragraph 1 merely fixes the scope of application of the Convention. The only obligation under the Convention will be to recognise and enforce a foreign decision until this age.41</p><p>46. During the Special Commission meeting in June 2006, some concerns were expressed about the situation of spousal support under the Convention.</p><p>47. Firstly, there is the situation where a claim for spousal support is made in combination with the claim for maintenance in respect of such a child.42 For the moment, this possibility is kept in brackets as at least for one delegation the Convention’s mandatory scope should apply only to children. The words “in combination with” have to be understood as “related” or “linked” to child support, regardless of whether the spousal support is claimed together with the child support, because in some countries spousal support is applied for at the same time as child support but in others not.</p><p>48. Secondly, there is the question of the more general application of the Convention to spousal support. After long discussion, it was accepted that the Convention should apply to spousal support, but that the application of Chapters II and III would not be mandatory. That means that the system of administrative co-operation and assistance between the authorities of the Contracting States will not necessarily apply43 for these cases, but that the system of recognition and enforcement will apply, as well as all the other rules included in the Convention.</p><p>16</p><p><sup>44 </sup>See also the debate around Art. 19 a) and comments under para. 510 of this Report.</p><p><sup>45 </sup>See comments to Art. 33 in this Report.</p><p>Paragraph 2 – Any Contracting State may declare in accordance with Article 58 that it will extend the application of the whole or any part of the Convention to any maintenance obligation arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity. Any such declaration shall give rise to obligations between two Contracting States only in so far as their declarations cover the same maintenance obligations and parts of the Convention.</p><p>49. Although a broad majority of States were in favour of a large scope of application for the Convention, other States have constitutional problems, related to the internal distribution of competences, that prevent them from accepting the application of the Convention in general to maintenance obligations in respect of any of the specified family relationships or relationships based on affinity, other than maintenance obligations in respect of children.</p><p>50. This is why the draft of paragraph 2 includes a rule according to which the States “may” declare the extension of the application of the whole or of any part of the Convention to maintenance obligations in res</p></div></div>

Sometimes it can be difficult to know what our basicrights really are. More than fifty years ago Britain helped to enshrine our basic liberties into the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). But we could only claim the protectionof the Convention by taking the long road to Strasbourg. The Human Rights Act means that we can safeguard our rightshere in the UK. And we can all be clearer about the basic values and standards we share. This leaflet introduces the Human Rights Act and says how it works. UK Governments have respected the European Convention for over 50 years.<br/>So you‘ll probably never need the Act. But if your rights ever are infringed, it‘s good to know there’s something you can do about it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">WHAT IS THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Human Rights Act 1998 is a law, which came into full force in October 2000. It gives further effect in the UK to the fundamental rights and freedoms in the European Convention on Human Rights.<br/>WHAT DOES IT DO?<br/>The law does three simple things:  It makes it unlawful for a public authority, like a government department, local authority or the police,<br/>Human Rights Act1 to breach the Convention rights, unless an Act of<br/>Parliament meant it couldn’t have acted differently<br/> It means that human rights cases can be dealt with in a UK<br/>court or tribunal. Until the Act, anyone who felt that their<br/>rights under the Convention had been breached had to go<br/>to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg<br/> It says that all UK legislation must be given a meaning that<br/>fits with the Convention rights, if that’s possible. If a court<br/>says that’s not possible it will be up to Parliament to decide<br/>what to do.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the earliest and most important treaties passed<br/>by the Council of Europe, a group of nations invited by Sir<br/>Winston Churchill to come together after the SecondWorld<br/>War to stop such atrocities and acts of cruelty happening<br/>again.<br/>The Council of Europe is quite separate from the European<br/>Union (EU). It has its own Court of Human Rights in<br/>Strasbourg. You are already able to go to the Strasbourg court<br/>to claim your rights under the ECHR.<br/>However until 2000, the ECHR was not part of the UK’s<br/>domestic law. So our courts had not normally been able to<br/>deal with claims.<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>2<br/>YOUR CONVENTION RIGHTS<br/>There are sixteen basic rights in the Human Rights Act, all<br/>taken from the European Convention on Human Rights. They<br/>don’t only affect matters of life and death like freedomfrom<br/>torture and killing; they also affect your rights in everyday life:<br/>what you can say and do, your beliefs, your right to a fair trial<br/>and many other similar basic entitlements.<br/>(Article 1 is introductory)<br/><strong> </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ARTICLE 2</strong><br/><strong>RIGHT TO LIFE</strong><br/>You have the absolute right to have your life protected by law. There are only certain very limited circumstances where it is acceptable for the State to take away someone’s life, e.g. if a police officer acts justifiably in self defence.<br/><strong>ARTICLE 3</strong><br/><strong>PROHIBITIONOF TORTURE</strong><br/>You have the absolute right not to be tortured or subjected to treatment or punishment which is inhuman or degrading.<br/><strong>ARTICLE 4</strong><br/><strong>PROHIBITIONOF SLAVERY AND FORCED LABOUR</strong><br/>You have the absolute right not to be treated as a slave or forced to perform certain kinds of labour.<br/><strong>ARTICLE 5<br/>RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY</strong><br/>You have the right not to be deprived of your liberty – ‘arrested or detained’- except in limited cases specified in the Article (e.g. where you are suspected or convicted of Human Rights Act3 committing a crime) and where this is justified by a clear legal<br/><strong>procedure.<br/>ARTICLE 6<br/>RIGHT TOA FAIR TRIAL</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">You have the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable period of time. This applies to both criminal charges against you, or in sorting out cases concerning your civil rights and obligations. Hearings must be by an<br/>independent and impartial tribunal established by law. It is possible to exclude the public from the hearing (though not the judgement) if that is necessary to protect things like national security or public order. If it is a criminal charge you are presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law and have certain guaranteed rights to defend yourself.<br/><strong>ARTICLE 7<br/>NO PUNISHMENTWITHOUT LAW</strong><br/>You normally have the right not to be found guilty of an offence arising out of actions which at the time you committed them were not criminal. You are also protected against later increases in the possible sentence for an offence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUALIFIED RIGHTS</strong><br/>The rights in Articles 8 to 11 may be qualified where that is necessary to achieve an important objective.The precise objectives in each Article which allow limitations vary, but they include things like protecting public health or<br/>safety, preventing crime, and protecting the rights of others. Human Rights Act4</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ARTICLE 8<br/>RIGHT TO RESPECT FOR PRIVATE AND FAMILY LIFE</strong><br/>You have the right to respect for your private and family life, your home and your correspondence. This right can only be restricted in specified circumstances.<br/><strong>ARTICLE 9<br/>FREEDOMOF THOUGHT, CONSCIENCE AND RELIGIO</strong>N<br/>You are free to hold a broad range of views, beliefs and<br/>thoughts, as well as religious faith. Limitations are permitted<br/>only in specified circumstances.<br/>ARTICLE 10<br/>FREEDOMOF EXPRESSION<br/>You have the right to hold opinions and express your views on<br/>your own or in a group. This applies even if they are unpopular<br/>or disturbing. This right can only be restricted in specified<br/>circumstances.<br/>ARTICLE 11<br/>FREEDOMOF ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION<br/>You have the right to assemble with other people in a peaceful<br/>way. You also have the right to associate with other people,<br/>which can include the right to form a trade union. These rights<br/>may be restricted only in specified circumstances.<br/>ARTICLE 12<br/>RIGHT TO MARRY<br/>Men and women have the right to marry and start a family.<br/>The national law will still govern how and at what age this can<br/>take place.<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>5<br/>(Article 13 is not included in the Human Rights Act)<br/>ARTICLE 14<br/>PROHIBITIONOF DISCRIMINATION<br/>In the application of the Convention rights, you have the right<br/>not to be treated differently because of your race, religion, sex,<br/>political views or any other status, unless this can be justified<br/>objectively. Everyone must have equal access to Convention<br/>rights, whatever their status.<br/>ARTICLE 1OF PROTOCOL 11<br/>PROTECTIONOF PROPERTY<br/>You have the right to the peaceful enjoyment of your<br/>possessions. Public authorities cannot usually interfere with<br/>things you own or the way you use them except in specified<br/>limited circumstances.<br/>ARTICLE 2OF PROTOCOL 1<br/>RIGHT TO EDUCATION<br/>You have the right not to be denied access to the educational<br/>system.<br/>ARTICLE 3OF PROTOCOL 1<br/>RIGHT TO FREE ELECTIONS<br/>Elections for members of the legislative body (e.g. Parliament)<br/>must be free and fair and take place by secret ballot. Some<br/>qualifications may be imposed on those that are eligible to<br/>vote (e.g. a minimum age).<br/>1 (a ‘protocol’ is a later addition to the Convention)<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>6<br/>PROTOCOL 6 / ARTICLE 1OF PROTOCOL 13<br/>ABOLITIONOF THE DEATH PENALTY<br/>Protocol 6 abolished the death penalty with limited<br/>exceptions in times of war but only in accordance with clearly<br/>specified laws. Protocol 13 replaces Protocol 6 and abolishes<br/>the death penalty in all circumstances.<br/>7<br/>HOWDOES THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AFFECT ME?<br/> DOES THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT CHANGE MY RIGHTS?<br/>No. But the Human Rights Act makes claiming your rights<br/>much quicker and easier. Instead of having to go to<br/>Strasbourg, you can now bring a case in a court in the UK.<br/> DOES THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AFFECT THEWAY<br/>GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES BEHAVE?<br/>Yes. The Human Rights Act says that all public authorities<br/>must pay proper attention to your rights when they are<br/>making decisions that affect you. Public authorities include<br/>government departments, your local authority or health<br/>authority, and also agencies like the police, the courts and<br/>private companies when carrying out public functions.<br/>That’s nothing new – respecting rights and balancing rights<br/>and responsibilities has always been an important part of<br/>public service in this country. But the Human Rights Act makes<br/>sure that those in authority over you will have to check that<br/>they do not ride roughshod over your rights, even when they<br/>believe they are doing so for a good reason. They will have to<br/>be careful about the balance they are striking and think hard<br/>about how they can cause the least possible harm to<br/>individuals.<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>7<br/>Every time Government proposes a new law in Parliament the<br/>responsible Minister has to make a statement under the<br/>Human Rights Act about how the new law fits in with the<br/>Convention rights.<br/> CAN I USE THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AGAINST<br/>ANOTHER PRIVATE INDIVIDUALWHO INFRINGES<br/>MY RIGHTS?<br/>Not directly. You cannot sue, or be sued by, another individual<br/>for breaking the Convention rights. But you may benefit<br/>indirectly because the Human Rights Act means all laws have<br/>to be given a meaning and effect which is as close as possible<br/>to the Convention rights.<br/>It’s also a lot easier to insist on your rights if they are written<br/>down. You can point them out to the person who you think is<br/>ignoring them.<br/> BUTWHAT ABOUT RESPONSIBILITIES?<br/>ARE MY RIGHTS UNDER THE ACT UNLIMITED?<br/>They are not. Most of the rights in the Human Rights Act have<br/>some boundaries to prevent them unfairly affecting the rights<br/>of others – or overriding the rights of the wider community. In<br/>a democratic society everyone has rights. Your rights come<br/>first, but so do everyone else’s. So we all have to accept some<br/>limits on our rights in order to make sure others are treated<br/>fairly.<br/>For example, someone’s right to liberty might have to be<br/>restricted if they have committed a crime. Freedom of speech<br/>cannot mean the freedom to shout ‘Fire!’ in a crowded hall,<br/>when there isn’t one.<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>8<br/> HAS THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT REALLY CHANGED<br/>ANYTHING?<br/>This is a type of higher law, affecting all other laws. The rights<br/>and their limitations are really a set of basic values. Respect<br/>for the rights and everything that goes with them is helping to<br/>change the way people think and behave and to create an<br/>atmosphere in which decisions and policies are discussed and<br/>understood. How far the Human Rights Act improves the<br/>quality of life for all in the UK depends on how far we all<br/>respect the values it enshrines.<br/> WHAT DOES THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT MEAN<br/>FOR DEMOCRACY?<br/>Democracy is the only form of government which fits with the<br/>Convention rights. Tolerance and broadmindedness are the<br/>bedrock of democracy – and the bedrock of the Convention<br/>rights. The Human Rights Act recognises the central place of<br/>Parliament in our democracy.<br/>It should encourage transparency and openness in<br/>Government because public authorities will use the language<br/>of the Convention rights to debate problems. Because that’s a<br/>language we can all understand we will be better able to<br/>understand what’s being said – and to join in.<br/> WILL THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT PLEASE EVERYONE?<br/>Not all the time. There is bound to be argument over some<br/>decisions and clashes between rights.We won’t all agree on<br/>subjects like measures about privacy, victims’ rights or<br/>freedom of expression. The Human Rights Act affects decisions<br/>on these things. Some people are bound to feel that the wrong<br/>answer is reached.<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>9<br/>But the Human Rights Act should ensure proper debate and<br/>that basic rights are respected in a balanced way.<br/> WHAT DOES THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT MEAN<br/>FOROUR COURTS AND JUDGES?<br/>The Human Rights Act helps them to protect individuals’<br/>Convention rights. And they are able to check that the rights<br/>of the wider community are properly balanced. If individuals’<br/>rights have to be affected, the public authority will need to<br/>show that it is not using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. This is<br/>often referred to as ‘proportionality’: interfering with rights<br/>only so far as it is necessary in order to achieve a specific<br/>purpose set out in the Convention.<br/>For example, there is a fundamental right to assembly – and a<br/>right to meet with others.<br/>So if the police or public authorities are thinking of banning<br/>certain demonstrations or restricting marches to certain<br/>routes, they must not just impose a blanket ban. They must<br/>think carefully about what is proportionate so they don’t go<br/>any further than necessary to guard against the risks to others<br/>which they reasonably anticipate. Every court in the land has<br/>been trained to help you when a public authority is acting<br/>against your rights.<br/> SOWILL THE COURTS BE ABLE TOOVERRULE<br/>PARLIAMENT?<br/>No. The Human Rights Act specifically says judges can’t<br/>overrule Parliament. But the courts are able to develop the law<br/>in line with the Convention rights.<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>10<br/>Judges have always been able to develop the law themselves.<br/>But the Human Rights Act means they operate within a<br/>democratic code of values, based on your Convention rights.<br/> DOES THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT MEAN<br/>MORE COURT CASES?<br/>Not in the long run. Going to court is always a last resort. The<br/>Human Rights Act helps to clarify rights and public authorities<br/>understand how the courts interpret the law. In the early days<br/>people tried to use the new law to find out just how the<br/>balance would be struck between their rights and other<br/>people’s rights. But judges have already made it clear that<br/>they will not want to waste time on arguments that have no<br/>merit.<br/>For example, one of our fundamental rights is to marry if we<br/>are of marriageable age. In the UK the law sets this at 16. It<br/>would almost certainly be regarded as a time-waster to go to<br/>court to argue that you should be allowed to marry at a<br/>younger age. This is the sort of decision that every country is<br/>allowed to take for itself.<br/> WHAT ABOUT SCOTLAND,WALES AND<br/>NORTHERN IRELAND?<br/>The Parliament inWestminster has power to pass any laws, no<br/>matter what the Convention says. The Assemblies inWales<br/>and Northern Ireland and the Parliament in Scotland do not<br/>have this power. If they pass laws which don’t fit with the<br/>Convention rights the courts will overrule them.<br/>Human Rights Act<br/>11<br/>HOWCAN I FINDOUT MORE?<br/>For more information about the Human Rights Act visit:<br/>www.humanrights.gov.uk<br/>Or write to: Human Rights Division, Ministry of Justice, 6th<br/>Floor, Selborne House, 54 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6QW<br/>In Northern Ireland write to: The Equality and Human Rights<br/>Unit, Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister<br/>(OFMDFM), Room E3.18, Castle Buildings, Stormont Estate,<br/>Belfast, BT4 3SR<br/>In Scotland write to: Scottish Executive Justice Division, St<br/>Andrew’s House, Regent Road, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG<br/>InWales write to: Strategic Equality &amp; Diversity Unit,Welsh<br/>Assembly Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ<br/>A more detailed guide to the Human Rights Act, called the<br/>Guide to the Human Rights Act, is available in the English and<br/>Welsh languages.

I am very pleased, therefore, that this study on</p><p>human rights and disability was based on an initiative of the Commission on Human</p><p>Rights.</p><p>In 2000 the Commission requested me as High Commissioner to examine what might</p><p>be done to strengthen both the protection and the monitoring of the human rights of</p><p>persons with disability. As a first step it was decided to commission a study on the</p><p>human rights dimensions of disability. The study would, it was hoped, clarify the</p><p>conceptual and policy issues as well as report on both the experience and the potential</p><p>of the international treaty bodies in monitoring and advancing protection.</p><p>This comprehensive and well researched study of human rights and disability is the</p><p>result. I warmly welcome the study and commend it to all concerned with human</p><p>rights and disability. On behalf of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human</p><p>Rights I thank the authors and researchers who have worked together to provide us</p><p>with an indispensable and practical resource for the use of international and national</p><p>human rights mechanisms to defend the human rights of those with disabilities. At the</p><p>same time, the book will be an essential foundation for the further initiatives on</p><p>protection being considered by the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish to</p><p>acknowledge the support of the Government of Ireland, which made the project</p><p>possible.</p><p><strong>Mary Robinson</strong></p><p>High Commissioner for Human Rights</p><p><strong><em>x _______________________________________________________________________________</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Acknowledgements</em></strong></p><p>We would like to acknowledge the considerable assistance and moral encouragement</p><p>received from the following; Dr. Christine Whyte, Policy Officer, National Disability</p><p>Authority of Ireland; the staff of the Office of the United Nations High</p><p>Commissioner for Human Rights, Geneva; Mr. Don Wills, President, International</p><p>Disability Alliance (IDA); Mr. Stephan Tromel, Director, European Disability Forum;</p><p>Mr. Bengt Lindqvist, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Standard Rules for</p><p>the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities; Mr. Miguel-Angel</p><p>Cabra de Luna (ONCE Foundation, Madrid); Mr. Eric Rosenthal (Mental Disability</p><p>Rights International); Dr. Arthur O’Reilly, former Director, National Disability</p><p>Authority of Ireland; Dr. Kate Quinn, Department of Spanish, NUI, Galway;</p><p>Mrs. Agnes O’ Farrell, Disability Liaison Officer, NUI, Galway; Sabine Decker,</p><p>Gabriel Hille, Barbara Duncan and Annegret Deyle (Bochum, Germany).</p><p><strong>Executive summary</strong></p><p>The present study is about the current use and future potential of the United Nations</p><p>human rights instruments in the specific field of disability.</p><p>Over 600 million people, or approximately 10 per cent of the world’s population, have</p><p>a disability of one form or another. Over two thirds of them live in developing</p><p>countries. Only 2 per cent of disabled children in the developing world receive any</p><p>education or rehabilitation. The link between disability and poverty and social</p><p>exclusion is direct and strong throughout the world.</p><p>A dramatic shift in perspective has taken place over the past two decades from an</p><p>approach motivated by charity towards the disabled to one based on rights. In essence,</p><p>the human rights perspective on disability means viewing people with disabilities as</p><p>subjects and not as objects. It entails moving away from viewing people with</p><p>disabilities as problems towards viewing them as holders of rights. Importantly, it</p><p>means locating problems outside the disabled person and addressing the manner in</p><p>which various economic and social processes accommodate the difference of</p><p>disability – or not, as the case may be. The debate about the rights of the disabled is</p><p>therefore connected to a larger debate about the place of difference in society.</p><p>The disability rights debate is not so much about the enjoyment of specific rights as it</p><p>is about ensuring the equal effective enjoyment of all human rights, without</p><p>discrimination, by people with disabilities. The non-discrimination principle helps</p><p>make human rights in general relevant in the specific context of disability, just as it</p><p>does in the contexts of age, sex and children. Non-discrimination, and the equal</p><p>effective enjoyment of all human rights by people with disabilities, are therefore the</p><p>dominant theme of the long-overdue reform in the way disability and the disabled are</p><p>viewed throughout the world.</p><p>The process of ensuring that people with disabilities enjoy their human rights is slow</p><p>and uneven. But it is taking place, in all economic and social systems. It is inspired by</p><p>the values that underpin human rights: the inestimable dignity of each and every</p><p>human being, the concept of autonomy or self-determination that demands that the</p><p>person be placed at the centre of all decisions affecting him/her, the inherent equality</p><p>of all regardless of difference, and the ethic of solidarity that requires society to</p><p>sustain the freedom of the person with appropriate social supports.</p><p>The shift to the human rights perspective has been authoritatively endorsed at the</p><p>level of the United Nations over the past two decades. This is best exemplified by the</p><p>United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for People with</p><p>Disabilities, adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 48/96 of 20 December</p><p>1993. The Rules are monitored by a United Nations Special Rapporteur, Bengt</p><p>Lindqvist, who has received his mandate from the United Nations Commission for</p><p>Social Development. The Rules, and especially the role played by the Special</p><p>Rapporteur, continue to make a vital contribution to the process of raising</p><p>consciousness about the human rights of persons with disabilities and in stimulating</p><p>positive change throughout the world.</p><p><strong><em>2 ______________________________________________________________ Executive summary</em></strong></p><p>The United Nations human rights treaty bodies have considerable potential in this</p><p>field but have generally been underused in advancing the rights of persons with</p><p>disabilities. The study focuses on the bodies monitoring six main United Nations</p><p>human rights treaties: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural</p><p>Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention</p><p>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the</p><p>Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All</p><p>Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Convention on the</p><p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The main thesis of the study is</p><p>that the process of disability reform that is taking place across the globe could be</p><p>immeasurably strengthened and accelerated if greater and more targeted use were</p><p>made of these instruments.</p><p>It has to be emphasized that the primary responsibility for ensuring respect for the</p><p>human rights of persons with disabilities rests with States. That is, the use and value</p><p>of the United Nations human rights machinery is vindicated by meaningful domestic</p><p>reform. The human rights instruments provide not merely guidance, but place</p><p>obligations on States parties to reform.</p><p>States parties are demonstrably moving in the direction of the human rights</p><p>perspective on disability. Recent research shows that 39 States in all parts of the world</p><p>have adopted non-discrimination or equal opportunity legislation in the context of</p><p>disability. States parties’ dialogue with the human rights treaty bodies is constructive</p><p>in the context of their efforts to secure disability reform; a significant amount of good</p><p>practice now exists on a worldwide basis which can be usefully propagated through</p><p>the human rights treaty system.</p><p>The shift to the human rights perspective is also reflected in the fact that national</p><p>institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world</p><p>have begun to take an active interest in disability issues. This is important since these</p><p>institutions help in providing a bridge between international human rights law and</p><p>domestic debates about disability law and policy reform. National institutions are</p><p>strategic partners in the process of change, and their increasing engagement on the</p><p>issue of human rights for persons with disabilities is a highly encouraging sign for the</p><p>future.</p><p>People with disabilities themselves are now framing their long-felt sense of grievance</p><p>and injustice into the language of rights. Isolated injustices need no longer be</p><p>experienced in isolation. NGOs working with disability issues such as the</p><p>collaborative project Disability Awareness in Action are beginning to see themselves</p><p>also as human rights NGOs. They are beginning to collect and process hard</p><p>information on alleged violations of the human rights of persons with disabilities.</p><p>While still relatively limited, their human rights capacities are growing. A similar</p><p>process of self-transformation is under way within traditional human rights NGOs,</p><p>which are increasingly approaching disability as a mainstream human rights issue.</p><p>This is important, since these NGOs have highly developed structures, and the</p><p>development of a healthy synergy between disability NGOs and traditional human</p><p>rights NGOs is not only long overdue, but inevitable.</p><p>All in all, the time is right for a stock-taking of the current use and future potential of</p><p>the United Nations human rights instruments in the context of disability.</p><p><strong><em>Executive summary ______________________________________________________________ 3</em></strong></p><p><strong>Aims of the study</strong></p><p>The study has three main aims.</p><p>The first aim is clarify the relevance of the six United Nations human rights treaties to</p><p>disability. In order to do this, the study will identify the various obligations of States</p><p>parties under the treaties and explain how the relevant enforcement mechanisms work</p><p>in the context of disability. We hope that it will constitute a useful reference work for</p><p>all stakeholders, including the States parties, the treaty monitoring bodies, the Office</p><p>of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, national human rights institutions and</p><p>civil society. It does not purport to be exhaustive. It creates added value for the</p><p>existing literature by demonstrating the relevance of the human rights protections</p><p>provided for under the six treaties to disability. More refined analysis will be needed</p><p>as the debate moves on.</p><p>The second aim of the study is to review how the system actually works in practice</p><p>with respect to disability, by looking at how States parties report to the treaty</p><p>monitoring bodies on human rights and disability and how the treaty monitoring</p><p>bodies respond. A total of approximately 147 recent periodic State party reports were</p><p>examined. They were selected on the basis of the availability of documentation and to</p><p>ensure a reasonable geographic spread. No criticism of any State party is intended.</p><p>The object of this analysis was simply to derive some sense of how States parties saw</p><p>themselves as discharging their obligations in the specific context of disability.</p><p>Indeed, no criticism is intended of the treaty monitoring bodies. Their attention and</p><p>scarce resources are drawn in many different directions, and the fact that they have</p><p>developed a sense of the relevance of the various human rights treaties in the context</p><p>of disability attests to their understanding that disability is a human rights issue. While</p><p>our analysis with respect to the evaluative component of the study does not purport to</p><p>be scientific, it nevertheless provides a sufficient basis for general conclusions to be</p><p>drawn – conclusions that we hope will help to mainstream disability issues in a more</p><p>sustained and focused manner.</p><p>The third aim of the study – the main one – is to provide options for the future. As</p><p>such, it provides observations, comments and recommendations as to how the various</p><p>stakeholders might enhance the use of the six human rights instruments in the context</p><p>of disability. The study aims at strengthening the system, while arguing for the</p><p>adoption of a thematic convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. For a</p><p>variety of reasons, the authors conclude that such a convention is necessary and would</p><p>underpin – and not undermine – the existing instruments in the field of disability.</p><p><strong>Outline of the study</strong></p><p>The study is divided into three parts.</p><p>Part 1 examines the nature of the shift to the human rights framework of reference in</p><p>the context of disability. It is composed of three chapters.</p><p>Chapter 1 explains the relevance of human rights values and doctrine to disability. It</p><p>asserts that the core problem in the field of disability is the relative invisibility of</p><p>persons with disabilities, both in society and under the existing international human</p><p>rights instruments. It concludes that the main human rights challenge is</p><p><strong><em>4 ______________________________________________________________ Executive summary</em></strong></p><p>accommodating the difference of disability and making people with disabilities visible</p><p>within the treaty system.</p><p>Chapter 2 recounts briefly how the shift of perspective was given authoritative</p><p>expression in a wide variety of instruments adopted in the context of the</p><p>United Nations system over the past two decades. It sets the stage for an examination</p><p>of how the United Nations human rights treaty system is currently accommodating the</p><p>rights of persons with disabilities.</p><p>Chapter 3 presents the United Nations human rights treaty system and provides the</p><p>bridge between so-called “soft law” and “hard law”. One important operating</p><p>principle of the study is that it is necessary to cross over this bridge and to make full</p><p>use of the human rights treaties in the context of disability.</p><p>Part 2 of the study is an evaluation of the current use of the United Nations human</p><p>rights instruments, providing a detailed analysis of the actual and potential relevance</p><p>of each of the six human rights treaties in the context of disability. This part is</p><p>composed of six chapters corresponding to the six treaties.</p><p>The analysis contained in Part 2 is intended to be part expository and part evaluative.</p><p>The expository dimension involves making the contents of the treaties transparently</p><p>relevant in the context of disability. Each of the rights protected is examined and its</p><p>relevance elucidated. The evaluative part is made up of a series of case studies on how</p><p>the provisions of the respective treaties are applied in general in the context of</p><p>disability.</p><p>Chapter 4 deals with freedom and disability under the ICCPR. This treaty is looked at</p><p>first because the key ethic of the worldwide disability rights movement is freedom and</p><p>participation. In other words, what people with disabilities aspire to most is to have</p><p>access to the same rights – and civic responsibilities – as all other persons. Consistent</p><p>respect for the ICCPR rights of the disabled would not merely protect people with</p><p>disabilities against abuses, but would also be a huge help in breaking down barriers to</p><p>the mainstream. In the sample of States parties’ reports surveyed, many States</p><p>continue to report on disability as a welfare issue and not as a rights issue under the</p><p>ICCPR. The authors found approximately nine individual complaints addressing</p><p>disability issues submitted to the Human Rights Committee under the first Optional</p><p>Protocol to the Covenant. Most were found to be inadmissible. At least one complaint</p><p>has led to very positive case law on the treatment of prisoners with disabilities. In</p><p>essence, the Committee held that it is the duty of States parties to accommodate</p><p>prisoners with special needs. This shows an awareness on the part of the Committee</p><p>that it is not enough to treat all persons the same, but that added allowance (or</p><p>“reasonable accommodation”) may be necessary to make rights “real” for people with</p><p>disabilities. This positive normative development offers great promise for persons</p><p>with disabilities.</p><p>Chapter 5 deals with the ethic of social justice and disability in the context of</p><p>disability. Disability is one of the best areas in which to assert and prove the</p><p>indivisibility and interdependence of civil, political, economic, social and cultural</p><p>rights. Using formal law to break down barriers to the mainstream is necessary but not</p><p>sufficient. People with disabilities must be afforded freedom, but also the means to</p><p>take advantage of it. This can be done by providing relevant social supports and, in</p><p><strong><em>Executive summary ______________________________________________________________ 5</em></strong></p><p>particular, by respecting economic, social and cultural rights. The authors decided to</p><p>place this chapter after the one on the ICCPR in view of the standing danger that</p><p>ICESCR rights will be viewed as being of primary importance in the context of</p><p>disability since they are so obviously connected with social support. In the admirable</p><p>General Comment No. 5 on persons with disabilities adopted by the Committee on</p><p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1994, the Committee views the rights in the</p><p>Covenant as providing the indispensable means of empowering people with</p><p>disabilities in their own lives and providing ongoing support for a life of active</p><p>participation in society. The right to health (art. 12), for example, is interpreted by the</p><p>Committee as having a direct link to participation in society. In the sample of States</p><p>parties’ reports surveyed, States parties tend not to draw the link between ICESCR</p><p>rights and the achievement of the goals of independence, autonomy and participation.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, General Comment No. 5 remains a landmark and the Covenant</p><p>in general has a hugely important role to play in sensitizing all stakeholders to how</p><p>appropriate social supports and rights can best be used to break down barriers and</p><p>enable people with disabilities to participate in all spheres of life.</p><p>Chapter 6 deals with the important question of protecting people with disabilities</p><p>against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment under the Convention</p><p>against Torture. This is especially relevant to the many millions of people with</p><p>disabilities who live in institutions or in other types of residential care. Disability</p><p>reinforces the imbalance of power in many such institutions and heightens the</p><p>vulnerability of people with disabilities to abuse. Disability issues tend not to figure</p><p>prominently in the sample of periodic reports surveyed. One individual complaint</p><p>concerning the situation of disabled prisoners that was submitted to the Committee</p><p>against Torture (CAT) was ruled inadmissible on the grounds that domestic remedies</p><p>had not been exhausted.</p><p>Chapter 7 deals with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of</p><p>Discrimination against Women insofar as it is relevant to women with disabilities.</p><p>General Comment No. 5 refers to a tendency to think of people with disabilities as</p><p>genderless. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women</p><p>(CEDAW) has itself adopted General Recommendation No. 18 on women with</p><p>disabilities which requests States parties to include information on women with</p><p>disabilities in their periodic reports with respect to their exercise of several rights</p><p>contained in the Convention. In the sample of periodic reports surveyed there was</p><p>little consistent reporting on the double discrimination experienced by women with</p><p>disabilities.</p><p>Chapter 8 deals with the Convention on the Rights of the Child insofar as it is relevant</p><p>to children with disabilities. The Convention is unique among the human rights</p><p>treaties in that it contains a specific article on disabled children (art. 23). This article</p><p>is, of course, without prejudice to the general applicability of all of the Convention’s</p><p>provisions to children with disabilities. The Committee on the Rights of the Child</p><p>(CRC) has an impressively high level of awareness of disability issues. In 1997, it</p><p>held an important day of general discussion on disabled children which has had a very</p><p>positive impact on how the Committee addresses the situation pertaining to children</p><p>with disabilities. The Committee seems to be well on the way to developing a</p><p>coherent perspective on children with disabilities.</p><p><strong><em>6 ______________________________________________________________ Executive summary</em></strong></p><p>Chapter 9 deals with another sub-group of the disabled, namely disabled persons who</p><p>also belong to racial or other minority groups. While such persons may be</p><p>discriminated against largely on account of their race, the possibility of double</p><p>discrimination cannot be discounted. Indeed, the phenomenon of double</p><p>discrimination on the ground of race and disability was expressly acknowledged at the</p><p>World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related</p><p>Intolerance. Many States parties already include information on discrimination on the</p><p>ground of disability on a regular basis in their periodic reports to CERD, generally by</p><p>providing background information on their general anti-discrimination laws. This</p><p>provides CERD with a useful opportunity for dialogue with States parties on double</p><p>discrimination.</p><p>Part 3 of the study outlines options for the future. It is composed of four chapters.</p><p>Chapter 10 contains the authors’ analysis of a detailed questionnaire that was sent out</p><p>to disability NGOs around the world. There were about 80 responses from</p><p>international NGOs, regional NGOs and domestic NGOs from every part of the</p><p>world. The response rate was good given the time constraints. It had been decided to</p><p>send the questionnaire to disability NGOs and not to traditional human rights NGOs</p><p>in order to gauge whether and how they address the issues as human rights issues and</p><p>what their views on the existing treaty system are.</p><p>An analysis of the responses reveals the extent to which the disability NGOs have</p><p>themselves made the transition to the rights-based perspective on disability. Many of</p><p>the NGOs that responded to the questionnaire stated that they saw themselves</p><p>primarily as human rights NGOs. Many of them use United Nations human rights</p><p>doctrine in their work. Some of them already have some experience of engagement</p><p>with the United Nations human rights treaty system and generally had positive things</p><p>to say about this experience. Most of them felt inhibited by a general lack of material</p><p>and human resources and were deterred by the seeming inaccessibility of information</p><p>about how the human rights treaties work in the context of disability.</p><p>These findings are highly positive. They show how the shift to the human rights</p><p>perspective is being mirrored in the self-understanding of the disability NGOs, who</p><p>are interested in engaging with the United Nations human rights machinery. They also</p><p>reveal factors inhibiting such engagement. The analysis of the findings could usefully</p><p>be complemented in the future by an analysis of how traditional human rights NGOs</p><p>are themselves beginning to absorb disability as a mainstream human rights issue.</p><p>Doubtless a convergence of perspective is now under way.</p><p>Chapter 11 looks at the experiences and views of national human rights institutions</p><p>and factors in their views. It contains the authors’ analysis of a questionnaire sent to</p><p>national institutions and, again, the response rate was good given the time constraints.</p><p>An analysis of the responses reveals that national institutions are in fact acutely aware</p><p>of the human rights perspective on disability. Many of them have already produced</p><p>important studies and reports on the question of the human rights of persons with</p><p>disabilities. Some of these reports have been highly influential in helping to reform</p><p>domestic disability law and policy. All of the respondent national institutions</p><p>expressed a keen interest in the field and also a willingness to step up their activities</p><p>in this regard. This is a highly positive and encouraging finding and augurs well for</p><p>the future.</p><p><strong><em>Executive summary ______________________________________________________________ 7</em></strong></p><p>Chapter 12 sets out a range of observations, comments and recommendations</p><p>designed to enhance the future use of the United Nations human rights system in the</p><p>context of disability. For the sake of completeness, they are addressed to a wide</p><p>variety of stakeholders in the field.</p><p>State practice with respect to periodic reporting on disability is clearly improving.</p><p>This is, no doubt, due to the increasing attention paid to disability and human rights in</p><p>the United Nations system over the past two decades and especially under the</p><p>United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for People with</p><p>Disabilities. With respect to the States parties, the authors make three</p><p>recommendations designed to ensure heightened visibility for disability in the treaty</p><p>system. Specifically, they recommend: (a) that States parties step up their efforts to</p><p>report regularly on the situation affecting the rights of persons with disabilities; (b)</p><p>that they consult with disability NGOs when compiling their respective periodic</p><p>reports, it being understood that final responsibility for reports rests exclusively with</p><p>the States parties; and (c) that they consider nominating persons with disabilities for</p><p>membership in the six treaty monitoring bodies.</p><p>The treaty monitoring bodies do an excellent job overall on the issue of disability</p><p>given their limited resources and the obvious need to deal with a wide variety of</p><p>issues and groups. Again, the spirit and language of the United Nations Standard</p><p>Rules has had an impact in this regard. The following recommendations are made in</p><p>the spirit of assisting the treaty monitoring bodies to enhance further their treatment of</p><p>disability issues. Specifically, the authors recommend: (a) that they emulate the good</p><p>practice of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and adopt general</p><p>comments on the nature of State obligations under the respective treaties in the</p><p>context of disability; (b) that they emulate the good practice of the Committee on the</p><p>Rights of the Child by setting aside a thematic day of discussion, or similar occasion,</p><p>on disability; (c) that the list of issues sent to States parties by those treaty monitoring</p><p>bodies that issue such documents more regularly request information on the</p><p>enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities, in keeping with the thematic</p><p>priorities to be set in general comments; (d) that the dialogue with States parties</p><p>feature disability issues on a more regular basis; (e) that concluding observations</p><p>contain references to disability, where necessary, in order to identify areas where</p><p>more sustained attention is required and to request more detailed information from</p><p>States parties in subsequent reports; (f) that concluding observations be used more</p><p>regularly to highlight good practice for the benefit of all the stakeholders.</p><p>The Commission on Human Rights and the Office of the High Commissioner for</p><p>Human Rights have demonstrated their engagement with the issue of human rights</p><p>and disability. This is important at the symbolic level, but it is also significant from a</p><p>practical point of view given the pivotal role played by the Office in the overall</p><p>United Nations human rights system. The authors’ recommendations in this regard are</p><p>geared towards enhancing this engagement. Specifically, they recommend that the</p><p>Commission on Human Rights encourage the Office: (a) to make knowledge</p><p>concerning the relevance and operation of the United Nations human rights system in</p><p>the specific context of disability more accessible by adding a disability-specific</p><p>dimension to its web site (with appropriate and extensive links to the relevant</p><p>activities of other sectors of the United Nations, the specialized agencies and national</p><p>institutions); (b) to plan, after consultation with the stakeholders, a series of more</p><p><strong><em>8 ______________________________________________________________ Executive summary</em></strong></p><p>focused thematic studies and practical manuals on subjects such as the human rights</p><p>of institutionalized persons, the right to education for disabled children, the principle</p><p>of non-discrimination and the value of human diversity in the context of genetics,</p><p>bioethics and disability, and the human rights issues connected with intellectual</p><p>disability; (c) to assign at least one staff member on a full-time basis to the question of</p><p>disability and human rights issues; (d) to indicate that it welcomes applications for</p><p>internships from disabled persons; (e) to play a role in stimulating university-based</p><p>human rights programmes to become more actively involved in human rights and</p><p>disability; (f) to take a leading role in advancing the cause of the human rights of</p><p>persons with disabilities within the wider United Nations system, with due regard to</p><p>the equal ownership of the issue by all relevant institutional stakeholders. It is</p><p>important that the human rights perspective on disability continue to be increasingly</p><p>mainstreamed throughout the United Nations system, including in the relevant</p><p>development activities. It is also important that the issue should be multi-tracked</p><p>among all the concerned entities. More guidance from OHCHR could aid</p><p>immeasurably in the process of mainstreaming, as well as enhance the contributions</p><p>of the various and diverse elements of the system. The authors also recommend that</p><p>the Office explore options for bringing together the treaty monitoring bodies to</p><p>discuss the relevance and the potential contribution of their respective treaties in the</p><p>context of disability.</p><p>With respect to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the authors</p><p>recommend that it maintain and enhance the process of mainstreaming disability as a</p><p>human rights issue in its work and that it give active consideration to the appointment</p><p>of a special rapporteur on the human rights of persons with disabilities. The authors</p><p>believe that there is a need for such an entity to raise the visibility of the disability</p><p>issue as a human rights issue and to provide a focal point for disability in the human</p><p>rights system.</p><p>With respect to the national human rights institutions, the authors recommend that</p><p>they actively consider forming a forum or working group on disability and human</p><p>rights. Such a forum would enable the national institutions to develop a deeper</p><p>understanding of disability as a human rights issue and enable them to exchange</p><p>valuable experiences.</p><p>With respect to civil society, the authors recommend that the disability NGOs</p><p>combine their resources and form an international Disability Human Rights Watch or</p><p>similar body that could help raise levels of awareness as well as human rights</p><p>capacities within the disability sector. Such a grouping should develop close ties with</p><p>the mainstream human rights NGOs in order to learn from their experiences and also</p><p>in order to influence them to adopt disability as a human rights issue. The authors</p><p>highlight good practice in the form of funding from the Swedish International</p><p>Development Agency for a project on the human rights of children with disabilities.</p><p>Given that the majority of people with disabilities live in developing countries, the</p><p>authors believe that other donor countries should fund human rights projects in the</p><p>area of disability as part of their development, democratization and human rights</p><p>programmes.</p><p>Chapter 13 deals with the possibility of augmenting the existing human rights system</p><p>in the context of disability with the adoption of a thematic treaty on the rights of</p><p>persons with disabilities. In November 2001, the General Assembly adopted a historic</p><p><strong><em>Executive summary ______________________________________________________________ 9</em></strong></p><p>resolution to establish an ad hoc committee, open to the participation of all Member</p><p>States, to consider proposals for a comprehensive and integral international</p><p>convention to protect and promote the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities,</p><p>based on the holistic approach in the work done in the field of social development,</p><p>human rights and non-discrimination and taking into account the recommendations of</p><p>the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission for Social Development.</p><p>The authors find the arguments for such a convention to be highly persuasive. It</p><p>would enable attention to be focused on disability and would tailor general human</p><p>rights norms to meet the particular circumstances of persons with disabilities. It would</p><p>add visibility to the disability issue within the human rights system. It would have</p><p>practical advantages for all the stakeholders inasmuch as States parties would be</p><p>clearer on their precise obligations in the disability field, and civil society would also</p><p>be able to focus on one coherent set of norms rather than six different sets of norms.</p><p>These advantages were long ago spelled out by Leandro Despouy, the Special</p><p>Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission, in his study on disability, <em>Human Rights and</em></p><p><em>Disabled Persons</em>, published in 1992.</p><p>The authors view such a convention as underpinning – and not undermining – the web</p><p>of existing human rights treaties insofar as they relate to disability. That is, such a</p><p>convention should enable the relevant treaty monitoring body to develop normative</p><p>expertise in the field, and this should, in turn, help to stimulate the mainstreaming of</p><p>disability into the existing human rights system. A convention would address</p><p>collectively people with physical, sensory, mental or intellectual disabilities. The</p><p>drafting process should provide an occasion for considering how best to use all human</p><p>rights – civil, political, economic, social and cultural – to achieve the goal of full</p><p>participation in society of people with disabilities. The convention should include</p><p>appropriate protections, especially for those persons with disabilities who are</p><p>institutionalized.</p><p>All in all, the United Nations is entering an exciting phase of its activities in the field</p><p>of human rights and disabilities. Disability issues are being brought home into the</p><p>human rights domain. The authors are confident that the range of suggestions and</p><p>recommendations contained in the study and outlined above will lead to more and</p><p>better use of the six human rights treaties in the context of disability. They are also</p><p>confident that a thematic treaty would immeasurably advance the rights of persons</p><p>with disabilities, while at the same time enhancing the capacity of the existing</p><p>instruments to respond appropriately.</p><p>– – –</p><p><strong>Part 1</strong></p><p><strong>Background: The shift to a human rights framework</strong></p><p><strong>of reference</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p><p><strong>The moral authority for change: human rights values and</strong></p><p><strong>the worldwide process of disability reform</strong></p><p>Gerard Quinn, Theresia Degener</p><p>Disability is a human rights issue!

They tended to be viewed as</p><p>objects rather than subjects in their own right and the legal protections normally</p><p>associated with the rule of law were either not applied at all or were severely</p><p>curtailed.</p><p>Seeing people with disabilities as subjects rather than objects entails giving them</p><p>access to the full benefits of basic freedoms that most people take for granted and</p><p>doing so in a way that is respectful and accommodating of their difference. It means</p><p>abandoning the tendency to perceive people with disabilities as problems and viewing</p><p>them instead in terms of their rights.</p><p><strong><em>14 _____________________________________________________________ Part 1: Background</em></strong></p><p><strong>1.1 Human values – the human being as subject and not object</strong></p><p>The core values of the human rights mission underpin a system of basic freedoms that</p><p>affords protection against the abuse of power and creates space for the development of</p><p>the human spirit. Four values – dignity, autonomy, equality and solidarity – are of</p><p>particular importance, both in general terms and in the context of disability.</p><p><em>(a) Human dignity and the social construct of disability</em></p><p>Human dignity is the anchor norm of human rights. Each individual is deemed to be</p><p>of inestimable value and nobody is insignificant. People are to be valued not just</p><p>because they are economically or otherwise useful but because of their inherent selfworth.</p><p>Recognition of the value of human dignity serves as a powerful reminder that people</p><p>with disabilities have a stake in and a claim on society that must be honoured quite</p><p>apart from any considerations of social or economic utility. They are ends in</p><p>themselves and not means to the ends of others. This view militates strongly against</p><p>the contrary social impulse to rank people in terms of their usefulness and to screen</p><p>out those with significant differences.</p><p>Dignity as a value has been a crucial factor in the switch to a human rights perspective</p><p>on disability. Owing to their relative invisibility, people with disabilities were often</p><p>treated in the past as objects to be protected or pitied. The crucial change came when</p><p>they saw themselves (and were seen by others) as subjects and not as objects.</p><p>The seventeenth-century English historian William Blackstone described women’s</p><p>loss of full legal personality on marriage as a form of “civil death”. The main aim of</p><p>reform ever since has been to restore to women all the indicia of legal personhood on</p><p>genuinely equal terms with men – to change their status from object to subject. Much</p><p>the same can be said of people with disabilities except that civil death in their case has</p><p>occurred either at birth or at the moment of disablement later in life.</p><p>The “medical model” of disability has frequently been contrasted in recent years with</p><p>the “human rights” model. The medical model focuses on persons’ medical traits such</p><p>as their specific impairments. This has the effect of locating the “problem” of</p><p>disability within the person. The medical model encapsulates a broader and deeper</p><p>social attitude – a tendency to problematize the person and view him/her as an object</p><p>for clinical intervention.</p><p>The human rights model focuses on the inherent dignity of the human being and</p><p>subsequently, but only if necessary, on the person’s medical characteristics. It places</p><p>the individual centrestage in all decisions affecting him/her and, most importantly,</p><p>locates the main “problem” outside the person and in society. The “problem” of</p><p>disability under this model stems from a lack of responsiveness by the State and civil</p><p>society to the difference that disability represents. It follows that the State has a</p><p>responsibility to tackle socially created obstacles in order to ensure full respect for the</p><p>dignity and equal rights of all persons.</p><p>Another way of making the same point is to describe disability as a “social construct”.</p><p>This idea is quite simple and straightforward although it is often clouded by</p><p><strong><em>Chapter 1: Moral authority for change ____________________________________________ 15</em></strong></p><p>theoretical analysis. The first premise of the “social construct” model is that human</p><p>difference is not innate but something socially constructed and applied through labels</p><p>such as “the disabled”. Thus, one is not born “black” or “a woman” or “disabled”.</p><p>One is labelled as such in relation to some unstated norm such as maleness, being</p><p>white or being able-bodied (for want of a better expression).</p><p>The second premise is that the norm in relation to which one is evaluated and labelled</p><p>(maleness, whiteness, being able-bodied) is generally not selected through a neutral or</p><p>disinterested process. Selection usually occurs through an apparatus of power whose</p><p>minimum goal is to preserve that power. Indeed many disability rights advocates</p><p>consider that “the disabled” should be used instead of “persons with disabilities”</p><p>precisely in order to highlight the fact that it is society which disables the person.</p><p>The third premise of the social construct model is crucial, namely that the social</p><p>construct of disability is used not only to <strong><em>set people apart </em></strong>but also to <strong><em>keep people</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>apart</em></strong>. All points of access to the structures of everyday life – the world of education,</p><p>of work, of the family or of social interaction – are established largely by reference to</p><p>the dominant norm, in this instance that of the able-bodied. As deviations or</p><p>differences from the arbitrarily selected norm are generally not catered for, difference</p><p>serves as a ground for subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) exclusion. For example,</p><p>the built environment is constructed for those who can walk and not for those who use</p><p>wheelchairs. The communications environment generally assumes a capacity to listen</p><p>and to speak. The education environment makes little allowance for different ways of</p><p>learning and so on.</p><p>A powerful link can be forged between the “social construct” model of disability and</p><p>the human rights perspective on disability. Society has ignored or discounted the</p><p>difference of disability in regulating the terms of entry into and participation in the</p><p>mainstream, thus excluding – or effectively excluding –10 per cent of any given</p><p>population. This is not merely irrational from an economic point of view; it also</p><p>violates the inherent dignity of all human beings.</p><p>To state the matter in positive terms, the end goal from the perspective of the human</p><p>rights model is to build societies that are genuinely inclusive, societies that value</p><p>difference and respect the dignity and equality of all human beings regardless of</p><p>difference. In this regard, the disability rights movement is very much in tune with a</p><p>deeper and broader movement to create genuinely inclusive societies for all. It has</p><p>been described as the “next generation” civil rights movement.</p><p><em>(b) Autonomy and creation of space for the</em></p><p><em>development of the human spirit</em></p><p>Autonomy as a value associated with dignity derives from the ancient Greek</p><p>commitment to autonomy or self-governance. It entails opening up a free or</p><p>uncoerced space for voluntary action based on a person’s conscience and freely made</p><p>life choices, while preserving comparable liberty for others.</p><p>The value of autonomy is based on the presumption of a capacity for self-directed</p><p>action and behaviour. It thus rests on the implicit image of a “morally free” person –</p><p>an image that has long been deeply contested. There are two main problems with this</p><p>ideal image in the context of disability. One is that society seems over-inclined in</p><p><strong><em>16 _____________________________________________________________ Part 1: Background</em></strong></p><p>many instances to conflate disability – especially intellectual disability – with a lack</p><p>of capacity for moral freedom. This presumption often rests on sheer prejudice. The</p><p>human rights perspective on disability involves a much more nuanced approach, one</p><p>that is not over-inclined to detect incompetence and that places equal emphasis on the</p><p>need for effective protection of the rights and interests of those proclaimed legally</p><p>incompetent.</p><p>The other problem is that society often fails to take seriously the autonomy of persons</p><p>with disabilities who enjoy full legal competence. Their life choices are not perceived</p><p>to be as worthy of social support as those of the non-disabled. Low expectations have</p><p>led to neglect of the material conditions that people with disabilities need to take</p><p>control of their lives and live as they wish. For the most part, societies have not done</p><p>enough to <em>enable </em>those with disabilities who have a clear capacity for moral freedom</p><p>to exercise their right of self-determination. It is one thing to have the ability to study</p><p>astrophysics despite disability – it is another to be able to do so in the absence of</p><p>accessible transportation.</p><p><em>(c) Equality – valuing difference</em></p><p>Human equality, a related value, is also central to the system of basic freedoms</p><p>postulated by human rights law. Its core premise is that all persons not only possess</p><p>inestimable inherent self-worth but are also inherently equal in terms of self-worth,</p><p>regardless of their difference. Thus, distinctions between persons stemming from</p><p>factors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view (race, gender, age, disability)</p><p>should be treated as having no rational foundation and therefore invalid.</p><p>This is not to say that there are no differences between people. In positive terms, it</p><p>means that a genuinely equal society is one that has a positive approach to and</p><p>positively accommodates human difference. Valuing human difference is the aim of</p><p>the “social construct” approach and is also validated by the human rights perspective.</p><p>It is crucially important to an understanding of international developments to realize</p><p>that there are at least three ways of understanding the concept of equality. The</p><p>interpretation chosen affects what one identifies as “wrong” in contemporary social</p><p>arrangements and what remedies are deemed appropriate.</p><p>1. The first interpretation of equality focuses on the need for even-handedness by</p><p>parliaments when they create inevitable distinctions in law and policy. This</p><p>interpretation of formal or juridical equality is, of course, vital and will continue to</p><p>form the bedrock of any understanding of equality. However, it is not sufficiently</p><p>attuned to the concrete needs of those who are in fact “different” or who are not</p><p>similarly situated.</p><p>On the other hand, to insist on strict equality between persons with disabilities and</p><p>other persons would be to ignore real differences. A formal anti-discrimination law,</p><p>for instance, may proscribe disability discrimination but fail to move beyond the</p><p>“equality as neutrality” philosophy and take the further vital step of requiring</p><p>“reasonable accommodation” of the difference of disability. This kind of “equality” is</p><p>plainly hollow. It confers illusory benefits and invites cynicism vis-à-vis the law.</p><p>Although the endeavour to accommodate real differences within a theory of equality</p><p><strong><em>Chapter 1: Moral authority for change ____________________________________________ 17</em></strong></p><p>may result in paradox and pose its own set of problems, it seems necessary to make</p><p>equality meaningful and to produce real change.</p><p>2. A second interpretation of equality is “equality of opportunity”. Most modern</p><p>thinking accepts the “equal opportunity model” as the most appropriate one in the</p><p>context of disability. According to this philosophy, factors over which a person has no</p><p>control and which are thus “arbitrary from a moral point of view” should not be</p><p>allowed to dictate that person’s life chances. Familiar examples are social status,</p><p>colour, gender and disability.</p><p>Taking the ethic of “equality of opportunity” seriously in the context of disability</p><p>implies calling for several forms of governmental action or intervention.</p><p>(i) Equality of opportunity entails tackling structural exclusion in such areas as</p><p>transport, social amenities, public services and communications. No</p><p>meaningful change is conceivable unless the social and economic processes of</p><p>civil society are structured more inclusively and opened up to persons with</p><p>disabilities on a genuinely equal basis. Such changes necessarily take time but</p><p>the main thing is to inaugurate an irreversible process of structural change</p><p>with clear goals and timetables.</p><p>(ii) Equality of o</p></div></div>

Persons <em>hors de combat </em>and those who do not take a direct part in hostilities are entitled to respect for</p><p>their</p><p>lives and their moral and physical integrity. They shall in all circumstances be protected and treated</p><p>humanely</p><p>without any adverse distinction.</p><p>2.

The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for by the party to the conflict which has them in its</p><p>power.</p><p>Protection also covers medical personnel, establishments, transports and equipment. The emblem of the red</p><p>cross or the red crescent is the sign of such protection and must be respected.</p><p>4. Captured combatants and civilians under the authority of an adverse party are entitled to respect for their</p><p>lives,dignity, personal rights and convictions.

Field of application, duration of application, general principles of law</strong></p><p>The Conventions and the Protocol are applicable in case of declared war or of any other armed conflict</p><p>arising between two or more of the Parties to the Conventions and Protocol I from the beginning of such a</p><p>situation, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. These agreements also cover armed</p><p>conflicts in which people are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist</p><p>regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination.[I, 2; II, 2; III, 2; IV, 2; P. I, 1]</p><p>The application ceases at the general close of military operations and, in occupied territories, at the end of</p><p>the occupation except for those categories of people whose final release, repatriation or settlement takes</p><p>place at a later date. These people shall continue to benefit from the relevant provisions of the Conventions</p><p>and the Protocol until their final release, repatriation or settlement. [I, 5; III, 5; IV, 6; P. I, 3]</p><p>In cases not covered by the Conventions, the Protocol or other international agreements, or in the case of</p><p>denunciation of these agreements, <em>civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of</em></p><p><em>the principles of international law derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and</em></p><p><em>from the dictates of public conscience.</em>[P. I, 1 ; I, 63; II, 62; III, 142; IV, 158]</p><p><strong>2. Prohibition of reprisals</strong></p><p>Reprisals, violations of the law in response to other violations of the law and to make them cease, are</p><p>prohibited against the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, medical services and personnel, civil defence</p><p>services and personnel, prisoners of war, civilians, civilian and cultural property, the natural environment</p><p>and works and installations containing dangerous forces. They are admitted only in the conduct of the</p><p>hostilities.[I, 46; II, 47; III, 13; IV, 33; P. I, 20, 51-56]</p><p><strong>3. Non-renunciation of rights</strong></p><p>The Geneva Conventions having as their aim the protection of war victims, these persons must be placed,</p><p>as far as is possible, out of the reach of any pressures to make them renounce their rights. This is why</p><p>these persons may in no circumstances renounce, in part or totally, the rights ensured them by the</p><p>Conventions and the Protocol. The people mainly concerned are military and civilian medical personnel and</p><p>the wounded, military and civilian sick and shipwrecked persons, as well as prisoners of war, civilian</p><p>internees, inhabitants of occupied territories and foreigners on the territory of a Party to the conflict. The</p><p><strong>Extract from “Basic rules of the </strong><strong>Geneva</strong><strong> Conventions and their Additional Protocols”</strong></p><p>Provisions common to the four Conventions and to Protocol I</p><p>Page 2 of 3</p><p>principle of non-renunciation applies to all the rights which protect war victims.[I, 7; II, 7; III, 7; IV, 8; P.</p><p>I, 1]</p><p><strong>4. Supervision</strong></p><p><strong>a) Protecting Powers</strong></p><p>To ensure that the Geneva Conventions are respected, the Parties to the conflict should secure the</p><p>cooperation</p><p>and admit the supervision of Protecting Powers, in other words neutral States appointed to safeguard the</p><p>interests</p><p>of the Parties to the conflict in enemy countries. If such appointments have not been made, the</p><p>International</p><p>Committee of the Red Cross will offer the Parties to the conflict its help in the designation of Protecting</p><p>Powers.[I,</p><p>8; II, 8; III, 8; IV, 9; P. I, 5]</p><p><strong>b) International Committee of the Red Cross</strong></p><p>The presence of the Protecting Powers does not stand in the way of humanitarian activities which the ICRC</p><p>or any other impartial humanitarian organization undertakes for the protection of war victims.[I, 9; II, 9;</p><p>III, 9; IV, 10]</p><p>This is an application of the provision that governments may at any time agree to entrust to an organization</p><p>offering every guarantee of impartiality and efficiency the humanitarian duties incumbent on the Protecting</p><p>Powers by virtue of the Conventions.[I, 10; II, 10; III, 10; IV, 11]</p><p>ICRC delegates are, in particular, authorized to go to all places where there are protected persons, prisoners</p><p>of war or civil internees and to talk to them without witnesses. The ICRC will be granted all the necessary</p><p>facilities to carry out its humanitarian work.[III, 126; IV, 143; P. I, 81]</p><p><strong>5. Sanctions</strong></p><p>These articles have particular significance. They relate both to offences which are subject only to</p><p>administrative or disciplinary sanctions as well as to grave breaches, against which they constitute an</p><p>embryonic international penal law by elevating them to the rank of international crimes and designating</p><p>them as “war crimes”. These articles lay before the conscience of the world the list of especially grave</p><p>violations of the Conventions and the Protocol which, were they to remain unpunished, would signify the</p><p>degradation of human values and the regression of the entire concept of humanity.</p><p>These <em>grave breaches </em>are those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or</p><p>property protected by the Conventions, as supplemented by the Protocol: wilful killing, torture or inhuman</p><p>treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or</p><p>health, any wilful omission seriously endangering the physical or mental health or integrity of a person in</p><p>the power of a Party other than the one on which he depends, unlawful deportation or transfer, illegal</p><p>detention, compelling a protected person to serve in the armed forces of a hostile Power, or wilfully</p><p>depriving a protected person of the right to a fair and regular trial as prescribed in the Conventions and the</p><p>Protocol, the taking of hostages, the destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military</p><p>necessity and carried out on a large scale in an arbitrary and unlawful way.[I, 50; II, 51; III, 130; IV, 174;</p><p>P. I, 11]</p><p>The following wilful acts are also grave breaches when they result in death or cause serious injury to body</p><p>or health: attacks on the civilian population, civilians, civilian property, attacks launched indiscriminately or</p><p>attacks on works and installations containing dangerous forces, in the knowledge that such attacks will</p><p>cause loss of lives, injury to civilians or damage to civilian property which are excessive in relation to the</p><p>actual and direct military advantage expected; attacks on non-defended localities and demilitarized zones,</p><p>attacks on people known to be <em>hors de combat </em>and the perfidious use of the emblem of the red cross or red</p><p>crescent and other recognized protective signs.</p><p>The following are also grave breaches of the Conventions and the Protocol: any transfer by an Occupying</p><p>Power of part of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, the deportation or transfer of all or</p><p>Provisions common to the four Conventions and to Protocol I</p><p>Page 3 of 3</p><p>part of the population of this territory, any unjustifiable delay in the repatriation of prisoners of war or</p><p>civilians, apartheid and similar practices, attacks directed against clearly recognizable historical monuments,</p><p>works of art or places of worship.</p><p>The Conventions and the Protocol require governments to enact any legislation necessary to provide</p><p>effective penal sanctions for persons committing or ordering the commission of any of the grave breaches;</p><p>they will search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered the commission of such</p><p>breaches, including those resulting from a failure to act when under a duty to do so. Military commanders</p><p>must be watchful to prevent breaches of the Conventions and the Protocol, will suppress them and, if</p><p>necessary, report them to the competent authorities.[I, 49; II, 50; III, 129; IV, 146]</p><p>As we have seen, each contracting Party must also take the necessary steps to stop actions contrary to the</p><p>Conventions other than grave breaches. But the Conventions accord the greatest importance to grave</p><p>breaches because they provide for them to come under the criminal jurisdiction of all Parties to the</p><p>Conventions. It is also possible for the offender to be brought before an international tribunal, if such a</p><p>tribunal has been set up.</p><p>Because of the universality of such sanctions, extradition will be required whenever a State concerned has</p><p>not summoned the accused to appear before its own courts. Being subject to so many different forms of</p><p>possible jurisdiction, these crimes are not likely to go unpunished.</p><p><strong>6. Dissemination</strong></p><p>In time of peace as in time of war, the Parties are obliged to include the study of the Conventions and the</p><p>Protocol in their programmes of military instruction and to encourage the civilian population to study them.</p><p>Military and civil authorities must be fully acquainted with these texts and military commanders must ensure</p><p>that members of the armed forces under their command are aware of their obligations under the</p><p>Conventions and the Protocol.[I, 47; II, 48; III, 127; IV, 144; P. I, 83, 87]</p><p>In addition, Parties to a conflict are obliged to ensure that legal advisers are available to advise military</p><p>commanders on the application of the Conventions and the Protocol and on appropriate instructions to the</p><p>armed forces on this subject.[P. I, 82]</p><p>31-12-1988</p><p>Protection of the wounded, sick and shipwrecked</p><p>Page 1 of 4</p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross</p><p><strong>31-12-1988</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Protection of the wounded, sick and shipwrecked</strong></p><p><strong>Geneva Convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field</strong></p><p>(Convention I of 12 August 1949)</p><p><strong>Geneva Convention for the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of</strong></p><p><strong>armed forces at sea </strong>(Convention II of 12 August 1949)</p><p><strong>Additional Protocol I, Part II</strong></p><p>1.

Field of application of the two Conventions and the Protocol</strong></p><p>Generally speaking, the Second Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 is almost identical with the First. The</p><p>main difference between the two is that the second concerns the wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of</p><p>armed forces at sea while the first relates to the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field. Otherwise, the</p><p>principles underlying the two Conventions are identical and the same rules apply to protected persons and</p><p>property, taking into account the different conditions prevailing on land and at sea.[I, 13; II, 13]</p><p>Protocol I, Part 11, extends this protection to all wounded, sick and shipwrecked persons, whether they be</p><p>civilians or members of the armed forces.[P. I, 8, 34]</p><p><strong>2.

When this information is not channelled through the ICRC and its central Agency,</p><p>each Party to the conflict will ensure that this information is also supplied to the Central Agency provided for in</p><p>Convention III. [I, 16; II, 19; P. I, 33; III, 122; IV, 136]</p><p><strong>6. Role of the civilian population and relief organizations; role of neutral ships</strong></p><p><em>The civilian Population must respect the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, even if they belong to the adverse Party, and</em></p><p><em>shall commit no act of violence against them. </em>The civilian population and relief organizations, such as National Red Cross</p><p>and Red Crescent Societies, will be authorized, even in invaded or occupied regions, to collect and care for the wounded,</p><p>sick and ship wrecked, even if they are enemy parachutists or guerillas. Nobody may be harassed, prosecuted or convicted</p><p>for such humanitarian action.[I, 18; P. I, 17]</p><p>Furthermore, the competent authority may appeal to the civilian population and the relief organizations to collect the</p><p>wounded, sick and shipwrecked, to search for the dead and report where they were found.</p><p>The same applies in naval warfare to neutral merchant vessels, yachts or other craft which may be called upon, by the</p><p>Parties to the conflict, to take on board and care for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked and also to collect the dead.[II,</p><p>21]</p><p><strong>7. Medical units</strong></p><p><em>Military(2) or civilian medical units are protected by the Conventions and the Protocol. </em>Such units comprise all buildings or</p><p>fixed installations (hospitals and other similar units, blood transfusion and preventive medicine centres, medical depots</p><p>and stores) and mobile units (quarantine stations, tents, open air installations, vehicles assigned to medical purposes) [I,</p><p>19; P.

Protection may only cease, however, after a warning has been given, setting a reasonable time limit, and</p><p>after such warning has remained unheeded.[I, 21, 22;P, I, 13]</p><p><em>The equipment </em>(stretchers, surgical apparatus, medicines, dressings, etc.) of mobile military units seized by the</p><p>army will be reserved for the care of the wounded and sick.[I, 33]</p><p><em>In occupied territory, </em>the occupant cannot requisition civilian medical units, their equipment, material or personnel</p><p>so long as these resources are required for the needs of the civilian population and the wounded and sick already</p><p>under treatment.[P.

Medical transport</strong></p><p>“Medical transport” means the conveyance by land, water or air of the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, medical</p><p>and religious personnel and medical equipment protected by the Conventions and the Protocol. <em>Any means of</em></p><p><em>transport may be used, whether military or civilian, permanent or temporary, assigned exclusively to this purpose</em></p><p><em>and placed under the control of a Party to the conflict.</em>[P. I, 8]</p><p><em>Medical transport by land </em>(ambulances) must be respected and protected in the same way as mobile medical</p><p>units. Military ambulances falling into enemy hands are subject to the laws of war on condition that the Party</p><p>capturing them assumes responsibility for the sick and wounded they contain.[I, 35; P. I, 21]</p><p><em>Medical transport by water </em>is carried out either by hospital ships or other medical ships and craft. The following</p><p>vessels are protected by the Conventions and the Protocol on condition that their names and descriptions have</p><p>been notified to the Parties to the conflict:[II, 22]</p><p>– military hospital ships of the Parties to the conflict;</p><p>– hospital ships used by National Red Cross Societies or other officially recognized aid Societies or by private</p><p>persons, including those from neutral countries;[II, 24, 25]</p><p>– hospital ships made available to a Party to the conflict by a neutral State or by an impartial international</p><p>organization of a humanitarian nature.[P. I, 22]</p><p>Hospital ships may not be attacked and may not be captured. The same applies to ships chartered for the</p><p>transport of medical equipment. However, the Parties to the conflict have the right to board and inspect these</p><p>ships.[II, 22, 31, 38]</p><p>Any hospital ship in a port which falls into enemy hands will be authorized to leave the port.[II, 29]</p><p>Other medical ships and craft shall be respected and protected in the same way as mobile medical units.[P. I, 23]</p><p><em>Medical transport by air </em>(medical aircraft) carried out in areas not controlled by an adverse Party shall be</p><p>respected and protected. In contact or similar zones, medical aircraft operate at their own risk, unless prior</p><p>agreement has been reached between the Parties concerned. They must, however, be respected, even in the</p><p>absence of such agreement, after they have been recognized as medical aircraft. When flying over an area</p><p>controlled by an adverse Party, protection is subject to the prior agreement of this Party.[P. I, 24, 25, 26, 27]</p><p>Medical aircraft must not be used to attempt to acquire a military advantage over an adverse Party nor, without the</p><p>prior agreement of this Party, to search for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked.[P. I, 28]</p><p>Medical aircraft flying over areas not controlled by the Party to which they belong may be ordered to land or to</p><p>alight on water and must obey such an order. If inspection reveals that the aircraft has not infringed any rule of the</p><p>law of armed conflicts, it must be authorized to continue its flight without delay.[P. I, 30]</p><p><em>Medical aircraft must not fly over the territory of neutral States </em>except by previous agreement or in an emergency.</p><p>In the latter case, the medical aircraft will make every effort to identify itself and the neutral State will refrain from</p><p>attacking it as soon as it has recognized it as such. If wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons are collected or</p><p>disembarked on neutral territory, they will be cared for and detained by this State if they belong to the fighting</p><p>armed forces of a Party to the conflict, so that they cannot again take part in the hostilities.[II, 40; P. I, 31]</p><p><strong>9. Medical personnel</strong></p><p><em>Medical and religious personnel of the Parties to the conflict, whether military or civilian, shall be respected and</em></p><p><em>protected.</em>[I, 24, 25; P, I, 15]</p><p>Such personnel (doctors, nurses, stretcher-bearers, etc.) should be assigned, either on a permanent or</p><p>temporary basis, exclusively to medical purposes (see Point 7, Medical Units) or to the administration and</p><p>operation of medical units or medical transport facilities (administrators, drivers, cooks, etc.). Religious personnel</p><p>comprise military or civilian persons, such as chaplains, who are exclusively engaged in the work of their ministry.</p><p>Medical and religious personnel benefit from special protection and are designated as “protected personnel”.(3) [I,</p><p>24, 25, 26, 27; II, 36, 42; P. I, 8]</p><p><em>Protected personnel </em>are the following:</p><p><em>a) Military or civilian medical personnel of the Parties to the conflict, including those belonging to civil defence</em></p><p><em>organizations;</em></p><p>b) <em>medical personnel of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and other national aid Societies</em></p><p><em>recognized by a Party to the conflict;</em></p><p>Protection of the wounded, sick and shipwrecked</p><p>Page 4 of 4</p><p>c) <em>religious personnel attached, either permanently or temporarily, to the armed forces, to medical units or</em></p><p><em>transport, or to civil defence organizations.</em></p><p>If military medical personnel fall into enemy hands, they may be retained so as to care for prisoners of war. They will not</p><p>themselves be regarded as prisoners of war. They will nevertheless benefit at least from all the provisions of the Geneva</p><p>Convention of 12 August 1949 relative to the treatment of prisoners of war.[I, 28; II, 37; III, 33]</p><p><em>In occupied territory, </em>civilian medical personnel may not be requisitioned if their services are necessary to provide for the</p><p>medical needs of the civilian population and the care of the wounded and sick already under treatment.[P. I, 14]</p><p><strong>10. Medical mission</strong></p><p>Finally, the Protocol provides that nobody may be punished for having carried out medical activities compatible with</p><p>medical ethics, regardless of the beneficiaries of this activity, nor be compelled to carry out acts contrary to the rules of</p><p>medical ethics or to refrain from carrying out acts required by these rules.[P. I, 16]</p><p><strong>11. Emblem and signals</strong></p><p>The sign of the red cross(4) or red crescent must be displayed on the flags, buildings, installations and mobile formations</p><p>of medical units, on their means of transport, as well as on armlets, clothes and headgear of medical and religious</p><p>personnel. It will be as large as the circumstances require.[I, 39; P. I, 18]</p><p>An important regulation: the distinctive emblem of the Convention and the Protocol <em>may be displayed only on medical</em></p><p><em>units and by medical personnel protected by the Convention and the Protocol, and only with the consent of the competent</em></p><p><em>authority. </em>Strict observance of this rule is essential to respect the Convention the Protocol.[I, 42; P. II, 18]</p><p>In naval warfare, ships and craft entitled to the protection the Convention will be marked as follows:[II, 43]</p><p>a) <em>all exterior surfaces must be white,.</em></p><p><em>b) one or more dark red crosses, as large as possible, must painted on each side of the hull as well as on</em></p><p><em>horizontal surfaces, so as to afford the greatest possible visibility from the sea and from the air. A white flag with a</em></p><p><em>red cross shall be flown at the mainmast, as high as possible.</em></p><p><em>The international Red Cross organizations and their duly authorized personnel are permitted to use the emblem of the red</em></p><p><em>cross on a white ground at all times.</em>[I, 44]</p><p>Apart from these regulations, the use of the emblem or the designation “red cross” or “Geneva cross”, or any sign or</p><p>designation constituting an imitation, shall be prohibited at all times; the necessary measures will be taken to prevent and</p><p>repress any abuse of these distinctive signs. The perfidious use of the emblem of the red cross (and other protective signs</p><p>or signals) is a grave breach.[I, 53, 54; II, 45; P. I, 18, 85]</p><p>In addition to the distinctive emblem, the Parties to the conflict may authorize the use of distinctive signals (light, radio</p><p>and secondary radar signals, internationally recognized codes and signals).[P. I, 18 and Annex I]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>1. For protected medical personnel, see point 9.</p><p>2. As far as Possible, military medical units and especially civilian medical units should be placed</p><p>well out of the way of military objectives.</p><p>3. Protected personnel must carry identity cards and make themselves known by means of the</p><p>distinctive emblem of the red cross or red crescent (1, 40, 41; 11, 42; P. 1, 18 and Annex 1, Chapter I</p><p>and II). They may be armed for their own defence and that of the wounded in their charge (I, 22; II, 35; P. 1, 13).</p><p>4. The form of the cross is not specified but it has become customary to use a so-called Greek cross, i.e. a cross with four</p><p>arms of equal length not touching the edge of the shield, comprising the inverted colours of the Swiss flag. Instead of the</p><p>red cross, some countries use the red crescent. The red lionand-sun emblem is no longer in use.</p><p>31-12-1988</p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 1 of 9</p><p>International Committee of the Red Cross</p><p><strong>31-12-1988</strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of</strong></p><p><strong>prisoners of war</strong></p><p><strong>Geneva Convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war </strong>(Convention III of 12 August 1949)</p><p><strong>Additional Protocol I, Part II</strong></p><p><strong>Contents:</strong></p><p><strong>Section I</strong></p><p>Status</p><p><strong>Section II</strong></p><p>Regulations relating to the conduct of combatants</p><p><strong>Section III</strong></p><p>Protection of prisoners of war</p><p>1.

The general principle is the following: <em>any member of the armed forces of a Party to a conflict</em></p><p><em>is a</em></p><p><em>combatant and any combatant captured by the adverse Party is a prisoner of war.</em>[III, 4; P. I, 43, 44]</p><p>This general rule is supplemented by three types of provisions which specify the conditions in which armed</p><p>forces are recognized as such, to extend the qualification (or the treatment) of prisoner of war to categories</p><p>of persons not covered by the general rule, and finally to deprive, in a specific case, a captured combatant</p><p>of his qualification as a combatant and hence of his status of prisoner of war.</p><p><strong>Extract from “Basic rules of the </strong><strong>Geneva</strong><strong> Conventions and their Additional Protocols”</strong></p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 2 of 9</p><p>a) <em>To be recognized as such, the armed forces of a Party to a conflict must be organized and placed under a</em></p><p><em>command responsible to that Party for the conduct of its subordinates, even if that Party is represented by</em></p><p><em>a government or other authority not recognized by the adverse Party. In addition, these armed forces must</em></p><p><em>be subject to an internal disciplinary system which, </em>inter alia, <em>enforces compliance with the rules of</em></p><p><em>internationallaw applicable in armed conflicts. In particular, this compliance requires combatants to</em></p><p><em>distinguish themselves from civilians, except in particular circumstances (see point c below) by a uniform or</em></p><p><em>other distinctive sign, visible and recognizable at a distance, while they are engaged in an attack or in a</em></p><p><em>military operation preparatory to an attack. Violation by a combatant of the rules applicable in armed</em></p><p><em>conflict is punishable but if this combatant at least carries his arms openly during the engagement, he is not</em></p><p><em>deprived of his right to the status of prisoner of war in case of capture. If the Party to which these armed</em></p><p><em>forces belong omits or deliberately refuses to enforce compliance with these rules, it can result in all</em></p><p><em>members of these forces losing their status of combatant and prisoner of war</em>. (1)</p><p><em>b) The status or treatment of prisoner of war is </em>extended to <em>various categories of persons who do not come</em></p><p><em>under</em></p><p><em>the definition of combatants as given below, or who are not combatants. The following are thus also entitled</em></p><p><em>to the</em></p><p><em>status </em>of <em>prisoner of war:</em></p><p>– those taking part in a levy en masse, that is, when the inhabitants of a non-occupied territory</p><p>spontaneously take</p><p>up arms on the approach of the enemy to combat invasion without having had time to organize themselves</p><p>as laid down under point a) above, if they carry their arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war;</p><p>-persons authorized to follow the armed forces without being directly part of them;</p><p>-crews of the merchant marine and civil aviation;</p><p>-members of military personnel serving in civil defence organizations.[P. I, 67]</p><p>The following are entitled only to the <em>treatment </em>of prisoner of war:</p><p>– persons arrested in occupied territory because they belong to the armed forces of the occupied country;</p><p>– military internees in a neutral country;</p><p>– members of non-combatant medical and religious personnel who are part of the armed forces.</p><p>c) <em>In exceptional cases, when required by the nature of the hostilities, a combatant can be released from</em></p><p><em>the</em></p><p><em>obligation to distinguish himself from the civilian population by wearing a uniform or distinctive sign</em></p><p><em>recognizable at</em></p><p><em>a distance during military operations. However, in such situations, these combatants must distinguish</em></p><p><em>themselves</em></p><p><em>by carrying arms openly during the engagement and during such time as they are visible to the adversary</em></p><p><em>while</em></p><p><em>engaged in a military deployment preceding the launching of an attack in which they are to participate. Even</em></p><p><em>failing</em></p><p><em>to comply with the obligation of carrying arms openly can deprive a combatant of his status, but not of the</em></p><p><em>guarantees relating to it, in the case of his being prosecuted for carrying arms illegally either with or</em></p><p><em>without other</em></p><p><em>offences. </em>(2)</p><p>These provisions are not intended to modify the generally accepted practice of uniforms being worn by</p><p>members of regular armed units of the Parties to conflicts.</p><p>To avoid uncertainty and prevent any arbitrary measures at the time of capture, the Protocol specifies that</p><p>any person taking part in hostilities and captured is presumed to be a prisoner of war and is treated as a</p><p>prisoner of war, <em>even in case of doubt </em>as to his status. In the latter case, the question will be decided by a</p><p>tribunal at a later date. A person who, having taken part in hostilities, is eventually deprived of his right to</p><p>the status of prisoner of war, benefits not only from the provisions of the Fourth Convention applicable in his</p><p>case but also from the fundamental guarantees laid down in article 75 of the Protocol (see Section Ill, point</p><p>6 at end, below page 31).[III, 5; P. I, 45]</p><p><em>Spies and mercenaries </em>are not entitled to the status of prisoner of war. <em>Children </em>under the age of fifteen</p><p>shall not be recruited into the armed forces.(3) [P. I, 46, 47]</p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 3 of 9</p><p><em>Children </em>under the age of fifteen shall not be recruited into the armed forces.[P. I, 77]</p><p><strong>Section II</strong></p><p><strong>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants</strong></p><p>Part III of the Protocol does not confine itself to stating the rules relating to the status and treatment of</p><p>prisoners of war. It also recalls the correct conduct of combatants in the course of hostilities. The</p><p>fundamental principle forming the basis of these rules is that <em>the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose</em></p><p><em>methods or means of warfare is not unlimited.</em>[P. I, 35]</p><p>For example, it is prohibited to employ weapons, projectiles and methods and materials of warfare of a</p><p>nature to cause superfluous injury, particularly those which are intended to cause, or can be expected to</p><p>cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. Neither may the presence of</p><p>civilian persons be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.[P. I, 51; IV, 28]</p><p><em>It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. </em>Acts inviting the confidence of an</p><p>adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to receive, or is obliged to accord protection under the</p><p>rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute</p><p>perfidy. The recognized emblems (the white flag, the emblem of cultural property, other recognized</p><p>protective signs) and in particular the sign of the red cross or red crescent must not be used improperly.</p><p>The use of the national insignia of States not Parties to the conflict is forbidden. The national insignia of the</p><p>adverse Party must not be used during attacks or in order to shield, favour, protect or impede military</p><p>operations.[P. I, 37; P. I, 38; P, I, 39]</p><p>The Protocol thus asserts that the law of armed conflicts demands a minimum of honesty on the part of the</p><p>combatants. Other rules of conduct of combatants are summarized either in Section I of this chapter or in</p><p>the relevant chapters of this manual (see in particular Chapter 1, points 2 and 5, Chapter 11, points 3-4 and</p><p>7-11 and Chapter IV, Section 1). But it should be stressed here, once again, that it is prohibited to declare</p><p>that no <em>quarter </em>will be given, to threaten the adversary with this and to conduct hostilities in such a way</p><p>that there are no survivors. The enemy who is hors de combat, or who has surrendered, or who shows his</p><p>intention to surrender, or who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress, shall not be made the object of</p><p>attack. If the capturing Party is unable to evacuate its prisoners from the fighting zone, it must release</p><p>them and take all feasible precautions to ensure their safety.[P. I, 40, 41, 42]</p><p><strong>Section III</strong></p><p><strong>Protection of prisoners of war</strong></p><p><strong>1. Rights and obligations</strong></p><p>Regarding the rights of prisoners of war, the principle specifying that prisoners of war are in the hands of</p><p>the enemy Power, but not of the individuals or military units who have captured them, should be borne in</p><p>mind. Prisoners of war are entitled in all circumstances to respect for their persons and their honour. [III,</p><p>12, 14]</p><p>Women must be treated with all the regard due to their sex and shall in all cases benefit from treatment at</p><p>least as favourable as that granted to men. Finally, it should be noted that prisoners of war retain the full</p><p>civil capacity they had at the time of their capture. Within the limits imposed by captivity, they therefore</p><p>continue to enjoy their civil rights according to the law of their country of origin. In particular, they can</p><p>marry by proxy.[III, 14]</p><p>As for the duties of prisoners, they are generally derived from the laws of war and the rules of military</p><p>discipline.</p><p>Some of these duties are formally stated in the Convention; thus article 17, relating to <em>questioning </em>of the</p><p>prisoner, specifies that he is bound to give his name, first names and rank, date of birth and army,</p><p>regimental, personal or serial number or, failing this, equivalent information.(4) However, the same article</p><p>adds that no physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion may be inflicted on prisoners of war</p><p>to obtain from them information of any kind whatever.[III, 17]</p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 4 of 9</p><p>The Convention also provides for the case – which is not excluded, if the laws of the Power on which</p><p>prisoners depend allow it – for the <em>release on parole </em>or promise. Article 21 states that prisoners released</p><p>under these conditions will be bound, on their personal honour, scrupulously to fulfil, both towards the</p><p>Power on which they depend and the Power which has captured them, the engagements of their paroles or</p><p>promises.[III, 21]</p><p>This mention is important for it shows that honesty is essential to the successful application of humanitarian</p><p>rules.</p><p><strong>2. Protection and treatment</strong></p><p>The Protocol prohibits declaring that no quarter will be given, threatening the adversary with this, and</p><p>conducting hostilities in such a way that there are no survivors. The enemy who is hors de combat, who has</p><p>surrendered or who shows his intention of surrendering, or who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress</p><p>shall not be the object of attack.[P. I, 40, 41, 42]</p><p>In these articles, the Convention states that <em>prisoners of war must at all times be treated humanely </em>and</p><p>that subject to any privileged treatment on account of rank, sex, state of health, age or professional</p><p>qualifications, all prisoners of war shall be treated alike. The Protocol specifies that no prisoner may be</p><p>subjected to physical mutilation or to medical and scientific experiments of any nature whatever, which are</p><p>not justified by the medical treatment of the prisoner concerned and which are not in his interest. It</p><p>nevertheless allows for exceptions in the case of donations of blood for transfusion or of skin for grafting,</p><p>providing that these are voluntary.[III, 13, 16; P. I, 11]</p><p>Among the <em>general principles </em>protecting prisoners of war, the following should also be mentioned: they shall</p><p>not be unnecessarily exposed to danger while awaiting evacuation from a fighting zone. When they have</p><p>been captured under unusual conditions of combat which prevent their being evacuated in the normal way,</p><p>they shall be released and all feasible precautions shall be taken to ensure their safety.[III, 19; P. I, 41]</p><p>Prisoners of war may be interned only in premises located on land and affording every guarantee of hygiene</p><p>and wholesomeness. No prisoner of war may at any time be sent to or detained in an area where he may be</p><p>exposed to the fire of the combat zone, nor may his presence be used to render certain points or areas</p><p>immune from military operations.[III, 22,23]</p><p><em>Prisoners without the recognized status of prisoner of war are at all times entitled to the fundamental</em></p><p><em>guarantees (see Chapter </em>IV, Section II, Point 2, letter g, page 43 and point 6 below, guarantees of judicial</p><p>procedure).</p><p><strong>3. Physical conditions of internment</strong></p><p>The Detaining Power assumes general responsibility for the life and welfare of prisoners of war, who must be</p><p>kept in good health. Women and children under the age of fifteen becoming prisoners of war must be</p><p>treated with special respect and protected against any form of indecent assault. Other information</p><p>concerning the application of these principles can be found under the following headings: [P. I 76, 77]</p><p><strong>Quarters </strong>[III, 25]</p><p><strong>Food </strong>[III, 26, 28]</p><p><strong>Clothing </strong>[III, 27]</p><p><strong>Hygiene and medical attention </strong>[III, 29, 30, 31]</p><p>Under all circumstances, prisoners of war will receive any medical care they may need and will preferably be</p><p>treated by medical personnel of the Power on which they depend and, if possible, of their nationality.</p><p><strong>Transfers </strong>[III, 12, 46, 48]</p><p>Prisoners of war may only be transferred to a Power which is a party to the Convention and after the</p><p>Detaining Power has satisfied itself that the Power in question is willing and able to apply the Convention.</p><p>Transfer within the territory of the Detaining Power will always be carried out humanely and in conditions no</p><p>less favourable than those enjoyed by the troops of the Detaining Power during their movements.</p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 5 of 9</p><p><strong>4. Moral and psychological conditions of internment</strong></p><p>The Convention is not only concerned with the physical conditions of internment. A great number of articles</p><p>are devoted to moral and psychological conditions. They deal not only with religion, intellectual and sports</p><p>activities but also with the kind of work considered suitable to maintain prisoners’ self-respect and mental</p><p>well-being and protect them from boredom and idleness. In application of these principles, the Convention</p><p>includes a number of provisions on the following matters:</p><p><strong>Religion </strong>[III, 34, 35]</p><p><strong>Intellectual and sports activities </strong>[III, 38]</p><p><strong>Work </strong>[III, 49, 50, 51, 57]</p><p>In order to prevent the work carried out by prisoners from degenerating into inhumane exploitation or</p><p>participation in the war effort of the Detaining Power, such work is limited by a series of very strict rules.</p><p><strong>Property and working pay </strong>[III, 18, 28, 59, 60, 61, 62]</p><p><strong>Correspondence </strong>[III, 71, 74, 76]</p><p>Prisoners of war shall be allowed to send and receive letters and cards free of postage.(5)</p><p><strong>5. Aid</strong></p><p>The Convention affirms the right of prisoners of war to receive relief.</p><p>Relief supplies may be individual or collective but the Convention indicates a preference to relief parcels of a</p><p>standard model, intended for all the prisoners in a camp and shared out among them by prisoners’</p><p>representatives.(6) [III, 72]</p><p>All relief shipments are exempt from import, customs and other dues and the experience acquired by the</p><p>ICRC and National Red Cross Societies in the course of the two World Wars is implicitly recognized.[III, 74,</p><p>75]</p><p><strong>6. Discipline</strong></p><p><strong>a) General observations</strong></p><p>To ensure discipline in accordance with military honour, every prisoner of war camp is placed under the</p><p>immediate authority responsible commissioned officer belonging to the regular at forces of the Detaining</p><p>Power.[III, 39]</p><p>This officer must be fully acquainted with the <em>text of the Convention </em>and the relevant provisions of the</p><p>Protocol. These texts must also be posted in each camp, in the prisoners’ own language, in places where all</p><p>may read them. The wearing of badges of rank and nationality, as well as decorations, shall be permitted, in</p><p>due respect for the dignity of the persons concerned.[III, 41; P. I, 83; III, 40]</p><p>Military commanders must ensure that members of the armed forces under their command are aware of</p><p>their obligations under the Conventions and the Protocol. They are responsible for preventing any breaches</p><p>of these provisions, for suppressing them and, if necessary, reporting them to the competent authorities.[P.</p><p>I, 87]</p><p><strong>b) Escapes or attempts to escape</strong></p><p>The Convention has several provisions relating to escapes or attempts to escape. These are accepted as</p><p>being consistent with military honour and patriotic courage. Punishments incurred in cases of escape are</p><p>consequently limited. Weapons may be used against prisoners who escape or attempt to escape, but such</p><p>use should only be made as a last resort and must always be preceded by warnings appropriate to the</p><p>circumstances.[III, 91, 92, 93; III, 42]</p><p><strong>c) Prisoners’ representatives</strong></p><p>Article 79 stipulates that in all places where there are prisoners of war, except in those where there are</p><p>officers, the prisoners shall freely elect by secret ballot, every six months, and in case of vacancies,</p><p>representatives entrusted with representing them before the military authorities, the Protecting Powers, the</p><p>ICRC and any other organization which may assist them. These prisoners’ representatives shall be eligible</p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 6 of 9</p><p>for re-election. In camps for officers and persons of equivalent status or in mixed camps, the senior-ranking</p><p>officer among the prisoners of war shall be recognized as the camp prisoners’ representative.[III, 79]</p><p>This institution is very important. Benefiting from various prerogatives and facilities enumerated in article</p><p>81, the prisoners’ representative is the intermediary qualified to further the physical, spiritual and</p><p>intellectual well-being of prisoners of war.[III, 80, 81]</p><p>He not only supervises the <em>distribution of relief supplies </em>but also does all he can to mitigate the severities of</p><p>discipline, to <em>help prisoners </em>in their difficulties with the detaining authority.</p><p>Finally, it should be stressed that prisoners must have the unrestricted right to apply to the representatives</p><p>of the Protecting Powers, either through their prisoners’ representative or, if they consider it necessary,</p><p>direct, in order to draw their attention to any points on which they may have complaints about their</p><p>conditions of captivity.[III, 78]</p><p><strong>d) Sanctions</strong></p><p>The Convention specifies that <em>prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in</em></p><p><em>the armed forces of the Detaining Power.</em>[III, 82]</p><p>A general leniency clause protects prisoners of war against excessively severe interpretation of the laws and</p><p>regulations. In deciding whether an offence committed by a prisoner of war should be subject to disciplinary</p><p>or judicial punishment, the Detaining Power shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise the</p><p>greatest leniency and adopt, wherever possible, disciplinary rather than judicial measures.[III, 83]</p><p><em>Disciplinary sanctions </em>may only be ordered by the camp commander or an officer appointed by him, and in</p><p>no case by a prisoner of war. Moreover, certain concessions are granted to prisoners undergoing disciplinary</p><p>punishment: permission to take exercise and to be in the open air for at least two hours daily, permission to</p><p>read and write, as well as to send and receive letters.[III, 96, 98]</p><p>Finally, in no case shall disciplinary punishments be inhuman, brutal or dangerous to the health of prisoners</p><p>of war and the duration of any single punishment shall never exceed thirty days.[III, 89, 90]</p><p>As far as <em>judicial sanctions </em>are concerned, a prisoner of war may only be tried by a military court, except</p><p>under specified circumstances. Furthermore, prisoners of war may not be sentenced to any penalties other</p><p>than those imposed for the same acts committed by members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power.</p><p>Collective punishment for individual acts is forbidden, as are corporal punishment, imprisonment in premises</p><p>without daylight and, in general, torture or cruelty in any form whatsoever.[III, 84, 87]</p><p>It is important to note that prisoners who are prosecuted shall still benefit from the Convention, even if they</p><p>are convicted.[III,85]</p><p><em>The death penalty </em>can be imposed, in principle, for offences liable to capital punishment in the armed forces</p><p>of the Detaining Power. Since the accused is not a national of the Detaining Power, owes it no allegiance,</p><p>and is in its power as a result of circumstances beyond his control, the court must take these facts into</p><p>account before pronouncing a death sentence.[III, 100]</p><p>As far as possible, the death penalty shall not be pronounced on pregnant women or mothers having</p><p>dependent infants. If it is pronounced, it will not be carried out. The same will apply to prisoners under the</p><p>age of eighteen at the time the offence was committed.[P. I, 76; P. I, 77]</p><p>Article 101 extends to at least six months the <em>period that must elapse </em>between the time the death penalty</p><p>is pronounced and the time the sentence is executed. Furthermore, Article 107 provides an opportunity for</p><p>the Protecting Power to intervene in the case of a death sentence being pronounced.[III, 101, 107]</p><p><em>The guarantees of judicial procedure form part of the fundamental guarantees, which means that they must</em></p><p><em>be accorded even to prisoners whose status of prisoner of war is not recognized.</em></p><p><em>Judicial procedure must be regular, i.e. it must include at least the following guarantees: the accused to be</em></p><p><em>informed without delay of the particulars of the offence he is alleged to have committed, which must have</em></p><p><em>constituted an offence at the time it was committed; presumption of innocence; no coercion on a prisoner to</em></p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 7 of 9</p><p><em>force him to confess judgement to be pronounced in the presence of the accused and, in principle, publicly.</em></p><p><em>The prisoner cannot be punished more than once for the same act or on the same charge if it is based on</em></p><p><em>the same law and the same judicial procedure.</em>[III, 86, 99; P. I, 75]</p><p><em>The rights of defence are recognized and guaranteed </em>and, accordingly, the prisoner of war shall be entitled</p><p>to be assisted by one of his fellow prisoners, to be defended by a qualified attorney of his own choice, to</p><p>call witnesses and, if he thinks it necessary, to employ the services of a competent interpreter. On the same</p><p>conditions as members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power, he will have the right of appeal with a</p><p>view to quashing or revising the sentence pronounced on him; any judgement and sentence shall be</p><p>immediately reported to the Protecting Power.[III, 105,106; P. I, 75]</p><p><strong>7. Repatriation</strong></p><p><strong>a) Direct repatriation and hospitalization in a neutral country</strong></p><p>Even during hostilities, the Convention prescribes the direct return to their own countries of the wounded</p><p>and sick</p><p>whose mental or physical fitness seems to have been seriously impaired, and hospitalization in neutral</p><p>countries of</p><p>specific categories of those less seriously sick or wounded.[III, 109]</p><p>A model agreement, annexed to Convention 111 (Annex 1, referred to in Article I 10) cites numerous cases</p><p>which</p><p>can give rise to application of this principle. <em>Mixed Medical Commissions, set </em>up at the outbreak of</p><p>hostilities, are</p><p>called upon to decide what prisoners are to be repatriated. The Parties to the conflict must send back to</p><p>their own</p><p>country, regardless of number or rank, seriously wounded and sick prisoners of war, after caring for them</p><p>until they</p><p>are able to travel.[III, 112]</p><p>No sick or injured prisoner of war may be repatriated against his will during hostilities.</p><p>No repatriated person may be employed on active military service.[III, 117]</p><p><strong>b) Release and repatriation at the end of hostilities</strong></p><p>Situations which can arise at the end of a war have shown that the way in which the principle of the Code</p><p>for</p><p>prisoners of war of 1929 was worded, requiring the repatriation of prisoners on the conclusion of peace,</p><p>could be</p><p>detrimental to them, because experience has shown that a very long time can elapse between the time</p><p>hostilities</p><p>cease and the time peace is concluded. To remedy this, the Convention states that <em>repatriation will take</em></p><p><em>place</em></p><p><em>“without delay after the cessation of active hostilities”, </em>i.e. after the cease-fire.[III, 118]</p><p>One exception to immediate repatriation is provided in the case of prisoners convicted or prosecuted for</p><p>criminal</p><p>offences, who may be detained until the end of legal proceedings and, if necessary, until they have</p><p>completed their</p><p>sentences.[III, 119]</p><p><strong>8. Death</strong></p><p>Prisoners of war are entitled to make wills. The Convention prescribes that wills of prisoners of war shall be</p><p>drawn up so as to satisfy the conditions of validity required by legislation in their countries of origin, which</p><p>will take the necessary steps to inform the Detaining Power of its requirements in this respect.[III, 120]</p><p>The Convention specifies the conditions of burial (or, in certain cases cremation) appropriate to ensure</p><p>respect for the dead and to safeguard the interests of their families. The Protocol supplements these</p><p>Rules relating to the conduct of combatants and the protection of prisoners of war</p><p>Page 8 of 9</p><p>provisions.[III, 120; P. I, 35]</p><p>In case of death from suspicious causes, an enquiry is opened in order to determine responsibility,</p><p>particularly with a view to possible compensation for beneficiaries.[III, 121]</p><p>Death certificates must be forwarded as rapidly as possible to the Prisoner of War Information Bureaux.</p><p><strong>9. Information bureaux and Central Tracing Agency</strong></p><p>The services rendered to prisoners and their families by the Central Prisoner of War Agency (now known as</p><p>the Central Tracing Agency) during the two World Wars and the numerous conflicts since 1945 are well</p><p>known.</p><p>Created under the auspices of the ICRC, this Agency keeps in its archives over fifty million cards which</p><p>constitute a unique information system to establish the rights of prisoners or their families. In particular, it</p><p>contains all the information it can obtain through private or official sources concerning prisoners of war with</p><p>a view to determining their identity, and any particulars about them relating to transfers, releases,</p><p>repatriations, escapes, hospitalization and death.</p><p>These results have been consolidated by the Convention, which not only requires Governments to set up</p><p>official bureaux to collect and transmit information about prisoners of war, but provides for establishment of</p><p>a Central Prisoner of War Information Agency in a neutral country.[III, 122, 123; P. I, 34]</p><p>To facilitate the work of the national Bureaux and the Central Information Agency, States must grant them</p><p>free postage for mail, as well as all exemptions provided for in Article 74 and, as far as possible, exemption</p><p>from telegraphic charges or, at least, greatly reduced rates.(7) [III, 124]</p><p>Families have the right to know what has become of their relatives. <em>As soon as circumstances permit and, at</em></p><p><em>the latest, from the end of hostilities, the Parties to the conflict should therefore search for persons reported</em></p><p><em>missing by an adverse Party and transmit all relevant information concerning such persons in order to</em></p><p><em>facilitate the search.</em>[P. I, 33; III, 119]</p><p><strong>10. Assistance by relief societies and the ICRC</strong></p><p>Relief societies, the ICRC and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have played such an important role</p><p>in helping prisoners of war during the two World Wars that the Convention devotes an article to them, to</p><p>facilitate and encourage their activity.</p><p>This provision requires the Powers to grant them and their duly accredited delegates, all the necessary</p><p>facilitates to visit prisoners, distribute relief supplies and material from any source, for religious, educational</p><p>or recreative purposes, and help them organize their leisure activities within camps. The special status of</p><p>the ICRC in this sphere must be recognized and respected.[III, 125]</p><p><strong>11. The right of Protecting Powers and the ICRC to visit</strong></p><p>Furthermore, the Convention provides that representatives of the Protecting Powers shall have permission to</p><p>go to all places where prisoners of war may be, particularly to places of internment, imprisonment and</p><p>labour. </p></div></div>

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS . . . . . . . . . . . . . 246 – 254</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. The Plan of Action (TD/386) adopted by UNCTAD X, in Bangkok in February 2000,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">states in paragraph 152, that: “In close cooperation with other relevant international</p><p style="text-align: justify;">organizations, UNCTAD should continue to undertake studies on the implementation of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">multimodal transport rules.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. To prepare the requested study, the secretariat conducted an inquiry into the existing</p><p style="text-align: justify;">rules and legislation applicable to multimodal transport of goods. A note verbale (dated 14</p><p style="text-align: justify;">April 2000) was sent to all member States of UNCTAD inviting them to provide the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">secretariat with a copy of their national laws/regulations, if any, including other relevant</p><p style="text-align: justify;">information and documentation which may be used in practice. This document attempts to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">provide an overview of the existing laws and regulations governing multimodal transportation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It reflects the information received from Governments in response to the note verbale as well</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as documentation that the secretariat could otherwise obtain from various countries and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">regional or subregional organizations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. In order to provide a clear picture as to the nature and basis of various legislation</p><p style="text-align: justify;">adopted at the national and regional/subregional level, it may be appropriate to provide a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">general background for the subject, including problems associated with present practice as</p><p style="text-align: justify;">well as previous attempts to provide a uniform international legal framework for multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport of goods. As will be seen from the report, the long desired uniformity of law</p><p style="text-align: justify;">governing the international multimodal transport of goods has not yet been achieved. The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">subject still occupies the attention of various international and intergovernmental organizations</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as well as individual Governments. The search for uniformity of law in this important area</p><p style="text-align: justify;">continues and clearly requires treatment in a global forum on a priority basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chapter I</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MULTIMODAL TRANSPORT _ GENERAL OVERVIEW</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A. What is multimodal transport?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. The most authoritative definition of the term “international multimodal transport” is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">provided in article 1 (1) of the United Nations Convention on International Multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Transport of Goods 1980 (hereinafter referred to as the MT Convention) which reads as</p><p style="text-align: justify;">follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“ ‘International multimodal transport’ means the carriage of goods by at least two</p><p style="text-align: justify;">different modes of transport on the basis of a multimodal transport contract from a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">place in one country at which the goods are taken in charge by the multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport operator to a place designated for delivery situated in a different country…”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. This definition should be read in conjunction with the definition of the term</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“multimodal transport operator” (MTO) provided in article 1(2) of the MT Convention, which</p><p style="text-align: justify;">provides:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“ ‘Multimodal transport operator’ means any person who on his own behalf or through</p><p style="text-align: justify;">another person acting on his behalf concludes a multimodal transport contract and who</p><p style="text-align: justify;">acts as a principal, not as an agent or on behalf of the consignor or of the carriers</p><p style="text-align: justify;">participating in the multimodal transport operations, and who assumes responsibility</p><p style="text-align: justify;">for the performance of the contract.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. Thus, the main features of a multimodal transport are: the carriage of goods by two or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">more modes of transport, under one contract, one document and one responsible party (MTO)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">for the entire carriage, who might subcontract the performance of some, or all modes, of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">carriage to other carriers.1 The terms “combined transport” and “intermodal transport” are</p><p style="text-align: justify;">often used interchageably to describe the carriage of goods by two or more modes of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport.2</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B. Background</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">1 The glossary of the terms used in combined transport and related field issued by the United Nations</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE), defines “multimodal transport”as “carriage of goods by two or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">more modes of transport.” The glossary is intended for the work of the three intergovernmental organizations,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">namely the European Community, the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) and the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UN/ECE. It is, however, specified that the “definitions are not applicable in their strictest sense to the legal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and statistical fields, whose relevant documents of reference exist already.” See document:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TRANS/WP.24/2000/1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2 “Intermodal Transport” has been defined as “the movement of goods in one and the same loading</p><p style="text-align: justify;">unit or road vehicle, which uses successively two or more modes of transport without handling the goods</p><p style="text-align: justify;">themselves in changing modes.” “Combined Transport” is defined as “intermodal transport where the major</p><p style="text-align: justify;">part of the European journey is by rail, inland and waterways or sea and any initial or final legs carried out by</p><p style="text-align: justify;">road are as short as possible.” See document TRANS/WP.24/2000/1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7. The development of new transportation techniques, such as containerization and other</p><p style="text-align: justify;">means of unitization of goods in the 1960s, also introduced a significant need for modification</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of commercial and traditional legal approaches to transport. Goods stowed in a container</p><p style="text-align: justify;">could be transported by different means of transport, such as ships, railway wagons, road</p><p style="text-align: justify;">vehicles or aircrafts, from the point of origin to the final place of destination, without being</p><p style="text-align: justify;">unpacked for sorting or verification when being transferred from one means of transport to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">another. Gradually, more and more operators took responsibility for the whole transport chain</p><p style="text-align: justify;">under one single transport contract. Shippers/consignees needed to pursue one single</p><p style="text-align: justify;">operator, in the event of loss of, or damage to, the goods involved in multimodal transport,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">who would be responsible for the overall transport, rather than against several unimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">carriers involved. There was a need for an international legal framework for multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport of goods.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8. In spite of various attempts to establish a uniform legal framework governing multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport3 no such international regime is in force. The MT Convention has failed to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">attract sufficient ratifications to enter into force. The UNCTAD/ICC Rules for Multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Transport Documents, which came into force in January 1992, do not have the force of law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">They are standard contract terms for incorporation into multimodal transport documents. The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">rules, being contractual in nature, will have no effect in the event of conflict with mandatory</p><p style="text-align: justify;">law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9. The lack of a widely acceptable international legal framework on the subject has</p><p style="text-align: justify;">resulted in individual governments and regional/subregional intergovernmental bodies4 taking</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the initiative of enacting legislation in order to overcome the uncertainties and problems which</p><p style="text-align: justify;">presently exist. Concerns have been expressed regarding the proliferation of individual and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">possibly divergent legal approaches which would add to already existing confusion and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">uncertainties pertaining to the legal regime of multimodal transport.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10. A multimodal operation is made up of a number of unimodal stages of transport, such</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as sea, road, rail or air. Each of these is subject to a mandatory international convention or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">national law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C. International conventions applicable to unimodal transportation</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">11. International conventions applicable to unimodal transport include:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transport by sea</strong>:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of Lading, 1924 (Hague Rules);</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Protocol to Amend the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Relating to Bills of Lading 1924, (Hague/Visby Rules) 1968;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3 See paragraphs 16-40.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4 See chapters II and III.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Protocol Amending the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of Law Relating to Bills of Lading, 1924, as Amended by the Protocol of 1968, 1979;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, 1978 (Hamburg Rules).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transport by road:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1956.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transport by rail:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Uniform Rules Concerning the Contract for International Carriage of Goods by Rail</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(CIM), Appendix B to the Convention Concerning International Carriage by Rail</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(COTIF), May 1980.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Protocol to amend CIM-COTIF, 1999.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transport by air:</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Air (Warsaw Convention), 1929;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– The   Hague Protocol, 1955;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– Montreal Protocol No. 4, 1975;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– The Montreal Convention, 1999.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12. The problem which arises is the extent to which these mandatory conventions</p><p style="text-align: justify;">applicable to unimodal transportation would also influence contracts where more than one</p><p style="text-align: justify;">mode of transport is involved,5 bearing in mind that some of these unimodal conventions also</p><p style="text-align: justify;">extend their scope into multimodal transport.6 For example the CMR (article 2), CIM (article</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5 See Ramberg J., UNCTAD/ICC Rules for Multimodal Transport Documents: Origins and Contents,</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Simposio Maritimo: El Transporte Multimodal Internacional y su Impacto en las Actividades del Transporte</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Maritimo</em>. International Chamber of Commerce, Barcelona 2-3 April 1992. See also Mankabady S., The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Multimodal Transport of Goods Convention: A Challenge to Unimodal Transport Conventions, <em>The</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>International and Comparative Law Quarterly</em>, Vol. 32, Part I, January 1983: 123-124.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6 At a seminar held in London, United Kingdom Law Commissioner Faber D., concluded her</p><p style="text-align: justify;">presentation by saying: “The multimodal transport industry is investing heavily in improving its services. It is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a very sophisticated industry but the same cannot be said of its legal infrastructure. There is a large number of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transports conventions which are potentially applicable to any contract. This means that enormous sums,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">which would be better applied commercially, are spent in legal disputes as to whether the contract terms or a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">convention and, if so which convention, should apply to govern relations between contracting parties. The best</p><p style="text-align: justify;">way forward would be to abolish all the individual conventions and introduce one which would govern all</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport contracts, by whatever means of transport and whether unimodal or multimodal. This may mean</p><p style="text-align: justify;">legal expenditure in the short term, while precedents are established for the construction of such a convention,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2) and Montreal Conventions specifically include provisions dealing with transport of goods</p><p style="text-align: justify;">by more than one mode. In any event, in the absence of a uniform liability system for</p><p style="text-align: justify;">multimodal transport, the liability for each stage of transport is determined by the relevant</p><p style="text-align: justify;">unimodal convention or national laws which adopt varying approaches to issues such as the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">liability questions. Therefore, the liability of the multimodal transport operator for loss or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">damage to goods can differ depending on which stage of transport the loss has occurred. The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">question becomes even more complicated if the loss or damage cannot be localized, or the loss</p><p style="text-align: justify;">occurs gradually during the entire transport.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">13. Thus, the greatest shortcomings of transport law are considered to be: “the vast</p><p style="text-align: justify;">differences between the rules governing the different transport modes. Different grounds of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">liability, different limitations of liability, different documents with a different legal value,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">different time bars. Where it may perhaps be said that this particularism did not constitute</p><p style="text-align: justify;">such a formidable problem when unimodal transport was still predominant, its drawbacks</p><p style="text-align: justify;">become glaringly obvious when attempts are made to combine different transport modes, and,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">inevitably, their different legal regimes into a single transport operation governed by a single</p><p style="text-align: justify;">contract.”7</p><p style="text-align: justify;">14. These differences were also singled out by the Commission of the European</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Communities as one of the main obstacles in the field of trade facilitation. Thus, a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Communication to the Council for Trade in Goods of the World Trade Organization state</p><p style="text-align: justify;">that:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“The consequence of current arrangements is therefore a patchwork of régimes which</p><p style="text-align: justify;">fails to capitalize on modern IT-based communications systems and practices, which</p><p style="text-align: justify;">impedes the introduction and use of a single multimodal waybill/transport document,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and which does not reflect fully the increased use of containerized transportation</p><p style="text-align: justify;">operating across different modes, making mode-specific liability arrangements</p><p style="text-align: justify;">inappropriate. In cases of loss or damage to goods, this creates uncertainty as to the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">time of loss/damage, uncertainty as to mode and identity of the carrier; and uncertainty</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as to the applicable legal regime for liability and its effects.”8</p><p style="text-align: justify;">15. Again, a recent study by the European Commission9 describes the current legal ability</p><p style="text-align: justify;">framework in the following terms:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“The present legal framework determining a carrier’s liability consists of a confused</p><p style="text-align: justify;">jigsaw of international conventions designed to regulate unimodal carriage, diverse national</p><p style="text-align: justify;">laws and standard term contracts. ….As every intermodal transaction is made up of unimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">but in the long term it would obviate many of the current problems and save costs.” The Problems Arising</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From Multimodal Transport Law Seminar, 5-7 December 1994, Churchill Inter-Continental, London.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">7 De Wit R., <em>Multimodal Transport: Carrier Liability and Documentation</em>. Lloyd’s of London Press,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1995, 7.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">8 See Issues Relating to the Physical Movement of Consignments (Transport and Transit) &amp; Payment,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Insurance and other Financial Questions Affecting Cross-border Trade in Goods, G/C/W/133, 2 December</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1998, 3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9 “International Transportation and Carrier Liability”, June 1999, section 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9</p><p style="text-align: justify;">stages, there are a number of mandatory international liability regimes which are potentially</p><p style="text-align: justify;">applicable, depending on their scope of application and the stage of transport where a damage</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or loss occurs. Accordingly, two different regimes may apply to the same claim or the regime</p><p style="text-align: justify;">which applies can only be identified when it is clear during which stage of the transport a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">loss/damage occurred. Where the stage of transport during which a loss or damage occurred</p><p style="text-align: justify;">cannot be identified, where loss or damage occur gradually, or in the course of (value-added)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">services ancillary to transportation (e.g. warehousing), a carrier’s liability will often depend on</p><p style="text-align: justify;">national laws and/or contractual agreement. As a result, both the applicable liability rules and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the degree and extent of a carrier’s liability vary greatly from case to case and are</p><p style="text-align: justify;">unpredictable. Liability for delay in delivery is not always covered by the same rules as liability</p><p style="text-align: justify;">for loss of or damage to the goods.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D. Previous attempts to achieve uniformity</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">16. The establishment of a widely acceptable legal framework for multimodal transport has</p><p style="text-align: justify;">proved to be a difficult task. The first attempt was made by the International Institute for the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) and dates back as far as to the 1930s. The work</p><p style="text-align: justify;">within UNIDROIT resulted in the approval, by its Governing Council in 1963, of a “draft</p><p style="text-align: justify;">convention on the international combined transport of goods”,10 which was later revised by an</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ad hoc committee of experts. This was followed by the preparation and adoption by the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Comité Maritime International (CMI) of a “draft Convention on Combined Transport-Tokyo</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rules” in 1969. The draft conventions prepared by UNIDROIT and CMI were combined into</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a single text in 1970, under the auspices of the Inland Transport Committee of the UN</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE), known as the “Rome Draft.” This draft was</p><p style="text-align: justify;">further modified by meetings of the UN/ECE and the Intergovernmental Consultative</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Organization (IMCO) during 1970 and 1971, and came to be known as the “Draft Convention</p><p style="text-align: justify;">on the International Combined Transport of Goods”, better known as the “TCM draft ”, using</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the French acronym for “Transport Combiné de Marchandises.” The TCM draft never went</p><p style="text-align: justify;">beyond the drafting stage. Its provisions were, however, subsequently reflected in standard</p><p style="text-align: justify;">bills of lading such as the Baltic and International Maritime Conference’s (BIMCO)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Combiconbill and in the “Uniform Rules for a Combined Transport Document” of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).11</p><p style="text-align: justify;">17. The UN/IMCO Container Conference, which was to finalize the TCM draft in 1972,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">recommended that the subject be further studied, particularly its economic implications and the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">needs of developing countries. UNCTAD was proposed to undertake this task. The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Intergovernmental Preparatory Group (IPG) was then set up by the Trade and Development</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Board (Decision 96 (XII) of May 1973) and, following an extensive investigation, eventually</p><p style="text-align: justify;">prepared the draft convention leading to the adoption of the United Nations Convention on</p><p style="text-align: justify;">International Multimodal Transport of Goods 1980.12</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10 UDP 1963, ET.XL.II.DOC.29</p><p style="text-align: justify;">11 The ICC Uniform Rules were first issued in 1973 as publication No. 273. They were slightly revised</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in October 1975 to overcome practical difficulties of application concerning the combined transport operator’s</p><p style="text-align: justify;">liability for delay (ICC Publication No.298). The ICC Rules were conceived as an essential measure to avoid a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">multiplicity of documents for combined transport operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12 For further information see Selvig E., The background to the multimodal convention, paper delivered</p><p style="text-align: justify;">at a seminar in Southampton University, Faculty of Law, 12  September 1980; See also UNCTAD, The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(i) United Nations Convention on International Multimodal Transport</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>of Goods 1980</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">18. Although the Convention has not succeeded in attracting sufficient ratifications to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">enter into force13, its provisions have significantly influenced the type of legislation enacted in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">a number of countries/regions.14 The following are some of the main features of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convention:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">19. The Convention applies to all contracts of multimodal transport 15 between places in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">two States, if the place of taking in charge or delivery of the goods as provided for in the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">multimodal transport contract is located in a contracting State (article 2). While the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convention recognizes the right of the consignee to choose between multimodal and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">segmented transport, its provisions are to apply mandatorily to all contracts of multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport falling within the provisions of the Convention (article 3).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">20. The liability of the multimodal transport operator (MTO)16 for loss of, or damage to,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">goods as well as delay in delivery is based on the principle of “presumed fault or neglect.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">That is to say that the MTO is liable if the occurrence which caused the loss, damage or delay</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in delivery took place while the goods were in his charge, unless the MTO proves that he, his</p><p style="text-align: justify;">servants or agents or any other person of whose services he makes use for the performance of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the contract, took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the occurrence and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">its consequences.17 This provision is modelled on article 5 (1) of the Hamburg Rules.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">21. A key issue in the context of establishing the liability of the MTO for loss of, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">damage to, goods has been the choice between the “uniform” or “network” system of liability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the “uniform” system the same liability regime is applied to the entire multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport, irrespective of the stage at which the loss or damage occurred. Under the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“network” system, the liability of the MTO for localized damage (i.e. damage known to have</p><p style="text-align: justify;">occurred during a particular stage of transport) is determined by reference to the international</p><p style="text-align: justify;">convention or national law applicable to the unimodal stage of transport during which the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">damage occurred.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Economic and Commercial Implications of Entry into Force of the Hamburg Rules and Multimodal Transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convention, TD/B/C.4/3/5/Rev. 1, 1991, paragraphs. 39-45.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">13 The Convention was to enter into force one year after ratification or accession by 30 States. As of 15</p><p style="text-align: justify;">June 2001 only the following ten States have ratified or acceded to the Convention: Burundi, Chile, Georgia,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lebanon, Malawi, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal and Zambia. See http://untreaty.un.org/.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">14 See chapters II and III.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">15 “Multimodal transport contract” has been defined in article 1 (3) to mean “a contract whereby a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">multimodal transport operator undertakes, against payment of freight, to perform or to procure the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">performance of international multimodal transport.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">16 Article 1 (2) defines “MTO” as “any person who on his own behalf or through another person acting</p><p style="text-align: justify;">on his behalf concludes a multimodal transport contract and who acts as a principal, not as an agent or on</p><p style="text-align: justify;">behalf of the consignor or of the carriers participating in the multimodal transport operations, and who</p><p style="text-align: justify;">assumes responsibility for the performance of the contract.”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">17 Article 16 (1).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">11</p><p style="text-align: justify;">22. The Convention adopts a uniform system of liability of the MTO for both localized and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">non-localized damage (article 16 (1)), except that in cases of localized damage the limits of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">liability are to be determined by reference to the applicable international convention or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">mandatory national law which provide a higher limit of liability than that of the Convention</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(article 19). This approach, which is not entirely the “uniform”, is known as the “modified</p><p style="text-align: justify;">network” system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">23. The period of responsibility of the MTO includes the entire period during which he is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in charge of the goods, that is from the time he takes the goods in his charge to the time of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">delivery (article 14). The MTO is also liable for the acts and omissions of his servant or agent</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or any other person of whose services he makes use for the performance of the contract</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(article 15).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">24. The MTO’s liability for loss of, or damage to, goods is to be limited to an amount not</p><p style="text-align: justify;">exceeding 920 units of account per package or other shipping unit, or 2.75 units of account</p><p style="text-align: justify;">per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher. If,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">however, the multimodal transport does not, according to the contract, include carriage by sea</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or by inland waterway, the limitation amount is raised to a higher level of 8.33 units of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">account (identical to that of the CMR) per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">damaged, without alternative package limitation (article 18 (1) and (3)). The limitation of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">liability of the MTO for loss resulting from delay in delivery is calculated by reference to the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">rate of freight, that is an amount equivalent to two and a half times the freight payable for the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">goods delayed, but without exceeding the total freight payable under the multimodal transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">contract (article 18 (4)). The MTO, however, is not entitled to limit his liability if it is proved</p><p style="text-align: justify;">that the loss, damage or delay in delivery resulted from an act or omission of the MTO done</p><p style="text-align: justify;">with the intent to cause such loss, damage or delay or recklessly and with knowledge that such</p><p style="text-align: justify;">loss, damage or delay would probably result (article 21).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">25. The Convention provides for a period of two years within which legal proceedings</p><p style="text-align: justify;">relating to international multimodal transport have to be instituted in order to prevent the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">claim from being time-barred. A recourse action by the MTO for indemnity against subcontractors,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">however, is possible even after the expiry of limitation period, provided that it is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">permitted under the law of the State where proceedings are instituted and that it is not</p><p style="text-align: justify;">contrary to the provisions of another applicable international convention (article 25).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">26. The Convention includes extensive provisions on documentation covering negotiable</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and non-negotiable multimodal transport documents, their contents, reservations and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">evidentiary effect (articles 5 to 10).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">27. Concerning jurisdiction, the Convention gives a wide option to the claimant to institute</p><p style="text-align: justify;">an action for claims relating to international multimodal transport. It clearly provides that the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">plaintiff may sue in one of the following places:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The principal place of business or residence of the defendant;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(b) The place where the MT contract was made;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(c) The place of taking the goods in charge or the place of delivery; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(d) Any other place agreed upon and evidenced in the MT document (Article 26).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">28. Following the growing trend in international commercial disputes, the Convention also</p><p style="text-align: justify;">recognizes arbitration as an alternative to judicial proceedings. It provides that the parties</p><p style="text-align: justify;">may agree, in writing, to submit their disputes under the Convention to arbitration. As to the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">place of arbitration, the options available to the claimant for jurisdiction are also available in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">case of arbitration (article 27).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(ii) UNCTAD/ICC Rules for Multimodal Transport Documents</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">29. Pending the entry into force of the UN Convention on International Transport of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Goods 1980, the UNCTAD’s Committee on Shipping, by resolution 60 (XII) of November</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1986, instructed the secretariat to elaborate model provisions for multimodal transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">documents, in close collaboration with the competent commercial parties and international</p><p style="text-align: justify;">bodies, based on the Hague and Hague/Visby Rules as well as existing documents such as the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FBL (FIATA Bill of Lading) of the International Federation of Freight Forwarders</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Association (FIATA) and the ICC Uniform Rules for a Combined Transport Document.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following this resolution a joint UNCTAD/ICC working group was created to elaborate a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">new set of rules for multimodal transport documents. During a series of meetings the joint</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UNCTAD/ICC working group completed the preparation of the UNCTAD/ICC Rules for</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Multimodal Transport Documents in 1991. The Rules entered into force on 1 January 1992.18</p><p style="text-align: justify;">30. The UNCTAD/ICC Rules for Multimodal Transport Documents have been</p><p style="text-align: justify;">incorporated in widely used multimodal transport documents such as the FIATA FBL</p><p style="text-align: justify;">199219and the “MULTIDOC 95” of the Baltic and International Maritime Council</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(BIMCO).20 The main features of the UNCTAD/ICC Rules are the following:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">31. The Rules do not have the force of the law but are of purely contractual nature and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">apply only if they are incorporated into a contract of carriage, without any formal requirement</p><p style="text-align: justify;">for “writing” and irrespective of whether it is a contract for unimodal or multimodal transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">18 The text of the Rules can be found in ICC publication No. 481. They replaced the previous ICC Rules</p><p style="text-align: justify;">for a Combined Transport Document, 1973 (modified 1975) which were based on the “Tokyo Rules” and the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“TCM” draft.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">19 See FBL Negotiable FIATA Multimodal Transport Bill of Lading, issued subject to UNCTAD/ICC</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rules for Multimodal Transport Documents. The first FIATA FBL, called the FIATA Uniform Bill of Lading,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">was introduced in 1971 and was based on the Tokyo Rules developed by the CMI. A revised FIATA FBL was</p><p style="text-align: justify;">issued after the ICC introduced its Uniform Rules for a Combined Transport Document in 1975. See Öhl K.,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Development of the FIATA Multimodal Transport Bill of Lading based on the UNCTAD/ICC Rules for</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Multimodal Transport Documents, ICC seminar on the UNCTAD/ICC Rules for Multimodal Transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Documents, London, 28 January 1994.

The BIMCO’s previous Multimodal Transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Document known as the “COMBIDOC” was based on the previous ICC Rules for a Combined Transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Document 1975.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">13</p><p style="text-align: justify;">involving one or several modes of transport, or whether or not a document has been issued</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(Rule 1). Once they are incorporated into a contract, they override any conflicting contractual</p><p style="text-align: justify;">provisions, except in so far as they increase the responsibility or obligations of the multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport operator. The Rules, however, can only take effect to the extent that they are not</p><p style="text-align: justify;">contrary to the mandatory provisions of international conventions or national law applicable to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the multimodal transport contract (article 13).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">32. Similar to the MT Convention, the liability of the MTO under the Rules is based on the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">principle of presumed fault or neglect. That is to say that the MTO is liable for loss of, or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">damage to, the goods and for delay in delivery, if the occurrence which caused the loss,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">damage or delay in delivery took place while the goods were in his charge, unless he can prove</p><p style="text-align: justify;">that no fault or neglect of his own, his servants or agents or any other person of whose</p><p style="text-align: justify;">services he made use of for the performance of the contract, caused or contributed to the loss</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or delay in delivery (Rule 5.1). Although the basis of liability of the MTO under the Rules is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">similar to that under the MT Convention, there are significant differences between them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, unlike the MT Convention, under Rule 5.1, the MTO is not liable for loss following</p><p style="text-align: justify;">delay in delivery unless the consignor has made a declaration of interest in timely delivery</p><p style="text-align: justify;">which has been accepted by the MTO. Secondly, if the multimodal transport involves carriage</p><p style="text-align: justify;">by sea or inland waterways, the MTO will not be liable for “loss, damage or delay in delivery</p><p style="text-align: justify;">with respect to goods carried by sea or inland waterways when such loss, damage or delay</p><p style="text-align: justify;">during such carriage has been caused by:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">– fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier” (Rule 5.4).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">33. These defences, however, are made subject to an overriding requirement that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">whenever loss or damage resulted from unseaworthiness of the vessel, the MTO must prove</p><p style="text-align: justify;">that due diligence was exercised to make the ship seaworthy at the beginning of the voyage</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(Rule 5.4). The provisions of the Rule 5.4 are intended to make the liability of the MTO</p><p style="text-align: justify;">compatible with the Hague/Visby Rules for carriage by sea or inland waterways.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">34. Similar to the MT Convention, the period of responsibility of the MTO includes the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">period from the time he takes the goods in his charge until the time of their delivery.21</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore the MTO is also liable for the acts and omissions of his servants, agents or any</p><p style="text-align: justify;">other person of whose services he makes use for the performance of the contract (Rule 4.2).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">35. The limitation amounts established by the Rules for loss of, or damage to, goods are</p><p style="text-align: justify;">clearly lower than those of the MT Convention. They are based on the limits set by the SDR</p><p style="text-align: justify;">protocol of 1979 amending the limits of the Hague/Visby Rules. Thus, according to Rule 6.1,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">unless the nature and value of the goods have been declared by the consignor and inserted in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the MT document, the MTO shall not be liable for any loss of, or damage to, the goods in an</p><p style="text-align: justify;">amount exceeding the equivalent of 666.67 SDR (Special Drawing Rights) per package or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">unit, or 2 SDR per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">higher. In the same way as the MT Convention, a higher limit is provided for cases where the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">21 Rule 4.1. As to the definition of “delivery” see Rule 2.8.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">14</p><p style="text-align: justify;">multimodal transport does not, according to the contract, include carriage by sea or inland</p><p style="text-align: justify;">navigation. In such a case the liability of the MTO is limited to an amount not exceeding 8.33</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SDR per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged (Rule 6.3), without any</p><p style="text-align: justify;">reference to package limitation which is more appropriate for sea transport.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">36. Similar to the MT Convention, specific provisions on limitation of liability of the MTO</p><p style="text-align: justify;">are made for cases of localized damage. Under Rule 6.4, when the loss or damage occurs</p><p style="text-align: justify;">during one stage of transport, in respect of which an applicable international convention or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">mandatory national law would have provided another limit (and not a higher limit as provided</p><p style="text-align: justify;">by the MT Convention) of liability if a separate contract had been made for that particular</p><p style="text-align: justify;">stage of transport, then the limit of liability of the MTO for such loss or damage should be</p><p style="text-align: justify;">determined by reference to the provisions of such convention or mandatory national law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">37. The liability of the MTO for delay in delivery of the goods or consequential loss or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">damage is limited to an amount not exceeding the equivalent of the freight under the multimodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport contract (Rule 6.5). Finally, the MTO is not entitled to limit his liability if it is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">proved that the loss, damage or delay resulted from a personal act or omission of the MTO</p><p style="text-align: justify;">done with the intent to cause such loss, damage or delay, or recklessly and with knowledge</p><p style="text-align: justify;">that such loss, damage or delay would probably result (Rule 7).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">38. Rule 10 sets the period of time-bar at 9 months. Thus, the MTO will be relieved from</p><p style="text-align: justify;">liability unless the suit is brought within 9 months after delivery of the cargo, or of the date</p><p style="text-align: justify;">when the cargo should have been delivered. This is to allow the MTO possibility of instituting</p><p style="text-align: justify;">recourse action against the performing carrier, as most unimodal conventions such as the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hague/Visby Rules set the time-bar period at 1 year. The MT Convention provides for a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">period of two years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">39. The Rules envisage the possibility of issuing both “negotiable” and “non-negotiable”</p><p style="text-align: justify;">multimodal transport documents, including evidentiary effect of information contained in the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">document (Rules 2.6 and 3). However, the Rules, being of purely contractual nature, it is</p><p style="text-align: justify;">doubtful whether their incorporation into MT documents would have the effect of creating a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">negotiable document in all jurisdictions.22 Rule 3, concerning evidentiary effect of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">information contained in the multimodal transport document, provides that such information</p><p style="text-align: justify;">shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the taking in charge by the MTO of the goods as described in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the document unless contrary indications, such as “shipper’s weight, load and count”,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">“shipper-packed container” or similar expressions, have been included in the printed text or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">superimposed on the document. This would mean that such pre-printed clauses would destroy</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the evidentiary value of the document which is clearly undesirable. The Rule further provides</p><p style="text-align: justify;">22 In a majority of countries a document of title can only be created by custom, the law merchant or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">statute, but not through the agreement of the parties. This seems to be the case in German law, where a system</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of so-called Typenzwang–numerus clausus–excludes from the status of negotiable transport document any</p><p style="text-align: justify;">document not enumerated in the relevant commercial code and, from the status of document of title any</p><p style="text-align: justify;">document not expressly recognized as such by statute. Some continental law countries do, however, permit the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">parties to create negotiable documents of title by agreement through an “open system of negotiable documents</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of title.” De Wit R., Multimodal Transport, 318; Recalde Castells A., <em>El Conocimiento de Embarque y otros</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Documentos del Transporte, editorial Civitas</em>, 1992, 346-348; See for a different view as to the creation of new</p><p style="text-align: justify;">documents of title Bools M., <em>The Bill of Lading: A Document of Title to Goods-An Anglo-American</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Comparison</em>, Lloyd’s of London Press, 1997, 184-186. See as well Tantin G., Les Documents de Transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Combiné, <em>European Transport Law</em>, Vol. XV No. 4, 1980, 382-383.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">15</p><p style="text-align: justify;">that proof to the contrary shall not be admissible when the MT document has been transferred</p><p style="text-align: justify;">to the consignee, who in good faith has relied and acted on such information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">40. Unlike the MT Convention, the Rules do not include any provisions dealing with</p><p style="text-align: justify;">jurisdiction and arbitration. Multimodal transport documents currently used in practice usually</p><p style="text-align: justify;">provide for any dispute to be determined by the courts in accordance with the law at the place</p><p style="text-align: justify;">where the MTO has his principal place of business.23</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E. Related activities of other organizations</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">41. The lack of a uniform liability regime governing maritime and multimodal transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">operations and the proliferation of diverse national approaches, prompted a number of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">organizations to initiate investigations into the subject with the aim of establishing possible</p><p style="text-align: justify;">solution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">42. Following mandates from the UN/ECE Inland Transport Committee and the Working</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Party on Combined Transport (WP. 24) to consider the possibilities for reconciliation and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">harmonization of civil liability regimes governing combined transport, the UN/ECE secretariat</p><p style="text-align: justify;">convened two informal ad hoc expert group meetings,24 to hear the views of the industry</p><p style="text-align: justify;">including the relevant international organizations.25 The subject was considered by the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UN/ECE Working Party on Combined Transport at its thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth sessions</p><p style="text-align: justify;">held in September 2000 and April 2001 respectively. It was also discussed by the UN/ECE</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Inland Transport Committee in February 2001, and the Committee, having endorsed the work</p><p style="text-align: justify;">carried out so far by the ad hoc expert group, requested the group to pursue the complex task</p><p style="text-align: justify;">towards a harmonized civil liability regime covering multimodal transport operations.26</p><p style="text-align: justify;">43. The Commission of the European Communities has identified the current intermodal</p><p style="text-align: justify;">arrangements in its communication on “Intermodality and Intermodal Freight Transport in the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">European Union”27 as “an area of friction costs.” Modally oriented cargo liability</p><p style="text-align: justify;">arrangements, which do not provide the shippers with a transparent and uniform liability</p><p style="text-align: justify;">regime, are considered to result in uncertainty and higher costs due to claims handling and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">litigation. With a view to making an inventory of the present liability arrangements and to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">identify possible approaches to solve the current deadlock, the Commission has sponsored a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">study on “intermodal transportation and carrier liability” (June 1999), which examines the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">problems associated with lack of coherent liability regime, including possible future regulatory</p><p style="text-align: justify;">options. It is understood that, as a follow-up, the Commission has launched an investigation</p><p style="text-align: justify;">into the economic impact of intermodal liability arrangements, the results of which could help</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in defining a possible new approach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">23 See “MULTIDOC” 95, article 5, and FIATA FBL 92, article 19.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">24 12-13 July 1999, and 24-25 January 2000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">25 See TRANS/WP.24/2000/3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">26 See ECE/TRANS/136.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">27 Com (97) 243.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">16</p><p style="text-align: justify;">44. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Maritime</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Transport Committee has considered the need for investigation into the existing cargo liability</p><p style="text-align: justify;">regimes with a view to finding a workable solution. The objective of the OECD project was to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">identify those elements of the existing cargo liability regimes governing maritime transport for</p><p style="text-align: justify;">which there is no general agreement, and attempt to find workable formulations that will allow</p><p style="text-align: justify;">them to be broadly acceptable to all parties. It was envisaged that such possible compromise</p><p style="text-align: justify;">formulations could form the basis of a widely acceptable set of common rules for further</p><p style="text-align: justify;">international consideration in an appropriate forum.28 A workshop on cargo liability, organized</p><p style="text-align: justify;">by the OECD’s Maritime Transport committee (MTC)29, considered the issues identified in a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">report prepared by a consultant at the initiative of the MTC, in order to establish whether</p><p style="text-align: justify;">there might be some common ground or convergence that may provide some guidance to a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">future diplomatic conference. The report of the workshop is “offered to interested parties, be</p><p style="text-align: justify;">they governments, industry or international organizations that may in the future consider</p><p style="text-align: justify;">hosting or participating in diplomatic conferences to review cargo liability, as representing the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">end result of deliberations between these parties.” Thus, while the outcome is not binding on</p><p style="text-align: justify;">any party, it is nevertheless intended to “offer some guidance as to the policy outcome that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">may be necessary to maximise the formulation of a more comprehensive, and generally</p><p style="text-align: justify;">acceptable form of cargo liability regime.”30</p><p style="text-align: justify;">45. In the context of the work of the United Nation’s Commission on International Trade</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Law (UNCITRAL) on electronic commerce, it was pointed out by some delegations that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">fragmented and disparate national laws and legislation regarding certain aspects of transport</p><p style="text-align: justify;">law other than issues of liability, as well as significant gaps left by national laws and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">international conventions regarding issues such as the functioning of bills of lading and sea</p><p style="text-align: justify;">waybills, did not facilitate transition of trade practices to electronic alternatives. The</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UNCITRAL Commission, at its twenty-ninth session, in 1996, therefore, requested the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">secretariat to be the focal point for gathering information, ideas and opinions as to problems in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport law that arose in practice and possible solutions to those problems. Upon a request</p><p style="text-align: justify;">from the UNCITRAL secretariat, the CMI began investigation of the subject. Following a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">report on the progress of work within the CMI to the UNCITRAL Commission at its thirtythird</p><p style="text-align: justify;">session in June 2000, the Commission requested the UNCITRAL secretariat to continue</p><p style="text-align: justify;">cooperating with the CMI in order to present a report at its next session, identifying possible</p><p style="text-align: justify;">future work in the area of transport law.31 In the meantime, the CMI had been preparing a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">draft text of an outline instrument on transport law issues covering various aspects of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">transport law including liability for loss of, or damage to, cargo. The core principles and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">issues involved were discussed at the 37th CMI Conference,32 following which the Outline</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instrument is to be redrafted. It is proposed to extend the period of responsibility of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">28 See DSTI/DOT/MTC (99) 19, October 1999.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">29 In January 25-26, 2001 in Paris.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">30 See the report of the Workshop on Cargo Liability Regimes: http://www.oecd.org/</p><p style="text-align: justify;">dsti/sti/transpor/sea/index.htm</p><p style="text-align: justify;">31 See the report of the Commission at its thirty-third Session, 2 June-7 July 2000, General Assembly</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Official Records, fifty-fifth session, Supplement No. 17 (A/55/17).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">32 Held in Singapore in February 2001.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">17</p><p style="text-align: justify;">carrier to cover inland carriage preceding or subsequent to sea carriage during which he is in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">charge of the goods.

Such</p><p style="text-align: justify;">authorities and liaison points must be accessible on a continuous basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">9</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 8</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For purposes of preventing offences under this Convention, States Parties shall make</p><p style="text-align: justify;">every effort to adopt appropriate measures to ensure the protection of radioactive</p><p style="text-align: justify;">material, taking into account relevant recommendations and functions of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 9</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its</p><p style="text-align: justify;">jurisdiction over the offences set forth in article 2 when:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>a</em>) The offence is committed in the territory of that State; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>b</em>) The offence is committed on board a vessel flying the flag of that State or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">an aircraft which is registered under the laws of that State at the time the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">offence is committed; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>c</em>) The offence is committed by a national of that State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. A State Party may also establish its jurisdiction over any such offence when:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>a</em>) The offence is committed against a national of that State; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>b</em>) The offence is committed against a State or government facility of that</p><p style="text-align: justify;">State abroad, including an embassy or other diplomatic or consular</p><p style="text-align: justify;">premises of that State; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>c</em>) The offence is committed by a stateless person who has his or her</p><p style="text-align: justify;">habitual residence in the territory of that State; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>d</em>) The offence is committed in an attempt to compel that State to do</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or abstain from doing any act; or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>e</em>) The offence is committed on board an aircraft which is operated</p><p style="text-align: justify;">by the Government of that State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. Upon ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to this Convention, each State</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Party shall notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the jurisdiction it has</p><p style="text-align: justify;">established under its national law in accordance with paragraph 2 of the present article.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Should any change take place, the State Party concerned shall immediately notify the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Secretary-General.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">10</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">establish its jurisdiction over the offences set forth in article 2 in cases where the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite that person to any of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the States Parties which have established their jurisdiction in accordance with</p><p style="text-align: justify;">paragraph 1 or 2 of the present article.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. This Convention does not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction</p><p style="text-align: justify;">established by a State Party in accordance with its national law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 10</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. Upon receiving information that an offence set forth in article 2 has been</p><p style="text-align: justify;">committed or is being committed in the territory of a State Party or that a person who</p><p style="text-align: justify;">has committed or who is alleged to have committed such an offence may be present in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">its territory, the State Party concerned shall take such measures as may be necessary</p><p style="text-align: justify;">under its national law to investigate the facts contained in the information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, the State Party in whose</p><p style="text-align: justify;">territory the offender or alleged offender is present shall take the appropriate measures</p><p style="text-align: justify;">under its national law so as to ensure that person’s presence for the purpose of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">prosecution or extradition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 2 of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">present article are being taken shall be entitled:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>a</em>) To communicate without delay with the nearest appropriate representative</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of the State of which that person is a national or which is otherwise entitled</p><p style="text-align: justify;">to protect that person’s rights or, if that person is a stateless person, the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">State in the territory of which that person habitually resides;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>b</em>) To be visited by a representative of that State;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>c) </em>To be informed of that person’s rights under subparagraphs (<em>a</em>)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">and (<em>b</em>).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. The rights referred to in paragraph 3 of the present article shall be exercised in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">conformity with the laws and regulations of the State in the territory of which the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">offender or alleged offender is present, subject to the provision that the said laws and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights</p><p style="text-align: justify;">accorded under paragraph 3 are intended.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the present article shall be without</p><p style="text-align: justify;">prejudice to the right of any State Party having a claim to jurisdiction in accordance</p><p style="text-align: justify;">11</p><p style="text-align: justify;">with article 9, paragraph 1 (<em>c</em>) or 2 (<em>c</em>), to invite the International Committee of the Red</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cross to communicate with and visit the alleged offender.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6. When a State Party, pursuant to the present article, has taken a person into</p><p style="text-align: justify;">custody, it shall immediately notify, directly or through the Secretary- General of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">United Nations, the States Parties which have established jurisdiction in accordance</p><p style="text-align: justify;">with article 9, paragraphs 1 and 2, and, if it considers it advisable, any other interested</p><p style="text-align: justify;">States Parties, of the fact that that person is in custody and of the circumstances which</p><p style="text-align: justify;">warrant that person’s detention. The State which makes the investigation contemplated</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in paragraph 1 of the present article shall promptly inform the said States Parties of its</p><p style="text-align: justify;">findings and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 11</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. The State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is present shall, in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">cases to which article 9 applies, if it does not extradite that person, be obliged, without</p><p style="text-align: justify;">exception whatsoever and whether or not the offence was committed in its territory, to</p><p style="text-align: justify;">submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of that State. Those</p><p style="text-align: justify;">authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any other</p><p style="text-align: justify;">offence of a grave nature under the law of that State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Whenever a State Party is permitted under its national law to extradite or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">otherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be</p><p style="text-align: justify;">returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or</p><p style="text-align: justify;">proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought, and this</p><p style="text-align: justify;">State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">other terms they may deem appropriate, such a conditional extradition or surrender</p><p style="text-align: justify;">shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 1 of the present</p><p style="text-align: justify;">article.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 12</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any person who is taken into custody or regarding whom any other measures are taken</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or proceedings are carried out pursuant to this Convention shall be guaranteed fair</p><p style="text-align: justify;">treatment, including enjoyment of all rights and guarantees in conformity with the law</p><p style="text-align: justify;">of the State in the territory of which that person is present and applicable provisions of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">international law, including international law of human rights.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 13</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. The offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable</p><p style="text-align: justify;">offences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the States Parties before the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">entry into force of this Convention. States Parties undertake to include such offences as</p><p style="text-align: justify;">extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently concluded between</p><p style="text-align: justify;">them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no</p><p style="text-align: justify;">extradition treaty, the requested State Party may, at its option, consider this</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the</p><p style="text-align: justify;">requested State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">treaty shall recognize the offences set forth in article 2 as extraditable offences</p><p style="text-align: justify;">between themselves, subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested</p><p style="text-align: justify;">State.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. If necessary, the offences set forth in article 2 shall be treated, for the purposes of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place</p><p style="text-align: justify;">in which they occurred but also in the territory of the States that have established</p><p style="text-align: justify;">jurisdiction in accordance with article 9, paragraphs 1 and 2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5. The provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements between States Parties</p><p style="text-align: justify;">with regard to offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be modified as between</p><p style="text-align: justify;">States Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 14</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">connection with investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings brought in</p><p style="text-align: justify;">respect of the offences set forth in article 2, including assistance in obtaining evidence</p><p style="text-align: justify;">at their disposal necessary for the proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 of the present</p><p style="text-align: justify;">article in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance</p><p style="text-align: justify;">that may exist between them. In the absence of such treaties or arrangements, States</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with their national law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">13</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 15</p><p style="text-align: justify;">None of the offences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded, for the purposes of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">extradition or mutual legal assistance, as a political offence or as an offence connected</p><p style="text-align: justify;">with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a</p><p style="text-align: justify;">request for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an offence may not</p><p style="text-align: justify;">be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political offence or an offence</p><p style="text-align: justify;">connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 16</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite</p><p style="text-align: justify;">or to afford mutual legal assistance if the requested State Party has substantial grounds</p><p style="text-align: justify;">for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for</p><p style="text-align: justify;">mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s race, religion,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would</p><p style="text-align: justify;">cause prejudice to that person’s position for any of these reasons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 17</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one</p><p style="text-align: justify;">State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of</p><p style="text-align: justify;">testimony, identification or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for</p><p style="text-align: justify;">the investigation or prosecution of offences under this Convention may be transferred</p><p style="text-align: justify;">if the following conditions are met:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>a</em>) The person freely gives his or her informed consent; and</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>b</em>) The competent authorities of both States agree, subject to such conditions</p><p style="text-align: justify;">as those States may deem appropriate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.

Among the measures proposed by the UNSG was preventing the use of weapons of mass destruc-tion (WMD) by terrorists.</p><p>The draft convention was proposed by the Russian Federation, and considered by the Legal Committee of the UN General Assembly. UN General Assembly Resolution 51/210 of 17  December, 1996 established an Ad Hoc Committee to elaborate the draft conven-tion.</p><p>The Russian Federation, in its explanatory note on the draft convention, noted that the 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) had a number of substantial gaps concern-ing countering acts of nuclear terrorism, particularly at the stage of stopping the terrorist act and eliminat-ing its consequences. It claimed the CPPNM alone was not able to eliminate the danger of nuclear terror-ism in all its manifestations, and therefore, the draft convention was aimed at combating new and danger-ous manifestations of terrorism, stimulating the adop-tion of effective preventive measures in that sphere, and establishing a reliable international legal me-chanism for cooperation at all stages of combating nuclear terrorism. The Russian Federation claimed that the draft convention was particularly significant in that it was the first international legal instrument in the area of anti-terrorist activities that was specially designed as a “pre-emptive instrument.” Several concerns delayed the adoption of the conven-tion for many years. Foremost among these concerns related to Article IV. Many non-nuclear weapon States (NNWS), in particular the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), opposed any language that could legitimize the use of nuclear weapons by military forces of nuclear weapon States (NWS). These con-cerns were addressed by the adoption of an amend-ment added to Article IV stipulating that the conven-tion cannot be interpreted as addressing the “legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons by States.” Other difficulties included lack of agreement on a definition of terrorism. Although the convention de-fines several related issues, it contains no definition of terrorism.</p><p>A number of delegations also preferred focusing on the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, since progress on the definition of terror-ism would have a positive impact on the draft Nuc-lear Terrorism Convention. The 35th meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Inter-national Terrorism reached an agreement to offer the document for signature based on its ability to over-come the final obstacles to the committee’s consen-sus approval. Committee members noted that the clarification of Article IV, as well as agreements by Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, and the United States to withdraw certain amendments, allowed the conven-tion to pass.</p><p>The General Assembly unanimously approved the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism on 13  April 2005 during the 91st plenary meeting of the General Assembly by resolution A/RES/59/290, the first anti-terrorism trea-ty adopted since the 11  September 2001 attacks. The treaty, which places no new restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons by States, will become effective after it is ratified by 22 States. The treaty opened for signature on 14  September 2005, and with the 22nd ratification (Bangladesh), the treaty entered into force on 7 July 2007.</p><p>The nuclear terrorism convention will join the 12 existing universal anti-terrorism conventions, streng-</p><p>NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/19/2010</p><p>thening the international legal framework in connec-tion with terrorist acts and further promoting the rule of law. Key provisions of the convention include:</p><p>? A wider definition (than the Convention on the Protection of Nuclear Materials) on ma-terials and facilities covering both military and peaceful applications</p><p>? The criminalization of planning, threatening, or carrying out acts of nuclear terrorism; it also requires States to criminalize these of-fenses via national legislation and to estab-lish penalties in line with the gravity of such crimes</p><p>? Conditions under which States may establish jurisdiction for offenses</p><p>? Guidelines for extradition and other meas-ures of punishment</p><p>? The requirement for States to take all prac-ticable measures to prevent and counter preparations for offenses to take place inside or outside of their territories</p><p>? The distinction that the convention does not cover the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict or military exercise.</p><p>Presently, there are 115 signatories to the convention. 66 States have ratified the convention (Antigua and Barbuda, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Fiji, Finland, Gabon, Georgia, Germany, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, India, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malawi, Mali, FYR Macedonia, Mauritania, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Nicaragua, Niger, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Uzbekistan).</p><p>Provisions: The convention defines the act of nuclear terrorism as the use or threat to use nuclear material, nuclear fuel, radioactive products or waste, or any other radioactive substances with toxic, explosive, or other dangerous properties. The definition includes the use or threat to use any nuclear installations, nuc-lear explosive, or radiation devices in order to kill or injure persons, damage property, or the environment, or to compel persons, States, or international organi-zations to do or to refrain from doing any act. The unauthorized receipt through fraud, theft, or forcible seizure of any nuclear material, radioactive sub-stances, nuclear installations, or nuclear explosive devices belonging to a State Party, or demands by the threat or use of force or by other forms of intimida-tion for the transfer of such material would also be regarded as acts of nuclear terrorism. The convention applies exclusively to acts by indi-viduals, and its scope would not include the issue of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons or nuclear threats posed by States or intergovernmental organi-zations. Compliance and Enforcement: The convention obligates the parties to cooperate in preventing or prosecuting acts of nuclear terrorism by adopting necessary legislative and technical measures to pro-tect nuclear material, installations and devices, and to forestall unauthorized access to them by third parties. The convention does not affect international law pro-visions on States’ competence to conduct investiga-tions on vessels that were not flying their flags or in aircraft that were not registered in their territories. States Parties would help each other in prosecuting the relevant acts and, when the prosecution is com-pleted, any nuclear material or devices would be re-turned to the State Party to which they belonged. Developments: 2010: The following States became parties to the Convention in 2010: Morocco (31 March), Poland (8 April), Georgia (23 April), and Bahrain (4 May).</p><p>On 13 April, the Communiqué of the Washington Nuclear Security Summit expressed support for the objectives of the Convention as an essential compo-nent of the global nuclear security architecture. Fur-thermore, the Convention was the first item at the top of the Summit Work Plan, which encouraged partici-pating states to achieve universality of the Conven-tion, assist States with its implementation, and dis-cuss measures for its effective implementation. 2009: The following States became parties to the Convention in 2009: Finland (13 Jan.), Azerbaijan (28 Jan.), Paraguay (29 Jan.), Nicaragua (25 Feb.), Peru (29 May), Cuba (17 June), United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (24 Sept.), Solo-mon Islands (24 Sept.), Brazil (25 Sept.), Liechtens-tein (25 Sept.), and Malawi (Oct. 7).</p><p>NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/19/2010</p><p>At the 2009 NPT PrepCom, all three versions of the draft recommendations for the 2010 Review Confe-rence sought to affirm the importance of the full im-plementation of the Convention as a means to streng-then nuclear safety and security. UN Security Council Resolution 1887, adopted un-animously on 24 September, called for universal ad-herence to the Convention. 2008: The following States became parties to the Convention in 2008: United Arab Emirates (10 Jan.), Cyprus (28 Jan.), Germany (8 Feb.), Central African Republic (19 Feb.), Turkmenistan (28 Mar.), Moldo-va (18 April), Mauritania (28 April), Uzbekistan (29 April), Fiji (15 May), Dominican Republic (11 June), Niger (2 July), Kazakhstan (31 July), Guinea-Bissau (6 Aug.), Burundi (24 Sept.), Luxembourg (2 Oct.), Switzerland (15 Oct.), Libya (22 Dec.). 2007: On 7 June 2007, Bangladesh became the 22nd country to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, allowing the treaty to enter into force thirty days later on 7 July 2007. The following States deposited instruments of ratifi-cation or accession to the Convention in 2007: Ro-mania (24 Jan.), Russian Federation (29 Jan.), Spain (22 Feb.), Comoros (12 Mar.), Belarus (13 Mar.), FYR Macedonia (19 Mar.), Denmark (20 Mar.), Hungary (12 April), South Africa (9 May), Croatia (30 May), Bangladesh (7 June), Panama (21 June), Lithuania (19 July), Japan (3 Aug.), Ukraine (25 Sept.), Sri Lanka (27 Sept.), Gabon (1 Oct.), Kyr-gyzstan (2 Oct.), Saudi Arabia (7 Dec.).</p><p>2006: The Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly Resolution 51/210 took place from 27 Feb-ruary to 3 March 2006 at United Nations Headquar-ters in New York. In its 10th session, on 3 March, the Ad Hoc Committee adopted its Report (A/61/37). The committee was chaired by Ambassador Rohan Perera (Sri Lanka) and vice-chaired by Carlos Fer-nando Díaz Paniagua (Costa Rica), Maria Telalian (Greece), and Sabelo Sivuyile Maqungo (South Afri-ca). The chairman’s report noted that during the committee meetings substantial efforts were made to explore further whether there might be possible sug-gestions on which a compromise solution on the out-standing issues regarding the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism could be based.</p><p>The following States deposited instruments of ratifi-cation in 2006: Slovakia (23 Mar.), Kenya (13 April), Mexico (27 June), Czech Republic (25 July), Latvia (25 July), Austria (14 Sept.), Serbia (26 Sept.), Mon-golia (6 Oct.), Lebanon (13 Nov.), El Salvador (27 Nov.), India (1 Dec.).</p><p>2005: The Ad Hoc Committee established by Gener-al Assembly Resolution 51/210 of 17 December  1996, entitled “Measures to eliminate international terrorism” completed seven years’ drafting work by adopting the draft convention, by consensus, without amendment. In its ninth session from 28 March to 1 April 2005, the committee was chaired by Ambassa-dor Rohan Perera (Sri Lanka). Carlos Fernando Diaz Paniagua (Costa Rica), Albert Hoffman (South Afri-ca), and Maria Telalian (Greece) served as vice-chairs. Distinct from prior years, the political will and mo-mentum to conclude the draft texts of the convention existed, in part, due to the impetus of the December 2004 High Level Panel Report on Threats, Chal-lenges and Change and the secretary-general’s March 2005 report, In Larger Freedom. An agreement on the text was struck after it was assured that the treaty would not be used to impose a generic definition on terrorism, a highly controversial issue. Informal consultations were conducted by the chair, during the course of which four new proposals were presented for amendments on behalf of Cuba (A/AC.252/2005/WP.2), Egypt (A/AC.252.2005/WP.3), the United States of Ameri-ca (A/AC.252.2005/WP.4), as well as the Islamic Republic of Iran (A/AC.252.2005/WP.5). The chair advised these delegates that the proposals did not enjoy great support, as evidenced through debate during consultation. He requested that the respective sponsors withdraw their proposals in the interest of finalizing the draft. All sponsor nations agreed to the withdrawal of their proposals. In addition, the Syrian proposal to remove paragraphs two and three from Article IV was not adopted. With regard to Article IV, it was recognized that the final draft was “based on the International Conven-tion for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and that it constituted a compromise text aimed at bridging the diverging views on the matter.” As such, a large majority of delegations supported the current wording of Article IV (with the inclusion of subparagraph 4, adopted at a previous meeting), and it was accepted in the final adoption of the text.</p><p>The committee requested the secretary-general to adopt and open the convention for signature at UN headquarters from 14 September 2005 to 31 Decem-</p><p>NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/19/2010</p><p>ber 2006. The General Assembly subsequently un-animously approved the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism on 13 April 2005 during the 91st plenary meeting of the General Assembly by resolution A/RES/59/290. 2004: The eighth session of the Ad Hoc Committee (established in 1996 with the mandate of developing a collection of conventions to supplement existing legal instruments against international terrorism in its various forms) was held from 28 June to 2 July at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. Coordi-nators’ reports indicated that States continued to di-verge in their views on several aspects of the draft convention, despite their agreement that terrorism constitutes a pressing issue and that the draft urgently needs to be finalized. Coordinator Albert Hoffman of South Africa reported that delegates differed over whether or not the committee should continue with negotiations. Specifically, long-standing disagreement persisted regarding Article IV of the draft convention, which deals with possible exemptions to its terms and its applicability or lack thereof to States’ own armed forces and their use of nuclear weapons. Many had expressed the view that the convention should not act as a “law enforcement instrument,” which it might, some worried, if it addressed the issue of whether or not the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is il-legal for a State. Syria proposed an amendment to Article IV by deleting its second and third para-graphs, which make reference to the legality of States’ use of nuclear weapons. At a previous session in 2002, Mexico had offered an alternative revision of the article suggesting the addi-tion of a paragraph stating that the convention did not seek to address “the issue of the legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons by States,” but some delegations expressed concern that it was insufficient. Delegations also expressed differences of opinion regarding the definition of nuclear weapons as stated in Article I of the draft convention, and about a pro-posal to address the dumping of toxic waste. Costa Rica contended that the international fight against terrorism be universalized, perhaps through the estab-lishment of a UN high commissioner against terror-ism. The committee’s report included recommendations that the Sixth Committee of the UN General Assem-bly continue the process of negotiating the draft con-vention and also consider planning a high-level UN conference to address terrorism-related concerns.</p><p>2003: The Ad Hoc Committee met for its seventh annual session from 31 March to 2 April, under Chairman Rohan Perera (Sri Lanka). During general discussion at its plenary meeting on 31 March, some delegations described the adoption of an International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism as “a pressing and urgent need in view of the risk posed should certain terrorist groups gain access to weapons of mass destruction,” and thus expressed support for the advancement of work on the draft text. However, in a report presented on the results of bilateral consultations held with delegations “to review the situation in relation to the outstanding issues and to ascertain if there was a possibility of resolving differences,” the meeting’s coordinator noted several problematic areas. The report noted concerns regarding Article IV of the draft conven-tion; while some delegations reiterated that the cur-rent text should remain, others were dissatisfied with it and suggested that the relationship between the draft convention and States’ nuclear- or weapons-related actions be better defined. Mexico’s proposal for an additional paragraph was also discussed, with some delegations expressing support for and others disagreeing with it. The coordinator concluded that “although views on the outstanding issues continue to be divergent, without any clear consensus emerging, it was also noted that the important progress achieved, which was reflected in the current text, should be retained.” Also during the session, the Ad Hoc Committee de-cided to recommend that the Sixth Committee, sche-duled to meet in the fall, establish a Working Group to continue efforts toward the adoption of both a draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terror-ism and the draft International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</p><p>On 6 October, the Sixth Committee convened and established a Working Group, to be open to all mem-ber States of the United Nations, the specialized agencies, or the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rohan Perera (Sri Lanka) was elected as the group’s chairman, and Albert Hoffman (South Afri-ca) was appointed coordinator for the Draft Interna-tional Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Informal consultations were held on 7 October, with the second part of these focusing on the draft convention. In a summary, issued follow-ing these consultations, the coordinator stated that delegations had primarily re-voiced their previous views regarding Article IV, and that many felt that inability to agree on the draft would hinder work to-ward adopting a Comprehensive Convention on In-</p><p>NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/19/2010</p><p>ternational Terrorism and amending the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The Working Group decided to recommend to the Sixth Committee the continuation of work toward finalizing the draft convention’s text, particularly in regards to Article IV.</p><p>On 9 December, following the meetings of the Sixth Committee, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 58/81 on measures to eliminate international terrorism. Among other recommenda-tions, it decided that the Ad Hoc Committee should continue work on resolving the remaining issues sur-rounding the Draft International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism “as a means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions.” The resolution also stated that the committee should aim to convene a high-level conference under the UN in order to pro-duce a cooperative international response to terror-ism. Further, it was decided that the Ad Hoc Commit-tee would meet again from 28 June to 2 July 2004, and that, if the draft convention were completed, the committee should report to the General Assembly during its 58th session and report any progress on its implementation during the 59th session.</p><p>2002: During the 28 January to 1 February session of the Ad Hoc Committee, informal consultations fo-cused on the outstanding issues pertaining to the draft International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. In that regard, the representa-tive of the IAEA briefed delegations on the Agency’s measures aimed at combating acts of terrorism in-volving nuclear materials and other radioactive mate-rials. In its report, the Committee recommended allo-cating appropriate time for the continued considera-tion of the outstanding issues on the nuclear terrorism convention.</p><p>Also during the session, Mexico submitted a proposal to amend Article IV of the draft convention, which addressed the relationship between the convention and the rights of States’ armed forces to use nuclear weapons. It sought the addition of the following pa-ragraph in order to clarify the convention’s relation-ship to the rights of States’ armed forces: “This con-vention does not address, nor can it be interpreted as addressing, in any way the issue of the legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons by States.”</p><p>On 7 October, at its 11th meeting, the Sixth Commit-tee established a Working Group to continue to work on the elaboration of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, and to allocate appropriate time for the continued consideration of the outstand-ing issues on the nuclear terrorism convention. At the same meeting, the Committee decided to open the Working Group to all States Members of the United Nations or members of the specialized agencies or of the IAEA. The Working Group held two meetings on 15 and 16 October. At its first meeting on 15 October, the Working Group decided to proceed with discussions in informal consultations, which were held in two stages: the first focused on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism, and the second on the outstanding issues pertaining to the draft In-ternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. At the second meeting, on 16 October, the coordinator of the informal consultations presented an oral report on the results of discussions on both draft conventions. The Working Group de-cided to recommend to the Sixth Committee that work continue with the aim of finalizing the text of a draft comprehensive convention on international ter-rorism and the text of a draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism, build-ing upon the work accomplished during the meetings of the Working Group. 2001: At its February meetings, the Ad Hoc Commit-tee delegations were unable to conduct substantive work on the draft convention. They agreed to contin-ue consultations to resolve outstanding issues. Some delegations favored the inclusion of provisions deal-ing with the dumping of radioactive waste in the draft convention. At the October debate on measures to eliminate in-ternational terrorism in the UNGA, views were ex-pressed on the early completion of the draft conven-tion. The meeting of the Sixth Committee Working Group was scheduled to take place from 15 to 26 October. On 18 October, the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Com-mittee noted that work on the draft convention had largely been completed. He noted that there remained only one outstanding issue regarding the scope of the draft convention and that this issue required resolu-tion at the policy level.</p><p>2000: During the Ad Hoc Committee meeting in Feb-ruary, the States discussed the revised text of the draft convention prepared by the Friends of the Chair. The Australian representative, Ms. Cate Steains, re-ported that during the inter-sessional informal consul-tations, the States were unable to bridge differences concerning the scope of the draft convention and that consultations would continue on a bilateral basis. The inter-sessional consultations as well as bilateral con-</p><p>NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/19/2010</p><p>sultations held during the meeting revealed the exis-tence of several important problems:</p><p>? Some delegations wanted provisions of Article IV, Par. 2 regarding the protection of nuclear in-stallations and devices to be deleted and noted that any proposals to the contrary would be unac-ceptable.</p><p>? Some delegations made it clear that they did not attach high priority to the adoption of the draft convention since much of its substance was cov-ered by the existing conventions.</p><p>? Some delegations pointed out that the difference of opinion on the scope of the draft conventions were too fundamental to be bridged.</p><p>? Some delegations insisted that the scope of the draft convention should be extended to cover acts of State terrorism, including acts of State armed forces.</p><p>? Some advocated the inclusion of provisions re-lated to the dumping of radioactive waste.</p><p>? Some delegations raised the question of the legali-ty of the possession of nuclear weapons, while others claimed that this question had no bearing on the issues before the Committee and only dis-tracted it from substantive work.</p><p>Several delegations urged the Committee to complete the draft convention expeditiously. The participants in the end decided to continue further inter-sessional consultations for the consideration of the Sixth Committee’s Working Group in September-October. At the September-October meetings of the Working Group and the November meeting of the Sixth Com-mittee, it was concluded that the inter-sessional con-sultations had not led to successful resolution of out-standing problems and that further broader consulta-tions might be required in the pursuit of a solution that would lead to the adoption of the draft conven-tion. Several speakers favored the speedy completion of work on the draft convention as well as its adop-tion.</p><p>In its Resolution 55/158, the UNGA called on the Ad Hoc Committee to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the elaboration of the draft convention. The language of the resolution suggested that the consideration of the draft Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism should take priority over the resolution of outstanding differences over the draft convention.</p><p>1999: At the March meeting of the Ad Hoc Commit-tee, Russia urged States to adopt the draft text as soon as possible and warned that failure to agree on the draft text would send the wrong signal to the terrorist groups. Some States supported the early agreement on the draft convention; however, a number of disa-greements remained, including the scope of the draft convention, its relationship with other international legal instruments on international terrorism, the ques-tion of armed forces and armed conflicts, and the question of the legal definition of terrorism and its relationship to anti-colonial and liberation struggles. At the September meeting of the Sixth Committee Working Group, States agreed that broader consulta-tions were required to find an acceptable solution to the remaining issues concerning the scope of the convention. The Working Group was informed that while there appeared to be a willingness among dele-gations to continue work on the draft convention, it was determined that the time was not opportune for the convening of informal consultations during the Working Group. The Chairman appointed Ms. Cate Steains (Australia) to act as coordinator on the issue with a view to organizing open-ended informal con-sultations at the appropriate time. There were neither formal nor informal discussions on the draft convention during the 1999 Ad Hoc Committee and Working Group meetings. Their work in 1999 was dedicated entirely to the negotiation of the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. At the November meetings of the UN Sixth Commit-tee, some speakers favored the speedy completion of the work on the draft convention and its adoption. Concern was expressed regarding the limited progress achieved in the resolution of the outstanding issue of the scope of its application. A point was made that, taking into consideration the risks of nuc-lear terrorism, the outstanding issues related to the scope of the draft convention should be resolved as soon as possible; States were called upon to enhance efforts to overcome those remaining issues. Support was expressed for the position of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) members in this regard, namely that the scope of the draft convention be expanded to include the activities of State militaries. A reference was made to the need for the treaty to encompass State terrorism as well. The view was also expressed that a distinction should be drawn between the draft convention, as well as the issues raised by the Inter-national Court of Justice (ICJ) Advisory Opinion on Nuclear Weapons, and the use and possession of nuc-lear weapons by the NWS.</p><p>On 9 December, the UNGA adopted Resolution 54/100 entitled “Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,” which tasked the Ad Hoc Committee</p><p>NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/19/2010</p><p>with further elaborating the draft convention, as well as commencing consideration of a comprehensive convention dealing with international terrorism. 1998: The Ad Hoc Committee turned to the discus-sion of the draft convention at its second meeting in February. Addressing the meeting, the Russian Fed-eration said that the international community must establish effective measures to counter acts of nuclear terrorism, which could threaten global peace and se-curity and cause irreparable damage to the environ-ment. It said that depending on the circumstances of a criminal attack, it might fall under either the scope of the draft convention, the 1980 Physical Protection Convention, the 1997 Terrorist Bombing Convention, a combination of them, or all of them. During the deliberations, the substance of the draft text received general support from the States, but there was uncertainty on some specific details. States pointed out the following shortcomings of the draft convention and concerns:</p><p>? Its definitions were too broad and, at the same time, too narrow in scope.</p><p>? Its definitions should be brought into line with the language used in established international instru-ments.</p><p>? The draft convention’s relationship with existing legal instruments, i.e., the 1980 Physical Protec-tion Convention, the 1996 CTBT, and the 1997 Terrorist Bombing Convention must also be ex-amined in order to avoid possible overlap.</p><p>? The legal gaps should not necessarily be ad-dressed by a new instrument, rather they could be better addressed by strengthening the existing le-gal instruments, e.g., by drafting a protocol to the 1980 Physical Protection Convention.</p><p>? Provisions regarding jurisdiction, extradition, and legal assistance, similar to those contained in the 1997 Terrorist Bombing Convention, should be incorporated into the draft convention.</p><p>? The Ad Hoc Committee of the UN Sixth Commit-tee would not be the most appropriate forum for the discussion of the draft convention since the IAEA has the most competence on the issue of nuclear material.</p><p>? The draft convention should only deal with meas-ures to counter terrorism and not encompass pro-visions on the physical protection of nuclear ma-terial.</p><p>? The scope of the draft convention should be ex-panded to stress counter-terrorism and punish-ment.</p><p>? Special attention should be given to the problems of State terrorism.</p><p>? The draft convention could undermine the legal use of nuclear material; therefore, the definitions should be revised to specify that the acts in ques-tion were intentional and unlawful crimes.</p><p>? The coverage of the draft convention should be extended to the broadest possible range of ra-dioactive material, as well as nuclear facilities, explosives, and other devices, including measures to prevent unauthorized access to such material, to protect facilities from intrusion, and to develop more effective controls against illicit trafficking.</p><p>Speaking at the meeting, the IAEA Legal Advisor said that the draft convention’s definitions of “nuc-lear material” should be based on definitions con-tained in the 1963 Vienna Convention on Civil Lia-bility for Nuclear Damage, the 1980 Physical Protec-tion Convention, and a Draft Safety Guide on “Pre-venting, Detecting and Responding to Illicit Traffick-ing in Radioactive Materials.” Speaking on the over-lap between the draft convention and the 1980 con-vention, the IAEA representative said that the overlap regarding the crimes covered, coupled with differing jurisdictional provisions, could complicate their im-plementation and lead a Party to choose which in-strument to apply in a given case.</p><p>After the exchange of views, States identified three main points of discussion: definitions, relationship to existing instruments covering the same subject mat-ter, and scope of the draft convention. The Commit-tee carried out a first reading of substantive elements of the draft text. Upon the closure of the February meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee, States did not reach agreement on whether to create a new conven-tion on nuclear terrorism or amend the 1980 Physical Protection Convention. They also disagreed on the scope of the proposed convention. Some States pro-posed new articles that would safeguard the inaliena-ble right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and exempt the military activities of States in armed conflict or in exercise of their official duties from the scope of the draft convention. Regarding the issue of definitions, there was a general agreement that they should focus on combating terrorist acts. A number of delegations proposed additional para-graphs to the draft convention’s preamble. According to those paragraphs, the preamble would recognize the importance of a universally agreed definition of</p><p>NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION Inventory of International Nonproliferation Organizations and Regimes Center for Nonproliferation Studies Last Updated: 5/19/2010</p><p>international terrorism; recall UNGA resolutions on the importance of nuclear disarmament; emphasize the responsibility of a State for the establishment, implementation, and maintenance of a physical pro-tection system for nuclear material, devices, and in-stallations on its territory; stress the inherent right of all States to engage in research, production, and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes; and recall IAEA recommendations for physical protection of radioactive materials and facilities. Some speakers voiced concern about the difficulties that might arise if the return of stolen nuclear material was obligatory, because some States were legally precluded from returning nuclear components or products. Some del-egations stressed the need to take into account the role that the IAEA could play, while others felt IAEA could have more of a limited role. On 16 September, the UN Sixth Committee estab-lished a Working Group to follow up the work on elaborating the draft convention carried out by the Ad Hoc Committee at its February meeting. Between 28 September and 9 October, the Working Group con-ducted 13 meetings, during which the Group con-ducted informal consultations, reviewed proposals and amendments, and produced a revised text of the draft convention.</p><p>States noted that the revised text was generally ac-ceptable, however disagreement on certain provisions still existed, including the scope of application (Eu-ropean Union), activities of armed forces in armed conflict (NAM), extradition and prosecution, inclu-sion of nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) obli-gations (Pakistan) in the draft convention, the number of required ratifications (22) for the entry into force (Pakistan), and the legal definition of terrorism and its relationship to anti-colonial and liberation strug-gles. Group discussions reflected the need to conduct considerably more work on the provisions that are specific to nuclear terrorism. Some States expressed hope that the UNGA would be able to adopt the draft text by the end of 1998. However, others, including those belonging to the NAM, suggested that such action on the draft con-vention should be delayed pending further consulta-tions. Some States questioned the very approach the Ad Hoc Committee and the Working Group used to fulfill their mandate to establish a comprehensive legal anti-terrorism regime. They developed separate conventions concerned with different subject matter rather than a comprehensive convention on terrorism as required to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p><p>1997: The Ad Hoc Committee was primarily con-cerned with considering and adopting the text of the International Convention for the Suppression of Ter-rorist Bombing. On 19 November, after the UN Sixth Committee approved the draft text of this convention, it also reaffirmed, without a vote, the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee to continue its work on the elabo-ration of an International Convention for the Sup-pression of Nuclear Terrorism with the participation of the representatives of the IAEA.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.lawyersnjurists.com/legal-documentations-litigations/international-conventions-treaties/privet-international-law-conventions/outline-hague-intercountry-adoption-convention/attachment/outline33e/" rel="attachment wp-att-6244">OUTLINE HAGUE INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION CONVENTION(Full Text pdf File)<br/></a></p><p><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p><p><strong>The <em>Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption </em></strong></p><p><strong>Introduction </strong></p><p>Intercountry adoption is a relatively recent phenomenon. It expanded slowly after World War II, until the 1970s, when the numbers increased dramatically. By the 1980s, it was recognised that this phenomenon was creating serious and complex human and legal problems and the absence of existing domestic and international legal instruments indicated the need for a multilateral approach.<sup>1 </sup>It was in this context that the <em>Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption </em>was developed to establish safeguards which ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interest of the child and with respect for the child’s fundamental rights.</p><p>The Convention recognises that growing up in a family is of primary importance and is essential for the happiness and healthy development of the child. It also recognises that intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot be found is his or her Country of origin. By setting out clear procedures and prohibiting improper financial gain, the Convention provides greater security, predictability and transparency for all parties to the adoption, including prospective adoptive parents. The Convention also establishes a system of co-operation between authorities in countries of origin and receiving countries, designed to ensure that intercountry adoption takes place under conditions which help to guarantee the best adoption practices and elimination of abuses.</p><p>The 1993 Hague Convention gives effect to Article 21 of the <em>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</em><sup>2 </sup>by adding substantive safeguards and procedures to the broad principles and norms laid down in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 1993 Convention establishes minimum standards, but does not intend to serve as a uniform law of adoption. While making the rights and interests of the child paramount, it also respects and protects the rights of families of origin and adoptive families.</p><p>The Convention makes clear that Receiving States and States of origin must share the burdens and benefits of regulating intercountry adoptions. It sets out clearly which functions within the adoption process are to be performed by each State.</p><p><strong>Principal features of the Convention </strong></p><p><strong><em>The best interests of the child are paramount </em></strong></p><p>The Convention contains certain rules to ensure that adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights. For example, States, must: consider national solutions first (implement the principle of subsidiarity); ensure the child is adoptable; preserve information about the child and his/her parents; evaluate thoroughly the prospective adoptive parents; match the child with a suitable family; impose additional safeguards where needed. This fundamental principle of the child’s best interests should guide the development of an integrated national child care and protection system, of which one part is an ethical, child-centred approach to intercountry adoption.</p><p><sup>1 </sup><em>See </em>Explanatory Report to the <em>Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, </em>by G. Parra-Aranguren, at paragraph 6. Available on the Hague Conference website, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.hcc.net </span>under Intercountry Adoption Section/Explanatory Documents.</p><p><sup>2 </sup><em>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</em>, G.A. Res. 44/25, UN GAOR, 61<sup>st </sup>Plenary Meeting, Annex. Available at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.ohchr.org </span></p><p>Subsidiarity principle</p><p>‘Subsidiarity’ in the Convention means that Contracting States recognise that a child should be raised by his or her birth family or extended family whenever possible. If that is not possible or practicable, other forms of permanent care in the country of origin should be considered. Only after due consideration has been given to national solutions should intercountry adoption be considered, and then only if it is in the child’s best interests. As a general rule, institutional care should be considered as a last resort for a child in need of a family.</p><p>Safeguards to protect children from abduction, sale and trafficking</p><p>States should establish safeguards to prevent abduction, sale and trafficking in children for adoption by: protecting birth families from exploitation and undue pressure; ensuring only children in need of a family are adoptable and adopted; preventing improper financial gain and corruption; regulating agencies and individuals involved in adoptions by accrediting them in accordance with Convention standards.</p><p>Co-operation between States and within States</p><p>The Convention envisages a system in which all Contracting States work together to ensure the protection of children. Co-operation between Contracting States is essential to ensure the effectiveness of any safeguards put in place (Article 1 b)). In practice, this principle is implemented first through international co-operation between Central Authorities, and between other public authorities and accredited bodies performing the functions of Central Authorities (Article 7); second, through intra-State co-operation between authorities and agencies regarding Convention procedures (Article 7(1)); and third, through co-operation to prevent abuses and avoidance of the Convention (Article 33).</p><p>Automatic recognition of adoption decisions</p><p>The 1993 Convention achieved a major breakthrough in establishing a system of automatic recognition of adoptions made in accordance with the Convention. Every adoption, whether a simple or full adoption, which is certified to be made in accordance with Convention procedures, is recognised “by operation of law” in all other Contracting States (Article 23). In other words, the Convention gives immediate certainty to the status of the child, and eliminates the need for a procedure for recognition of orders, or re-adoption, in the receiving country.</p><p>Competent authorities, Central Authorities and Accredited Bodies</p><p>The Convention requires that only competent authorities should perform Convention functions. Competent authorities may be Central Authorities, public authorities including judicial or administrative authorities, and accredited bodies. The Convention provides for a system of Central Authorities in all Contracting States and imposes certain general obligations on them, such as: co-operation with one another through the exchange of general information concerning intercountry adoption; the elimination of any obstacles to the application of the Convention (Article 7(2) b)); and a responsibility to deter all practices contrary to the objects of the Convention (Article 8). Central Authorities also have specific obligations in Chapter IV in respect of individual adoptions.</p><p>Accredited Bodies may perform some of the functions of Central Authorities. The process of accreditation of bodies is one of the Convention’s safeguards to protect children in adoption. Any private adoption body or agency must be accountable to a supervising or accrediting authority (see Articles 6-13). They must play an effective role in upholding the principles of the Convention and preventing illegal and improper practices in adoption. If accredited bodies are to be used, the Convention sets out a regulatory framework of minimum standards for their operation in Articles 10, 11 and 32. Additional standards may be imposed by Contracting States.</p><p>September 2008 Page 2 of 3 September  2008 Page 3 of 3</p><p>Guide to Good Practice for the 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention</p><p>The Implementation and Operation of the 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention: A Guide to Good Practice is the 1st Guide to Good Practice for the 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention. The new Guide identifies important matters related to planning, establishing and operating the legal and administrative framework to implement the Convention. It will assist policy makers involved in short term and long term planning to implement the Convention in their country, as well as judges, lawyers, administrators, caseworkers, accredited bodies and other professionals needing guidance on some practical or legal aspects of implementing the Convention. An outline of the procedure for a Convention adoption is found in the Guide at Chapter 7.1. The Guide is on the Hague Conference website at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.hcch.net </span></p><p>The Intercountry Adoption Technical Assistance Programme (ICATAP)</p><p>In order for the 1993 Hague Convention to operate successfully, the initial steps necessary for its effective implementation in each Contracting State must be carefully planned. The Convention places heavy burdens of responsibility on States, and implementation and technical assistance may be particularly vital in some countries that have few resources available for this purpose. The ICATAP was designed to provide assistance directly to the governments of certain States which are planning ratification of, or accession to, the Convention, or which have ratified or acceded but are experiencing difficulties with implementation of the Convention. The ICATAP is operated directly by the Permanent Bureau, using staff and resources dedicated to this project, as well as international consultants and experts. The Hague approach takes full account of the need to integrate the intercountry adoption process within the broader child care and protection system.

While it prohibits the use of such weapons, it does not prohibit their production, development, and stockpiling, gaps cov-ered by later treaties such as the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). There is no verification mechanism contained within the Geneva Protocol and compliance is voluntary. The Geneva Protocol, implicitly, does not cover in-ternal or civil conflicts. Moreover, a sizeable fraction of its parties have reserved a right to retaliate in kind if chemical and/or biological weapons should ever be used against them by enemies or allies of enemies. This, and the contractual character of the Protocol, has rendered it a no-first-use agreement. <strong>Background: </strong>The Geneva Protocol of 1925 was drawn up and signed at the Conference for the Super-vision of the International Trade in Arms and Am-munition, which was held in Geneva under the aus-pices of the League  of Nations from 4 May to 17 June 1925. The conference adopted a Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms, Munitions and Implements of War, which has not entered into force and, as a separate document, a Pro-tocol on the use of gases. The earlier treaties prohibit-ing the use of gases to which the Protocol refers are in particular the Hague Declaration concerning as-phyxiating gases of 1899 and the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. Responding to the extensive use of chemical weapons between belligerents in the Iran-Iraq War and the increasing number of chemical weapon-capable states, a Conference on Chemical Weapons Use was held in Paris in January 1989. At the conference the States recognized the importance of the Geneva Pro-tocol, reaffirmed the prohibitions as established in it, and called upon all States which had not yet done so to accede to the Protocol.</p><p>The Protocol provided the basis for the BTWC and the 1993 CWC as well as some regional arms control agreements. <strong>Reservations: </strong>Upon ratification or accession to the Protocol, some States declared that the provisions of the Protocol would cease to be binding on them if their enemies, or the allies of their enemies, failed to respect the prohibitions of the Protocol. In recent years, however, many of the reservations have been withdrawn, especially following the entry into force of the BTWC and the CWC. Countries that continue to hold reservations to the Protocol include: Algeria, Angola, Bahrain, Bangla-desh, Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Iraq, Israel, Jor-dan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Repub-lic of Korea, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Solomon Islands, Syria, Thailand, the United States, and Viet Nam.</p></div></div>

<div class="entry-content"><div class="featured-thumb"><a href="#"></a></div><div class="entry-content"><p>Tlat-1 TREATY FOR THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (TREATY OF TLATELOLCO)Opened for Signature: 14 February 1967 Entered into Force: 25 April 1969. Number of Signatories: 33 states. Number of Ratifications: 33 states. Duration: The treaty is of a permanent nature and shall remain in force indefinitely. Treaty Text On 23 October 2002, the Tlatelolco Treaty came into full force throughout the region when Cuba, the only state which had not ratified the treaty, deposited its instrument of ratification. Currently, all 33 states in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean have signed and ratified the treaty. The Tlatelolco Treaty has served as a model for all future nuclear-weapon-free zone (NWFZ) agreements. Background: Costa Rica was the first regional state to propose a Latin American nuclear arms control arrangement at an Organization for the American States (OAS) Council meeting in 1958, which sought to prevent the manufacture of nuclear arms or their acquisition from the nuclear weapon states (NWS). Other proposals were unsuccessfully floated within the OAS context during 1958-1960. French nuclear weapon testing in the Sahara in 1960, together with the South African apartheid regime’s interest in nuclear arms, led the African states to is-sue a call for an African NWFZ, which was endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 1961. Alone among Latin American states, Brazil supported the African NWFZ resolution and proposed a similar zone within its region. The efforts of Alfonso Garcia Robles, as Mexican ambassador to Brazil, eventually led, in March 1963, to Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador joining Mexico in supporting a Latin American NWFZ. Treaty Obligations: The treaty aims to prohibit and prevent in the region: (a) the testing, use, manufac-ture, production, or acquisition by any means what-soever of any nuclear weapons, by the Parties them-selves, directly or indirectly, on behalf of anyone else, or in any other way, and (b) the receipt, storage, installation, deployment, and any form of possession of any nuclear weapons, directly or indirectly, by the Parties themselves, by anyone on their behalf, or in any other way. The Parties also undertake to refrain from engaging in encouraging or authorizing, directly or indirectly, or in any way participating in the test-ing, use, manufacture, production, possession, or control of any nuclear weapons. Treaty Zone: The treaty covers the region and large sectors of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Verification and Compliance: Verification: Verification is accomplished by con-cluding multilateral or bilateral agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the application of its safeguards to nuclear activities of States Parties to the treaty. In addition, the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (OPANAL) is an inter-governmental agency created by the Treaty of Tlate-lolco to ensure that the obligations of the treaty are met.. Compliance: The General Conference, the supreme organ of the OPANAL agency, will take note of all cases in which any Contracting Party is not comply-ing fully with its obligations under this treaty and shall draw the matter to the attention of the Party concerned, making such recommendations as it deems appropriate. If such non-compliance consti-tutes a violation of this treaty which might endanger peace and security, the General Conference may re-port simultaneously to the United Nations Security Council and the General Assembly through the Sec-retary-General of the United Nations, and to the Council of the Organization of American States. The General Conference shall likewise report to the IAEA for such purposes as are relevant in accordance with its Statute. Additional Protocol I provides for the application of the status of denuclearization in territories for which, de jure or de facto, France, the Netherlands, the Unit-ed Kingdom, and the United States are internationally responsible, and which lie within the limits of the geographic zone established by the treaty. All four states have acceded to Protocol I.

Ratified: France on 24 Au-gust 1992, the Netherlands on 26 July 1971, United Kingdom on 11 December 1969, and United States on 23 November 1981. Additional Protocol II obliges all NWS to respect the status of denuclearization of the relevant geo-graphic zone and commits them not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against parties to the treaty. All five NWS acceded to the protocol. Ratified: France on 22 March 1974, China on 2 June 1974, United Kingdom on 11 December 1969, United States on 12 May 1971, and USSR on 8 January 1979. Developments: 2008: On 8 February, the Organization of American States Permanent Council’s Committee on Hemis-pheric Security convened in special session to con-sider OAS progress with respect to initiatives on the CTBT and related instruments. The session re-ceived briefings from the OPANAL, CTBTO, and UNODA, and reaffirmed the OAS commitment to the Western Hemisphere as a nuclear weapons free-zone and stressed its support for the CTBT. 2007: On 14 February, members of the Treaty of Tlatelolco met in Mexico City to celebrate the Trea-ty’s 40th anniversary. On 28 June, OPANAL adopted resolution C/Res.43 on procedural issues relating to the resignation of Secretary General Edmundo Vargas Carreno. The OPANAL council resolved to assume the duties of the Secretary General until a new one is elected. 2006: On 11 September, OPANAL adopted resolu-tion C/Res.41. The resolution welcomed the estab-lishment of the Central Asian Nuclear-WeaponsFree Zone and instructed the Secretary General to congra-tulate the relevant republics on its behalf.

The General Assembly of the United Nations, by its resolution 39/141 of 14 December</p><p>1984, requested the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, “taking into</p><p>consideration Article 62, paragraph 3, and Article 66, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the</p><p>United Nations and Council resolution 9 (1) of 16  February 1946, to request the Commission</p><p>on Narcotic Drugs to initiate at its thirty-first session, to be held in February 1985, as a matter</p><p>of priority, the preparation of a draft convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs which</p><p>considers the various aspects of the problem as a whole and, in particular, those not</p><p>envisaged in existing international instruments . . .”.</p><p>2. In furtherance of the foregoing request, and the follow-up action by the Commission on</p><p>Narcotic Drugs and the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General of the United</p><p>Nations prepared the initial text of a draft Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs</p><p>and Psychotropic Substances. On the basis of the comments made thereon by Governments</p><p>and the deliberations of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on that draft at its thirty-second</p><p>session in 1987, the Secretary-General prepared a consolidated working document, which</p><p>was circulated to all Governments in April 1987 and was considered at two sessions of an</p><p>open-ended intergovernmental expert group. On 7  December 1987, the General Assembly</p><p>adopted resolution 42/111, which gave further instructions for advancing the preparation of</p><p>the draft Convention. As the time available to the expert group had not permitted thorough</p><p>consideration of all the articles, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to</p><p>consider convening a further intergovernmental expert group, meeting for two weeks</p><p>immediately prior to the tenth special session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in</p><p>February 1988, to continue revision of the working document on the draft Convention against</p><p>Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and, if possible, to reach</p><p>agreement on the Convention. At its tenth special session, held at Vienna from 8 to 19</p><p>February 1988, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs reviewed the text of the draft Convention</p><p>and decided that certain articles thereof should be referred to the Conference to be convened</p><p>to adopt a Convention. The Commission also recommended certain means to the Economic</p><p>and Social Council to further the preparation of the draft Convention.</p><p>3. The Economic and Social Council, by its resolution 1988/8 of 25 May 1988, having recalled</p><p>the preparatory work undertaken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 39/141 by the</p><p>competent United Nations organs, decided “to convene, in accordance with Article 62,</p><p>paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations and within the provisions of General</p><p>Assembly resolution 366 (IV) of 3 December 1949, a conference of plenipotentiaries for the</p><p>adoption of a convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances”.</p><p>By its decision 1988/120, also adopted on 25 May  1988, the Council decided that the</p><p>Conference should be held at Vienna from 25 November to 20 December 1988 and that the</p><p>Secretary-General should send invitations to participate in the Conference to those who had</p><p>been invited to participate in the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit</p><p>Trafficking, held at Vienna from 17 to 26 June 1987.</p><p>4. By its resolution 1988/8, the Economic and Social Council also decided to convene a</p><p>review group for the Conference to review the draft texts of certain articles and the draft</p><p>Convention as a whole to achieve overall consistency in the text to be submitted to the</p><p>Conference. The Review Group on the draft Convention met at the United Nations Office at</p><p>Vienna from 27 June to 8 July 1988 and adopted a report to the Conference (E/CONF.82/3).</p><p>5. The United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Convention against Illicit Traffic in</p><p>Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances met at the Neue Hofburg at Vienna from 25</p><p>November to 20 December 1988.</p><p>6.

This article shall apply to the offences established by the Parties in accordance with article 3,</p><p>paragraph 1.</p><p>2. Each of the offences to which this article applies shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable</p><p>offence in any extradition treaty existing between Parties. The Parties undertake to include such offences</p><p>as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.</p><p>3. If a Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for</p><p>extradition from another Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention as</p><p>the legal basis for extradition in respect of any offence to which this article applies. The Parties which</p><p>require detailed legislation in order to use this Convention as a legal basis for extradition shall consider</p><p>enacting such legislation as may be necessary.</p><p>4. The Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize</p><p>offences to which this article applies as extraditable offences between themselves.</p><p>5. Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the law of the requested Party or by</p><p>applicable extradition treaties, including the grounds upon which the requested Party may refuse</p><p>extradition.</p><p>6. In considering requests received pursuant to this article, the requested State may refuse to comply</p><p>with such requests where there are substantial grounds leading its judicial or other competent authorities</p><p>to believe that compliance would facilitate the prosecution or punishment of any person on account of his</p><p>race, religion, nationality or political opinions, or would cause prejudice for any of those reasons to any</p><p>person affected by the request.</p><p>7. The Parties shall endeavour to expedite extradition procedures and to simplify evidentiary</p><p>requirements relating thereto in respect of any offence to which this article applies.</p><p>8. Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition treaties, the requested Party may,</p><p>upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and are urgent, and at the request of the</p><p>requesting Party, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present in its territory into</p><p>custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his presence at extradition proceedings.</p><p>7</p><p>9. Without prejudice to the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established in accordance with its</p><p>domestic law, a Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found shall:</p><p>a) If it does not extradite him in respect of an offence established in accordance with</p><p>article 3, paragraph l, on the grounds set forth in article 4, paragraph 2, subparagraph a),</p><p>submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution, unless otherwise</p><p>agreed with the requesting Party;</p><p>b) If it does not extradite him in respect of such an offence and has established its</p><p>jurisdiction in relation to that offence in accordance with article 4, paragraph 2,</p><p>subparagraph b), submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of</p><p>prosecution, unless otherwise requested by the requesting Party for the purposes of</p><p>preserving its legitimate jurisdiction.</p><p>10. If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused because the person sought is</p><p>a national of the requested Party, the requested Party shall, if its law so permits and in conformity with</p><p>the requirements of such law, upon application of the requesting Party, consider, the enforcement of the</p><p>sentence which has been imposed under the law of the requesting Party, or the remainder thereof.</p><p>11. The Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements to carry out or to enhance</p><p>the effectiveness of extradition.</p><p>12. The Parties may consider entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements, whether <em>ad hoc </em>or</p><p>general, on the transfer to their country of persons sentenced to imprisonment and other forms of</p><p>deprivation of liberty for offences to which this article applies, in order that they may complete their</p><p>sentences there.</p><p><em>Article 7</em></p><p>MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE</p><p>1. The Parties shall afford one another, pursuant to this article, the widest measure of mutual legal</p><p>assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to criminal offences</p><p>established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1.</p><p>2. Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article may be requested for any of</p><p>the following purposes:</p><p>a) Taking evidence or statements from persons;</p><p>b) Effecting service of judicial documents;</p><p>c) Executing searches and seizures;</p><p>d) Examining objects and sites;</p><p>e) Providing information and evidentiary items;</p><p>f) Providing originals or certified copies of relevant documents and records, including</p><p>bank, financial, corporate or business records;</p><p>g) Identifying or tracing proceeds, property, instrumentalities or other things for</p><p>evidentiary purposes.</p><p>3. The Parties may afford one another any other forms of mutual legal assistance allowed by the</p><p>domestic law of the requested Party.</p><p>4. Upon request, the Parties shall facilitate or encourage, to the extent consistent with their domestic</p><p>law and practice, the presence or availability of persons, including persons in custody, who consent to</p><p>assist in investigations or participate in proceedings.</p><p>5. A Party shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance under this article on the ground of bank</p><p>secrecy.</p><p>6. The provisions of this article shall not affect the obligations under any other treaty, bilateral or</p><p>multilateral, which governs or will govern, in whole or in part, mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.</p><p>7. Paragraphs 8 to 19 of this article shall apply to requests made pursuant to this article if the Parties</p><p>in question are not bound by a treaty of mutual legal assistance. If these Parties are bound by such a</p><p>treaty, the corresponding provisions of that treaty shall apply unless the Parties agree to apply</p><p>paragraphs 8 to 19 of this article in lieu thereof.</p><p>8</p><p>8. Parties shall designate an authority, or when necessary authorities, which shall have the</p><p>responsibility and power to execute requests for mutual legal assistance or to transmit them to the</p><p>competent authorities for execution. The authority or the authorities designated for this purpose shall be</p><p>notified to the Secretary-General. Transmission of requests for mutual legal assistance and any</p><p>communication related thereto shall be effected between the authorities designated by the Parties; this</p><p>requirement shall be without prejudice to the right of a Party to require that such requests and</p><p>communications be addressed to it through the diplomatic channel and, in urgent circumstances, where</p><p>the Parties agree, through channels of the International Criminal Police Organization, if possible.</p><p>9. Requests shall be made in writing in a language acceptable to the requested Party. The language</p><p>or languages acceptable to each Party shall be notified to the Secretary-General. In urgent</p><p>circumstances, and where agreed by the Parties, requests may be made orally, but shall be confirmed in</p><p>writing forthwith.</p><p>10. A request for mutual legal assistance shall contain:</p><p>a) The identity of the authority making the request;</p><p>b) The subject matter and nature of the investigation, prosecution or proceeding to which</p><p>the request relates, and the name and the functions of the authority conducting such</p><p>investigation, prosecution or proceeding;</p><p>c) A summary of the relevant facts, except in respect of requests for the purpose of</p><p>service of judicial documents;</p><p>d) A description of the assistance sought and details of any particular procedure the</p><p>requesting Party wishes to be followed;</p><p>e) Where possible, the identity, location and nationality of any person concerned;</p><p>f) The purpose for which the evidence, information or action is sought.</p><p>11. The requested Party may request additional information when it appears necessary for the</p><p>execution of the request in accordance with its domestic law or when it can facilitate such execution.</p><p>12. A request shall be executed in accordance with the domestic law of the requested Party and, to the</p><p>extent not contrary to the domestic law of the requested Party and where possible, in accordance with</p><p>the procedures specified in the request.</p><p>13. The requesting Party shall not transmit nor use information or evidence furnished by the requested</p><p>Party for investigations, prosecutions or proceedings other than those stated in the request without the</p><p>prior consent of the requested Party.</p><p>14. The requesting Party may require that the requested Party keep confidential the fact and substance</p><p>of the request, except to the extent necessary to execute the request. If the requested Party cannot</p><p>comply with the requirement of confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting Party.</p><p>15. Mutual legal assistance may be refused:</p><p>a) If the request is not made in conformity with the provisions of this article;</p><p>b) If the requested Party considers that execution of the request is likely to prejudice its</p><p>sovereignty, security, ordre public or other essential interests;</p><p>c) If the authorities of the requested Party would be prohibited by its domestic law from</p><p>carrying out the action requested with regard to any similar offence, had it been subject to</p><p>investigation, prosecution or proceedings under their own jurisdiction;</p><p>d) If it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested Party relating to mutual</p><p>legal assistance for the request to be granted.</p><p>16. Reasons shall be given for any refusal of mutual legal assistance.</p><p>17. Mutual legal assistance may be postponed by the requested Party on the ground that it interferes</p><p>with an ongoing investigation, prosecution or proceeding. In such a case, the requested Party shall</p><p>consult with the requesting Party to determine if the assistance can still be given subject to such terms</p><p>and conditions as the requested Party deems necessary.</p><p>18. A witness, expert or other person who consents to give evidence in a proceeding or to assist in an</p><p>investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding in the territory of the requesting Party, shall not be</p><p>prosecuted, detained, punished or subjected to any other restriction of his personal liberty in that</p><p>territory in respect of acts, omissions or convictions prior to his departure from the territory of the</p><p>requested Party. Such safe conduct shall cease when the witness, expert or other person having had, for</p><p>a period of fifteen consecutive days, or for any period agreed upon by the Parties, from the date on which</p><p>9</p><p>he has been officially informed that his presence is no longer required by the judicial authorities, an</p><p>opportunity of leaving, has nevertheless remained voluntarily in the territory or, having left it, has</p><p>returned of his own free will.</p><p>19.

If crime crosses borders, so must law enforcement. If the rule of</p><p>law is undermined not only in one country, but in many, then those who</p><p>defend it cannot limit themselves to purely national means. If the enemies of</p><p>progress and human rights seek to exploit the openness and opportunities of</p><p>globalization for their purposes, then we must exploit those very same factors to</p><p>defend human rights and defeat the forces of crime, corruption and trafficking</p><p>in human beings.</p><p>One of the starkest contrasts in our world today is the gulf that exists</p><p>between the civil and the uncivil. By “civil” I mean civilization: the accumulated</p><p>centuries of learning that form our foundation for progress. By “civil” I also</p><p>mean tolerance: the pluralism and respect with which we accept and draw</p><p>strength from the world’s diverse peoples. And finally, I mean civil society: the</p><p>citizens’ groups, businesses, unions, professors, journalists, political parties and</p><p>others who have an essential role to play in the running of any society.</p><p>Arrayed against these constructive forces, however, in ever greater numbers</p><p>and with ever stronger weapons, are the forces of what I call “uncivil society”.</p><p>They are terrorists, criminals, drug dealers, traffickers in people and others who</p><p>undo the good works of civil society. They take advantage of the open borders,</p><p>free markets and technological advances that bring so many benefits to the</p><p>world’s people. They thrive in countries with weak institutions, and they show</p><p>no scruple about resorting to intimidation or violence. Their ruthlessness is the</p><p>very antithesis of all we regard as civil. They are powerful, representing entrenched</p><p>interests and the clout of a global enterprise worth billions of dollars,</p><p>but they are not invincible.</p><p>The Millennium Declaration adopted by the Heads of State meeting at the</p><p>United Nations in September 2000 reaffirmed the principles underlying our</p><p>efforts and should serve to encourage all who struggle for the rule of law. The</p><p>Declaration states that “men and women have the right to live their lives and</p><p>raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence,</p><p>oppression or injustice”.</p><p>At the Millennium Summit, world leaders proclaimed freedom—from fear</p><p>and from want—as one of the essential values in the twenty-first century. Yet</p><p>the right to live in dignity, free from fear and want, is still denied to millions</p><p>iv</p><p>of people around the world. It is denied to the child who is working as an</p><p>indentured labourer in a sweatshop; to the father who must pay a bribe to get</p><p>medical care for his son or daughter; to the woman who is condemned to a life</p><p>of forced prostitution.</p><p>I believe the trafficking of persons, particularly women and children, for</p><p>forced and exploitative labour, including for sexual exploitation, is one of the</p><p>most egregious violations of human rights that the United Nations now confronts.</p><p>It is widespread and growing. It is rooted in social and economic conditions</p><p>in the countries from which the victims come, facilitated by practices that</p><p>discriminate against women and driven by cruel indifference to human suffering</p><p>on the part of those who exploit the services that the victims are forced to</p><p>provide. The fate of these most vulnerable people in our world is an affront to</p><p>human dignity and a challenge to every State, every people and every community.</p><p>I therefore urge the Member States to ratify not only the United Nations</p><p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, but also the Protocol to</p><p>Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and</p><p>Children, which can make a real difference in the struggle to eliminate this</p><p>reprehensible trade in human beings.</p><p>Criminal groups have wasted no time in embracing today’s globalized</p><p>economy and the sophisticated technology that goes with it. But our efforts to</p><p>combat them have remained up to now very fragmented and our weapons</p><p>almost obsolete. The Convention gives us a new tool to address the scourge of</p><p>crime as a global problem. With enhanced international cooperation, we can</p><p>have a real impact on the ability of international criminals to operate successfully</p><p>and can help citizens everywhere in their often bitter struggle for safety and</p><p>dignity in their homes and communities.</p><p>The signing of the Convention in Palermo in December 2000 was a watershed</p><p>event in the reinforcement of our fight against organized crime. I urge all</p><p>States to ratify the Convention and the Protocols thereto at the earliest possible</p><p>date and to bring these instruments into force as a matter of urgency.</p><p><em>Kofi A.

fauna, offences against cultural heritage and</p><p>the growing links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes,</p><p>1. <em>Takes note </em>of the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on

Trafficking in Firearms,</p><p>Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the</p><p>United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime;</p><p>5. <em>Requests </em>the Ad Hoc

<em>Calls upon </em>all States to recognize the links between transnational organized</p><p>criminal activities and acts of terrorism, taking into account the relevant</p><p>General Assembly resolutions, and to apply the United Nations Convention</p><p>against Transnational Organized Crime in combating all forms of criminal</p><p>activity, as provided therein;</p><p>7. <em>Recommends </em>that the Ad Hoc Committee established by the General</p><p>Assembly in its resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, which is beginning its</p><p>deliberations with a view to developing a comprehensive convention on international</p><p>terrorism, pursuant to resolution 54/110 of 9 December 1999, should</p><p>take into consideration the provisions of the United Nations

Transnational Organized Crime and</p><p>the protocols thereto as soon as possible in order to ensure the speedy entry into</p><p>force of the Convention and the protocols thereto;</p><p>9. <em>Decides </em>that, until the Conference of the Parties to the Convention</p><p>established pursuant to the United Nations Convention against Transnational</p><p>Organized Crime decides otherwise, the account referred to in article 30 of the</p><p>Convention will be operated within the United Nations Crime Prevention and</p><p>Criminal Justice Fund, and encourages Member States to begin making</p><p>adequate voluntary contributions to the above-mentioned account for the</p><p>4</p><p>provision to developing countries and countries with economies in transition of</p><p>the technical assistance that they might require for implementation of the Convention</p><p>and the protocols thereto, including for the preparatory measures</p><p>needed for that implementation;</p><p>10. <em>Decides also </em>that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of a</p><p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime will complete its tasks</p><p>arising from the elaboration of the United Nations Convention against</p><p>Transnational Organized Crime by holding a meeting well before the convening</p><p>of the first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, in order</p><p>to prepare the draft text of the rules of procedure for the Conference of the</p><p>Parties and other rules and mechanisms described in article 32 of the Convention,</p><p>which will be communicated to the Conference of the Parties at its first</p><p>session for consideration and action;</p><p>11. <em>Requests </em>the Secretary-General to designate the Centre for International</p><p>Crime Prevention of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and</p><p>Crime Prevention to serve as the secretariat for the Conference of the Parties to</p><p>the Convention in accordance with article 33 of the Convention;</p><p>12. <em>Also requests </em>the Secretary-General to provide the Centre for International</p><p>Crime Prevention with the resources necessary to enable it to promote in</p><p>an effective manner the expeditious entry into force of the United Nations</p><p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and to discharge the functions</p><p>of

States Parties shall consider implementing feasible measures to detect</p><p>and monitor the movement of cash and appropriate negotiable instruments</p><p>across their borders, subject to safeguards to ensure proper use of information</p><p>and without impeding in any way the movement of legitimate capital.

In addition to the measures set forth in article 8 of this Convention,</p><p>each State Party shall, to the extent appropriate and consistent with its legal</p><p>11</p><p>system, adopt legislative, administrative or other effective measures to promote</p><p>integrity and to prevent, detect and punish the corruption of public officials.</p><p>2. Each State Party shall take measures to ensure effective action by its</p><p>authorities in the prevention, detection and punishment of the corruption of</p><p>public officials, including providing such authorities with adequate independence</p><p>to deter the exertion of inappropriate influence on their actions.</p><p><em>Article 10. Liability of legal persons</em></p><p>1. Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary, consistent</p><p>with its legal principles, to establish the liability of legal persons for</p><p>participation in serious crimes involving an organized criminal group and for</p><p>the offences established in accordance with articles 5, 6, 8 and 23 of this</p><p>Convention.</p><p>2. Subject to the legal principles of the State Party, the liability of legal</p><p>persons may be criminal, civil or administrative.</p><p>3. Such liability shall be without prejudice to the criminal liability of the</p><p>natural persons who have committed the offences.</p><p>4. Each State Party shall, in particular, ensure that legal persons held</p><p>liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective, proportionate and</p><p>dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions, including monetary sanctions.</p><p><em>Article 11. Prosecution, adjudication and sanctions</em></p><p>1. Each State Party shall make the commission of an offence established</p><p>in accordance with articles 5, 6, 8 and 23 of this Convention liable to sanctions</p><p>that take into account the gravity of that offence.</p><p>2.

In the case of offences established in accordance with articles 5, 6, 8</p><p>and 23 of this Convention, each State Party shall take appropriate measures, in</p><p>accordance with its domestic law and with due regard to the rights of the</p><p>defence, to seek to ensure that conditions imposed in connection with decisions</p><p>on release pending trial or appeal take into consideration the need to ensure the</p><p>presence of the defendant at subsequent criminal proceedings.</p><p>12</p><p>4. Each State Party shall ensure that its courts or other competent</p><p>authorities bear in mind the grave nature of the offences covered by this Convention</p><p>when considering the eventuality of early release or parole of persons</p><p>convicted of such offences.</p><p>5. Each State Party shall, where appropriate, establish under its domestic</p><p>law a long statute of limitations period in which to commence proceedings for</p><p>any offence covered by this Convention and a longer period where the alleged</p><p>offender has evaded the administration of justice.</p><p>6. Nothing contained in this Convention shall affect the principle that</p><p>the description of the offences established in accordance with this Convention</p><p>and of the applicable legal defences or other legal principles controlling the</p><p>lawfulness of conduct is reserved to the domestic law of a State Party and that</p><p>such offences shall be prosecuted and punished in accordance with that law.</p><p><em>Article 12. Confiscation and seizure</em></p><p>1. States Parties shall adopt, to the greatest extent possible within their</p><p>domestic legal systems, such measures as may be necessary to enable confiscation</p><p>of:</p><p><em>(a) </em>Proceeds of crime derived from offences covered by this Convention</p><p>or property the value of which corresponds to that of such proceeds;</p><p><em>(b) </em>Property, equipment or other instrumentalities used in or destined for</p><p>use in offences covered by this Convention.</p><p>2. States Parties shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to enable</p><p>the identification, tracing, freezing or seizure of any item referred to in paragraph</p><p>1 of this article for the purpose of eventual confiscation.</p><p>3. If proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted, in part or</p><p>in full, into other property, such property shall be liable to the measures referred</p><p>to in this article instead of the proceeds.</p><p>4. If proceeds of crime have been intermingled with property acquired</p><p>from legitimate sources, such property shall, without prejudice to any powers</p><p>relating to freezing or seizure, be liable to confiscation up to the assessed value</p><p>of the intermingled proceeds.</p><p>5. Income or other benefits derived from proceeds of crime, from</p><p>property into which proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted or</p><p>from property with which proceeds of crime have been intermingled shall also</p><p>13</p><p>be liable to the measures referred to in this article, in the same manner and to</p><p>the same extent as proceeds of crime.</p><p>6. For the purposes of this article and article 13 of this Convention, each</p><p>State Party shall empower its courts or other competent authorities to order that</p><p>bank, financial or commercial records be made available or be seized. States</p><p>Parties shall not decline to act under the provisions of this paragraph on the</p><p>ground of bank secrecy.</p><p>7. States Parties may consider the possibility of requiring that an offender</p><p>demonstrate the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other</p><p>property liable to confiscation, to the extent that such a requirement is consistent</p><p>with the principles of their domestic law and with the nature of the judicial</p><p>and other proceedings.</p><p>8. The provisions of this article shall not be construed to prejudice the</p><p>rights of bona fide third parties.</p><p>9. Nothing contained in this article shall affect the principle that the</p><p>measures to which it refers shall be defined and implemented in accordance</p><p>with and subject to the provisions of the domestic law of a State Party.</p><p><em>Article 13. International cooperation for purposes of confiscation</em></p><p>1.

The provisions of article 18 of this Convention are applicable, mutatis</p><p>mutandis, to this article. In addition to the information specified in article 18,</p><p>paragraph 15, requests made pursuant to this article shall contain:</p><p><em>(a) </em>In the case of a request pertaining to paragraph 1 <em>(a) </em>of this article,</p><p>a description of the property to be confiscated and a statement of the facts relied</p><p>upon by the requesting State Party sufficient to enable the requested State Party</p><p>to seek the order under its domestic law;</p><p><em>(b) </em>In the case of a request pertaining to paragraph 1 <em>(b) </em>of this article,</p><p>a legally admissible copy of an order of confiscation upon which the request is</p><p>based issued by the requesting State Party, a statement of the facts and information</p><p>as to the extent to which execution of the order is requested;</p><p><em>(c) </em>In the case of a request pertaining to paragraph 2 of this article, a</p><p>statement of the facts relied upon by the requesting State Party and a description</p><p>of the actions requested.</p><p>4.

Cooperation under this article may be refused by a State Party if</p><p>the offence to which the request relates is not an offence covered by this</p><p>Convention.</p><p>8. The provisions of this article shall not be construed to prejudice the</p><p>rights of bona fide third parties.</p><p>15</p><p>9. States Parties shall consider concluding bilateral or multilateral</p><p>treaties, agreements or arrangements to enhance the effectiveness of international</p><p>cooperation undertaken pursuant to this article.</p><p><em>Article 14. Disposal of confiscated proceeds of crime or property</em></p><p>1. Proceeds of crime or property confiscated by a State Party pursuant</p><p>to articles 12 or 13, paragraph 1, of this Convention shall be disposed of by that</p><p>State Party in accordance with its domestic law and administrative procedures.</p><p>2. When acting on the request made by another State Party in accordance</p><p>with article 13 of this Convention, States Parties shall, to the extent permitted</p><p>by domestic law and if so requested, give priority consideration to returning</p><p>the confiscated proceeds of crime or property to the requesting State</p><p>Party so that it can give compensation to the victims of the crime or return such</p><p>proceeds of crime or property to their legitimate owners.</p><p>3. When acting on the request made by another State Party in accordance</p><p>with articles 12 and 13 of this Convention, a State Party may give special</p><p>consideration to concluding agreements or arrangements on:</p><p><em>(a) </em>Contributing the value of such proceeds of crime or property or funds</p><p>derived from the sale of such proceeds of crime or property or a part thereof</p><p>to the account designated in accordance with article 30, paragraph 2 <em>(c), </em>of this</p><p>Convention and to intergovernmental bodies specializing in the fight against</p><p>organized crime;</p><p><em>(b) </em>Sharing with other States Parties, on a regular or case-by-case basis,</p><p>such proceeds of crime or property, or funds derived from the sale of such</p><p>proceeds of crime or property, in accordance with its domestic law or administrative</p><p>procedures.</p><p><em>Article 15. Jurisdiction</em></p><p>1. Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to</p><p>establish its jurisdiction over the offences established in accordance with</p><p>articles 5, 6, 8 and 23 of this Convention when:</p><p><em>(a) </em>The offence is committed in the territory of that State Party; or</p><p><em>(b) </em>The offence is committed on board a vessel that is flying the flag of</p><p>that State Party or an aircraft that is registered under the laws of that State Party</p><p>at the time that the offence is committed.</p><p>16</p><p>2. Subject to article 4 of this Convention, a State Party may also establish</p><p>its jurisdiction over any such offence when:</p><p><em>(a) </em>The offence is committed against a national of that State Party;</p><p><em>(b) </em>The offence is committed by a national of that State Party or a stateless</p><p>person who has his or her habitual residence in its territory; or</p><p><em>(c) </em>The offence is:</p><p>(i) One of those established in accordance with article 5, paragraph</p><p>1, of this Convention and is committed outside its territory</p><p>with a view to the commission of a serious crime within its</p><p>territory;</p><p>(ii) One of those established in accordance with article 6, paragraph</p><p>1 <em>(b) </em>(ii), of this Convention and is committed outside its</p><p>territory with a view to the commission of an offence established</p><p>in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1 <em>(a) </em>(i) or (ii) or <em>(b) </em>(i),</p><p>of this Convention within its territory.</p><p>3. For the purposes of article 16, paragraph 10, of this Convention, each</p><p>State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction</p><p>over the offences covered by this Convention when the alleged offender</p><p>is present in its territory and it does not extradite such person solely on the</p><p>ground that he or she is one of its nationals.</p><p>4. Each State Party may also adopt such measures as may be necessary to</p><p>establish its jurisdiction over the offences covered by this Convention when the</p><p>alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite him or her.</p><p>5. If a State Party exercising its jurisdiction under paragraph 1 or 2 of</p><p>this article has been notified, or has otherwise learned, that one or more other</p><p>States Parties are conducting an investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding</p><p>in respect of the same conduct, the competent authorities of those States</p><p>Parties shall, as appropriate, consult one another with a view to coordinating</p><p>their actions.</p><p>6. Without prejudice to norms of general international law, this Convention</p><p>does not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by</p><p>a State Party in accordance with its domestic law.</p><p><em>Article 16. Extradition</em></p><p>1. This article shall apply to the offences covered by this Convention or</p><p>in cases where an offence referred to in article 3, paragraph 1 <em>(a) </em>or <em>(b), </em>involves</p><p>17</p><p>an organized criminal group and the person who is the subject of the request</p><p>for extradition is located in the territory of the requested State Party, provided</p><p>that the offence for which extradition is sought is punishable under the domestic</p><p>law of both the requesting State Party and the requested State Party.</p><p>2. If the request for extradition includes several separate serious crimes,</p><p>some of which are not covered by this article, the requested State Party may</p><p>apply this article also in respect of the latter offences.</p><p>3. Each of the offences to which this article applies shall be deemed to</p><p>be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between</p><p>States Parties. States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable</p><p>offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them.</p><p>4. If a State Party that makes extradition conditional on the existence of</p><p>a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which</p><p>it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention the legal basis for</p><p>extradition in respect of any offence to which this article applies.</p><p>5. States Parties that make extradition conditional on the existence of a</p><p>treaty shall:</p><p><em>(a) </em>At the time of deposit of their instrument of ratification, acceptance,</p><p>approval of or accession to this Convention, inform the Secretary-General of the</p><p>United Nations whether they will take this Convention as the legal basis for</p><p>cooperation on extradition with other States Parties to this Convention; and</p><p><em>(b) </em>If they do not take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation</p><p>on extradition, seek, where appropriate, to conclude treaties on extradition with</p><p>other States Parties to this Convention in order to implement this article.</p><p>6. States Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence</p><p>of a treaty shall recognize offences to which this article applies as extraditable</p><p>offences between themselves.</p><p>7. Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the</p><p>domestic law of the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties,</p><p>including, inter alia, conditions in relation to the minimum penalty requirement</p><p>for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State Party may</p><p>refuse extradition.</p><p>8. States Parties shall, subject to their domestic law, endeavour to expedite</p><p>extradition procedures and to simplify evidentiary requirements relating</p><p>thereto in respect of any offence to which this article applies.</p><p>18</p><p>9. Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition</p><p>treaties, the requested State Party may, upon being satisfied that the circumstances</p><p>so warrant and are urgent and at the request of the requesting State</p><p>Party, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present in its</p><p>territory into custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his or her</p><p>presence at extradition proceedings.</p><p>10. A State Party in whose territory an alleged offender is found, if it does</p><p>not extradite such person in respect of an offence to which this article applies</p><p>solely on the ground that he or she is one of its nationals, shall, at the request</p><p>of the State Party seeking extradition, be obliged to submit the case without</p><p>undue delay to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those</p><p>authorities shall take their decision and conduct their proceedings in the same</p><p>manner as in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the domestic</p><p>law of that State Party. The States Parties concerned shall cooperate with each</p><p>other, in particular on procedural and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the</p><p>efficiency of such prosecution.</p><p>11. Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite</p><p>or otherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the</p><p>person will be returned to that State Party to serve the sentence imposed as a</p><p>result of the trial or proceedings for which the extradition or surrender of the</p><p>person was sought and that State Party and the State Party seeking the extradition</p><p>of the person agree with this option and other terms that they may deem</p><p>appropriate, such conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to</p><p>discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 10 of this article.</p><p>12. If extradition, sought for purposes of enforcing a sentence, is refused</p><p>because the person sought is a national of the requested State Party, the requested</p><p>Party shall, if its domestic law so permits and in conformity with the</p><p>requirements of such law, upon application of the requesting Party, consider the</p><p>enforcement of the sentence that has been imposed under the domestic law of</p><p>the requesting Party or the remainder thereof.</p><p>13. Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in</p><p>connection with any of the offences to which this article applies shall be guaranteed</p><p>fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all</p><p>the rights and guarantees provided by the domestic law of the State Party in the</p><p>territory of which that person is present.</p><p>14. Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation</p><p>to extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for</p><p>believing that the request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or</p><p>19</p><p>punishing a person on account of that person’s sex, race, religion, nationality,</p><p>ethnic origin or political opinions or that compliance with the request would</p><p>cause prejudice to that person’s position for any one of these reasons.</p><p>15. States Parties may not refuse a request for extradition on the sole</p><p>ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.</p><p>16. Before refusing extradition, the requested State Party shall, where</p><p>appropriate, consult with the requesting State Party to provide it with ample</p><p>opportunity to present its opinions and to provide information relevant to its</p><p>allegation.</p><p>17. States Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements</p><p>or arrangements to carry out or to enhance the effectiveness of extradition.</p><p><em>Article 17. Transfer of sentenced persons</em></p><p>States Parties may consider entering into bilateral or multilateral agreements</p><p>or arrangements on the transfer to their territory of persons sentenced to</p><p>imprisonment or other forms of deprivation of liberty for offences covered by</p><p>this Convention, in order that they may complete their sentences there.</p><p><em>Article 18. Mutual legal assistance</em></p><p>1. States Parties shall afford one another the widest measure of mutual</p><p>legal assistance in investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation</p><p>to the offences covered by this Convention as provided for in article 3 and</p><p>shall reciprocally extend to one another similar assistance where the requesting</p><p>State Party has reasonable grounds to suspect that the offence referred to in</p><p>article 3, paragraph 1 <em>(a) </em>or <em>(b), </em>is transnational in nature, including that victims,</p><p>witnesses, proceeds, instrumentalities or evidence of such offences are</p><p>located in the requested State Party and that the offence involves an organized</p><p>criminal group.</p><p>2. Mutual legal assistance shall be afforded to the fullest extent possible</p><p>under relevant laws, treaties, agreements and arrangements of the requested</p><p>State Party with respect to investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings</p><p>in relation to the offences for which a legal person may be held liable in</p><p>accordance with article 10 of this Convention in the requesting State Party.</p><p>3. Mutual legal assistance to be afforded in accordance with this article</p><p>may be requested for any of the following purposes:</p><p>20</p><p><em>(a) </em>Taking evidence or statements from persons;</p><p><em>(b) </em>Effecting service of judicial documents;</p><p><em>(c) </em>Executing searches and seizures, and freezing;</p><p><em>(d) </em>Examining objects and sites;</p><p><em>(e) </em>Providing information, evidentiary items and expert evaluations;</p><p><em>(f) </em>Providing originals or certified copies of relevant documents and</p><p>records, including government, bank, financial, corporate or business records;</p><p><em>(g) </em>Identifying or tracing proceeds of crime, property, instrumentalities or</p><p>other things for evidentiary purposes;</p><p><em>(h) </em>Facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting</p><p>State Party;</p><p><em>(i) </em>Any other type of assistance that is not contrary to the domestic law</p><p>of the requested State Party.</p><p>4. Without prejudice to domestic law, the competent authorities of a</p><p>State Party may, without prior request, transmit information relating to criminal</p><p>matters to a competent authority in another State Party where they believe</p><p>that such information could assist the authority in undertaking or successfully</p><p>concluding inquiries and criminal proceedings or could result in a request</p><p>formulated by the latter State Party pursuant to this Convention.</p><p>5. The transmission of information pursuant to paragraph 4 of this</p><p>article shall be without prejudice to inquiries and criminal proceedings in the</p><p>State of the competent authorities providing the information. The competent</p><p>authorities receiving the information shall comply with a request that said information</p><p>remain confidential, even temporarily, or with restrictions on its use.</p><p>However, this shall not prevent the receiving State Party from disclosing in its</p><p>proceedings information that is exculpatory to an accused person. In such a</p><p>case, the receiving State Party shall notify the transmitting State Party prior to</p><p>the disclosure and, if so requested, consult with the transmitting State Party. If,</p><p>in an exceptional case, advance notice is not possible, the receiving State Party</p><p>shall inform the transmitting State Party of the disclosure without delay.</p><p>6. The provisions of this article shall not affect the obligations under any</p><p>other treaty, bilateral or multilateral, that governs or will govern, in whole or</p><p>in part, mutual legal assistance.</p><p>7. Paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article shall apply to requests made pursuant</p><p>to this article if the States Parties in question are not bound by a treaty of</p><p>mutual legal assistance. If those States Parties are bound by such a treaty, the</p><p>21</p><p>corresponding provisions of that treaty shall apply unless the States Parties agree</p><p>to apply paragraphs 9 to 29 of this article in lieu thereof. States Parties are</p><p>strongly encouraged to apply these paragraphs if they facilitate cooperation.</p><p>8. States Parties shall not decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant</p><p>to this article on the ground of bank secrecy.</p><p>9. States Parties may decline to render mutual legal assistance pursuant</p><p>to this article on the ground of absence of dual criminality. However, the</p><p>requested State Party may, when it deems appropriate, provide assistance, to the</p><p>extent it decides at its discretion, irrespective of whether the conduct would</p><p>constitute an offence under the domestic law of the requested State Party.</p><p>10. A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory</p><p>of one State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for</p><p>purposes of identification, testimony or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining</p><p>evidence for investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings in relation</p><p>to offences covered by this Convention may be transferred if the following</p><p>conditions are met:</p><p><em>(a) </em>The person freely gives his or her informed consent;</p><p><em>(b) </em>The competent authorities of both States Parties agree, subject to such</p><p>conditions as those States Parties may deem appropriate.</p><p>11. For the purposes of paragraph 10 of this article:</p><p><em>(a) </em>The State Party to which the person is transferred shall have the</p><p>authority and obligation to keep the person transferred in custody, unless otherwise</p><p>requested or authorized by the State Party from which the person was</p><p>transferred;</p><p><em>(b) </em>The State Party to which the person is transferred shall without delay</p><p>implement its obligation to return the person to the custody of the State Party</p><p>from which the person was transferred as agreed beforehand, or as otherwise</p><p>agreed, by the competent authorities of both States Parties;</p><p><em>(c) </em>The State Party to which the person is transferred shall not require the</p><p>State Party from which the person was transferred to initiate extradition proceedings</p><p>for the return of the person;</p><p><em>(d) </em>The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence</p><p>being served in the State from which he or she was transferred for time spent</p><p>in the custody of the State Party to which he or she was transferred.</p><p>12. Unless the State Party from which a person is to be transferred in</p><p>accordance with paragraphs 10 and 11 of this article so agrees, that person,</p><p>22</p><p>whatever his or her nationality, shall not be prosecuted, detained, punished or</p><p>subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in the territory</p><p>of the State to which that person is transferred in respect of acts, omissions or</p><p>convictions prior to his or her departure from the territory of the State from</p><p>which he or she was transferred.</p><p>13. Each State Party shall designate a central authority that shall have the</p><p>responsibility and power to receive requests for mutual legal assistance and</p><p>either to execute them or to transmit them to the competent authorities for</p><p>execution. Where a State Party has a special region or territory with a separate</p><p>system of mutual legal assistance, it may designate a distinct central authority</p><p>that shall have the same function for that region or territory. Central authorities</p><p>shall ensure the speedy and proper execution or transmission of the requests</p><p>received. Where the central authority transmits the request to a competent</p><p>authority for execution, it shall encourage the speedy and proper execution of</p><p>the request by the competent authority. The Secretary-General of the United</p><p>Nations shall be notified of the central authority designated for this purpose at</p><p>the time each State Party deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance or</p><p>approval of or accession to this Convention. Requests for mutual legal assistance</p><p>and any communication related thereto shall be transmitted to the central</p><p>authorities designated by the States Parties. This requirement shall be without</p><p>prejudice to the right of a State Party to require that such requests and communications</p><p>be addressed to it through diplomatic channels and, in urgent</p><p>circumstances, where the States Parties agree, through the International</p><p>Criminal Police Organization, if possible.</p><p>14. Requests shall be made in writing or, where possible, by any means</p><p>capable of producing a written record, in a language acceptable to the requested</p><p>State Party, under conditions allowing that State Party to establish authenticity.</p><p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations shall be notified of the language</p><p>or languages acceptable to each State Party at the time it deposits its instrument</p><p>of ratification, acceptance or approval of or accession to this Convention. In</p><p>urgent circumstances and where agreed by the States Parties, requests may be</p><p>made orally, but shall be confirmed in writing forthwith.</p><p>15. A request for mutual legal assistance shall contain:</p><p><em>(a) </em>The identity of the authority making the request;</p><p><em>(b) </em>The subject matter and nature of the investigation, prosecution or</p><p>judicial proceeding to which the request relates and the name and functions of</p><p>the authority conducting the investigation, prosecution or judicial proceeding;</p><p><em>(c) </em>A summary of the relevant facts, except in relation to requests for the</p><p>purpose of service of judicial documents;</p><p>23</p><p><em>(d) </em>A description of the assistance sought and details of any particular</p><p>procedure that the requesting State Party wishes to be followed;</p><p><em>(e) </em>Where possible, the identity, location and nationality of any person</p><p>concerned; and</p><p><em>(f) </em>The purpose for which the evidence, information or action is sought.</p><p>16. The requested State Party may request additional information when</p><p>it appears necessary for the execution of the request in accordance with its</p><p>domestic law or when it can facilitate such execution.</p><p>17. A request shall be executed in accordance with the domestic law of</p><p>the requested State Party and, to the extent not contrary to the domestic law</p><p>of the requested State Party and where possible, in accordance with the procedures</p><p>specified in the request.</p><p>18. Wherever possible and consistent with fundamental principles of</p><p>domestic law, when an individual is in the territory of a State Party and has to</p><p>be heard as a witness or expert by the judicial authorities of another State Party,</p><p>the first State Party may, at the request of the other, permit the hearing to take</p><p>place by video conference if it is not possible or desirable for the individual in</p><p>question to appear in person in the territory of the requesting State Party. States</p><p>Parties may agree that the hearing shall be conducted by a judicial authority of</p><p>the requesting State Party and attended by a judicial authority of the requested</p><p>State Party.</p><p>19. The requesting State Party shall not transmit or use information or</p><p>evidence furnished by the requested State Party for investigations, prosecutions</p><p>or judicial proceedings other than those stated in the request without the prior</p><p>consent of the requested State Party. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the</p><p>requesting State Party from disclosing in its proceedings information or evidence</p><p>that is exculpatory to an accused person. In the latter case, the requesting</p><p>State Party shall notify the requested State Party prior to the disclosure and, if</p><p>so requested, consult with the requested State Party. If, in an exceptional case,</p><p>advance notice is not possible, the requesting State Party shall inform the</p><p>requested State Party of the disclosure without delay.</p><p>20. The requesting State Party may require that the requested State Party</p><p>keep confidential the fact and substance of the request, except to the extent</p><p>necessary to execute the request. If the requested State Party cannot comply with</p><p>the requirement of confidentiality, it shall promptly inform the requesting State</p><p>Party.</p><p>21. Mutual legal assistance may be refused:</p><p>24</p><p><em>(a) </em>If the request is not made in conformity with the provisions of this</p><p>article;</p><p><em>(b) </em>If the requested State Party considers that execution of the request is</p><p>likely to prejudice its sovereignty, security, <em>ordre public </em>or other essential</p><p>interests;</p><p><em>(c) </em>If the authorities of the requested State Party would be prohibited by</p><p>its domestic law from carrying out the action requested with regard to any</p><p>similar offence, had it been subject to investigation, prosecution or judicial</p><p>proceedings under their own jurisdiction;</p><p><em>(d) </em>If it would be contrary to the legal system of the requested State Party</p><p>relating to mutual legal assistance for the request to be granted.</p><p>22. States Parties may not refuse a request for mutual legal assistance on</p><p>the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters.</p><p>23. Reasons shall be given for any refusal of mutual legal assistance.</p><p>24. The requested State Party shall execute the request for mutual legal</p><p>assistance as soon as possible and shall take as full account as possible of any</p><p>deadlines suggested by the requesting State Party and for which reasons are</p><p>given, preferably in the request. The requested State Party shall respond to</p><p>reasonable requests by the requesting State Party on progress of its handling of</p><p>the request. The requesting State Party shall promptly inform the requested</p><p>State Party when the assistance sought is no longer required.</p><p>25.

(<em>m</em>) performing any other functions entrusted to a consular post by the sending State which are not prohibited by the laws and regulations of the receiving State or to which no objection is taken by the receiving State or which are referred to in the international agreements in force between the sending State and the receiving State. <em>Article 6</em> <em>Exercise of consular functions outside the consular district</em> A consular officer may, in special circumstances, with the consent of the receiving State, exercise his functions outside his consular district. 6 <em>Article 7</em> <em>Exercise of consular functions in a third State</em> The sending State may, after notifying the States concerned, entrust a consular post established in a particular State with the exercise of consular functions in another State, unless there is express objection by one of the States concerned. <em>Article 8</em> <em>Exercise of consular functions on behalf of a third State</em> Upon appropriate notification to the receiving State, a consular post of the sending State may, unless the receiving State objects, exercise consular functions in the receiving State on behalf of a third State. <em>Article 9</em> <em>Classes of heads of consular posts</em> 1.Heads of consular posts are divided into four classes, namely (<em>a</em>) consuls-general; (<em>b</em>) consuls; (<em>c</em>) vice-consuls; (<em>d</em>) consular agents. 2.Paragraph 1 of this article in no way restricts the right of any of the Contracting Parties to fix the designation of consular officers other than the heads of consular posts. <em>Article 10</em> <em>Appointment and admission of heads of consular posts</em> 1.Heads of consular posts are appointed by the sending State and are admitted to the exercise of their functions by the receiving State. 2.Subject to the provisions of the present Convention, the formalities for the appointment and for the admission of the head of a consular post are determined by the laws, regulations and usages of the sending State and of the receiving State respectively. <em>Article 11</em> <em>The consular commission or notification of appointment</em> 1.The head of a consular post shall be provided by the sending State with a document, in the form of a commission or similar instrument, made out for each appointment, certifying his capacity and 7 showing, as a general rule, his full name, his category and class, the consular district and the seat of the consular post. 2.The sending State shall transmit the commission or similar instrument through the diplomatic or other appropriate channel to the Government of the State in whose territory the head of a consular post is to exercise his functions. 3. If the receiving State agrees, the sending State may, instead of a commission or similar instrument, send to the receiving State a notification containing the particulars required by paragraph 1 of this article. <em>Article 12</em> <em>The exequatur</em> 1.The head of a consular post is admitted to the exercise of his functions by an authorization from the receiving State termed an <em>exequatur</em>, whatever the form of this authorization. 2.A State which refused to grant an <em>exequatur </em>is not obliged to give to the sending State reasons for such refusal. 3.Subject to the provisions of articles 13 and 15, the head of a consular post shall not enter upon his duties until he has received an <em>exequatur</em>. <em>Article 13</em> <em>Provisional admission of heads of consular posts</em> Pending delivery of the <em>exequatur</em>, the head of a consular post may be admitted on a provisional basis to the exercise of his functions. In that case, the provisions of the present Convention shall apply. <em>Article 14</em> <em>Notification to the authorities of the consular district</em> As soon as the head of a consular post is admitted even provisionally to the exercise of his functions, the receiving State shall immediately notify the competent authorities of the consular district. It shall also ensure that the necessary measures are taken to enable the head of a consular post to carry out the duties of his office and to have the benefit of the provisions of the present Convention. <em>Article 15</em> <em>Temporary exercise of the functions of the</em> <em>head of a consular post</em> 1. If the head of a consular post is unable to carry out his functions or the position of head of consular post is vacant, an acting head of post may act provisionally as head of the consular post. 2.The full name of the acting head of post shall be notified either by the diplomatic mission of the sending State or, if that State has no such mission in the receiving State, by the head of the consular 8 post, or, if he is unable to do so, by any competent authority of the sending State, to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the receiving State or to the authority designated by that Ministry. As a general rule, this notification shall be given in advance. The receiving State may make the admission as acting head of post of a person who is neither a diplomatic agent nor a consular officer of the sending State in the receiving State conditional on its consent. 3.The competent authorities of the receiving State shall afford assistance and protection to the acting head of post. While he is in charge of the post, the provisions of the present Convention shall apply to him on the same basis as to the head of the consular post concerned. The receiving State shall not, however, be obliged to grant to an acting head of post any facility, privilege or immunity which the head of the consular post enjoys only subject to conditions not fulfilled by the acting head of post. 4.When, in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 of this article, a member of the diplomatic staff of the diplomatic mission of the sending State in the receiving State is designated by the sending State as an acting head of post, he shall, if the receiving State does not object thereto, continue to enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities. <em>Article 16</em> <em>Precedence as between heads of consular posts</em> 1.Heads of consular posts shall rank in each class according to the date of the grant of the <em>exequatur</em>. 2.

CONCLUSION OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 6</p><p>Capacity of States to conclude treaties</p><p>Every State possesses capacity to conclude treaties.</p><p>Article 7</p><p>Full powers</p><p>1. A person is considered as representing a State for the purpose of adopting or authenticating the text of a treaty or for the purpose of expressing the consent of the State to be bound by a treaty if:</p><p>(a) he produces appropriate full powers; or</p><p>(b) it appears from the practice of the States concerned or from other circumstances that their intention was to consider that person as representing the State for such purposes and to dispense with full powers.</p><p>4</p><p>2. In virtue of their functions and without having to produce full powers, the following are considered as representing their State:</p><p>(a) Heads of State, Heads of Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs, for the purpose of performing all acts relating to the conclusion of a treaty;</p><p>(b) heads of diplomatic missions, for the purpose of adopting the text of a treaty between the accrediting State and the State to which they are accredited;</p><p>(c) representatives accredited by States to an international conference or to an international organization or one of its organs, for the purpose of adopting the text of a treaty in that conference, organization or organ.</p><p>Article 8</p><p>Subsequent confirmation of an act performed without authorization</p><p>An act relating to the conclusion of a treaty performed by a person who cannot be considered under article 7 as authorized to represent a State for that purpose is without legal effect unless afterwards confirmed by that State.</p><p>Article 9</p><p>Adoption of the text</p><p>1. The adoption of the text of a treaty takes place by the consent of all the States participating in its drawing up except as provided in paragraph 2.</p><p>2. The adoption of the text of a treaty at an international conference takes place by the vote of two thirds of the States present and voting, unless by the same majority they shall decide to apply a different rule.</p><p>Article 10</p><p>Authentication of the text</p><p>The text of a treaty is established as authentic and definitive:</p><p>(a) by such procedure as may be provided for in the text or agreed upon by the States participating in its drawing up; or</p><p>(b) failing such procedure, by the signature, signature ad referendum or initialling by the representatives of those States of the text of the treaty or of the Final Act of a conference incorporating the text.</p><p>5</p><p>Article 11</p><p>Means of expressing consent to be bound by a treaty</p><p>The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be expressed by signature, exchange of instruments constituting a treaty, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or by any other means if so agreed.</p><p>Article 12</p><p>Consent to be bound by a treaty expressed by signature</p><p>1. The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by the signature of its representative when:</p><p>(a) the treaty provides that signature shall have that effect;</p><p>(b) it is otherwise established that the negotiating States were agreed that signature should have that effect; or</p><p>(c) the intention of the State to give that effect to the signature appears from the full powers of its representative or was expressed during the negotiation.</p><p>2. For the purposes of paragraph 1:</p><p>(a) the initialling of a text constitutes a signature of the treaty when it is established that the negotiating States so agreed;</p><p>(b) the signature ad referendum of a treaty by a representative, if confirmed by his State, constitutes a full signature of the treaty.</p><p>Article 13</p><p>Consent to be bound by a treaty expressed by an exchange of instruments constituting a treaty</p><p>The consent of States to be bound by a treaty constituted by instruments exchanged between them is expressed by that exchange when:</p><p>(a) the instruments provide that their exchange shall have that effect; or</p><p>(b) it is otherwise established that those States were agreed that the exchange of instruments should have that effect.</p><p>Article 14</p><p>Consent to be bound by a treaty expressed by ratification, acceptance or approval</p><p>1. The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by ratification when:</p><p>6</p><p>(a) the treaty provides for such consent to be expressed by means of ratification;</p><p>(b) it is otherwise established that the negotiating States were agreed that ratification should be required;</p><p>(c) the representative of the State has signed the treaty subject to ratification; or</p><p>(d) the intention of the State to sign the treaty subject to ratification appears from the full powers of its representative or was expressed during the negotiation.</p><p>2. The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by acceptance or approval under conditions similar to those which apply to ratification.</p><p>Article 15</p><p>Consent to be bound by a treaty expressed by accession</p><p>The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is expressed by accession when:</p><p>(a) the treaty provides that such consent may be expressed by that State by means of accession;</p><p>(b) it is otherwise established that the negotiating States were agreed that such consent may be expressed by that State by means of accession; or</p><p>(c) all the parties have subsequently agreed that such consent may be expressed by that State by means of accession.</p><p>Article 16</p><p>Exchange or deposit of instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession</p><p>Unless the treaty otherwise provides, instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession establish the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty upon:</p><p>(a) their exchange between the contracting States;</p><p>(b) their deposit with the depositary; or</p><p>(c) their notification to the contracting States or to the depositary, if so agreed.</p><p>Article 17</p><p>Consent to be bound by part of a treaty and choice of differing provisions</p><p>1. Without prejudice to articles 19 to 23, the consent of a State to be bound by part of a treaty is effective only if the treaty so permits or the other contracting States so agree.</p><p>7</p><p>2. The consent of a State to be bound by a treaty which permits a choice between differing provisions is effective only if it is made clear to which of the provisions the consent relates.</p><p>Article 18</p><p>Obligation not to defeat the object and purpose of a treaty prior to its entry into force</p><p>A State is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of a treaty when:</p><p>(a) it has signed the treaty or has exchanged instruments constituting the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, until it shall have made its intention clear not to become a party to the treaty; or</p><p>(b) it has expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, pending the entry into force of the treaty and provided that such entry into force is not unduly delayed.</p><p>SECTION 2. RESERVATIONS</p><p>Article 19</p><p>Formulation of reservations</p><p>A State may, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, formulate a reservation unless:</p><p>(a) the reservation is prohibited by the treaty;</p><p>(b) the treaty provides that only specified reservations, which do not include the reservation in question, may be made; or</p><p>(c) in cases not failing under subparagraphs (a) and (b), the reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.</p><p>Article 20</p><p>Acceptance of and objection to reservations</p><p>1. A reservation expressly authorized by a treaty does not require any subsequent acceptance by the other contracting States unless the treaty so provides.</p><p>2. When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating States and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.</p><p>3. When a treaty is a constituent instrument of an international organization and unless it otherwise provides, a reservation requires the acceptance of the competent organ of that organization.</p><p>4. In cases not falling under the preceding paragraphs and unless the treaty otherwise provides:</p><p>8</p><p>(a) acceptance by another contracting State of a reservation constitutes the reserving State a party to the treaty in relation to that other State if or when the treaty is in force for those States;</p><p>(b) an objection by another contracting State to a reservation does not preclude the entry into force of the treaty as between the objecting and reserving States unless a contrary intention is definitely expressed by the objecting State;</p><p>(c) an act expressing a State’s consent to be bound by the treaty and containing a reservation is effective as soon as at least one other contracting State has accepted the reservation.</p><p>5. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 4 and unless the treaty otherwise provides, a reservation is considered to have been accepted by a State if it shall have raised no objection to the reservation by the end of a period of twelve months after it was notified of the reservation or by the date on which it expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, whichever is later.</p><p>Article 21</p><p>Legal effects of reservations and of objections to reservations</p><p>1. A reservation established with regard to another party in accordance with articles 19, 20 and 23:</p><p>(a) modifies for the reserving State in its relations with that other party the provisions of the treaty to which the reservation relates to the extent of the reservation; and</p><p>(b) modifies those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations with the reserving State.</p><p>2. The reservation does not modify the provisions of the treaty for the other parties to the treaty inter se.</p><p>3. When a State objecting to a reservation has not opposed the entry into force of the treaty between itself and the reserving State, the provisions to which the reservation relates do not apply as between the two States to the extent of the reservation.</p><p>Article 22</p><p>Withdrawal of reservations and of objections to reservations</p><p>1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, a reservation may be withdrawn at any time and the consent of a State which has accepted the reservation is not required for its withdrawal.</p><p>2. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, an objection to a reservation may be withdrawn at any time.</p><p>3. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, or it is otherwise agreed:</p><p>9</p><p>(a) the withdrawal of a reservation becomes operative in relation to another contracting State only when notice of it has been received by that State;</p><p>(b) the withdrawal of an objection to a reservation becomes operative only when notice of it has been received by the State which formulated the reservation.</p><p>Article 23</p><p>Procedure regarding reservations</p><p>1. A reservation, an express acceptance of a reservation and an objection to a reservation must be formulated in writing and communicated to the contracting States and other States entitled to become parties to the treaty.</p><p>2. If formulated when signing the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, a reservation must be formally confirmed by the reserving State when expressing its consent to be bound by the treaty. In such a case the reservation shall be considered as having been made on the date of its confirmation.</p><p>3. An express acceptance of, or an objection to, a reservation made previously to confirmation of the reservation does not itself require confirmation.</p><p>4. The withdrawal of a reservation or of an objection to a reservation must be formulated in writing.</p><p>SECTION 3. ENTRY INTO FORCE AND PROVISIONAL, APPLICATION OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 24</p><p>Entry into force</p><p>1. A treaty enters into force in such manner and upon such date as it may provide or as the negotiating States may agree.</p><p>2. Failing any such provision or agreement, a treaty enters into force as soon as consent to be bound by the treaty has been established for all the negotiating States.</p><p>3. When the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty is established on a date after the treaty has come into force, the treaty enters into force for that State on that date, unless the treaty otherwise provides.</p><p>4. The provisions of a treaty regulating the authentication of its text, the establishment of the consent of States to be bound by the treaty, the manner or date of its entry into force, reservations, the functions of the depositary and other matters arising necessarily before the entry into force of the treaty apply from the time of the adoption of its text.</p><p>10</p><p>Article 25</p><p>Provisional application</p><p>1. A treaty or a part of a treaty is applied provisionally pending its entry into force if:</p><p>(a) the treaty itself so provides; or</p><p>(b) the negotiating States have in some other manner so agreed.</p><p>2. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the negotiating States have otherwise agreed, the provisional application of a treaty or a part of a treaty with respect to a State shall be terminated if that State notifies the other States between which the treaty is being applied provisionally of its intention not to become a party to the treaty.</p><p>PART III.</p><p>OBSERVANCE, APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES</p><p>SECTION 1. OBSERVANCE OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 26</p><p>“Pacta sunt servanda”</p><p>Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.</p><p>Article 27</p><p>Internal law and observance of treaties</p><p>A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. This rule is without prejudice to article 46.</p><p>SECTION 2. APPLICATION OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 28</p><p>Non-retroactivity of treaties</p><p>Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.</p><p>Article 29</p><p>Territorial scope of treaties</p><p>Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.</p><p>11</p><p>Article 30</p><p>Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter</p><p>1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.</p><p>2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.</p><p>3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.</p><p>4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one:</p><p>(a) as between States Parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3;</p><p>(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights and obligations.</p><p>5. Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question of the termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty under article 60 or to any question of responsibility which may arise for a State from the conclusion or application of a treaty the provisions of which are incompatible with its obligations towards another State under another treaty.</p><p>SECTION 3. INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 31</p><p>General rule of interpretation</p><p>1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.</p><p>2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:</p><p>(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;</p><p>(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.</p><p>3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:</p><p>12</p><p>(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;</p><p>(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;</p><p>(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.</p><p>4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.</p><p>Article 32</p><p>Supplementary means of interpretation</p><p>Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:</p><p>(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or</p><p>(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.</p><p>Article 33</p><p>Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages</p><p>1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.</p><p>2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.</p><p>3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.</p><p>4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.</p><p>SECTION 4. TREATIES AND THIRD STATES</p><p>Article 34</p><p>General rule regarding third States</p><p>A treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.</p><p>13</p><p>Article 35</p><p>Treaties providing for obligations for third States</p><p>An obligation arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to the treaty intend the provision to be the means of establishing the obligation and the third State expressly accepts that obligation in writing.</p><p>Article 36</p><p>Treaties providing for rights for third States</p><p>1. A right arises for a third State from a provision of a treaty if the parties to the treaty intend the provision to accord that right either to the third State, or to a group of States to which it belongs, or to all States, and the third State assents thereto. Its assent shall be presumed so long as the contrary is not indicated, unless the treaty otherwise provides.</p><p>2. A State exercising a right in accordance with paragraph 1 shall comply with the conditions for its exercise provided for in the treaty or established in conformity with the treaty.</p><p>Article 37</p><p>Revocation or modification of obligations or rights of third States</p><p>1. When an obligation has arisen for a third State in conformity with article 35, the obligation may be revoked or modified only with the consent of the parties to the treaty and of the third State, unless it is established that they had otherwise agreed.</p><p>2. When a right has arisen for a third State in conformity with article 36, the right may not be revoked or modified by the parties if it is established that the right was intended not to be revocable or subject to modification without the consent of the third State.</p><p>Article 38</p><p>Rules in a treaty becoming binding on third States through international custom</p><p>Nothing in articles 34 to 37 precludes a rule set forth in a treaty from becoming binding upon a third State as a customary rule of international law, recognized as such.</p><p>PART IV.</p><p>AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 39</p><p>General rule regarding the amendment of treaties</p><p>A treaty may be amended by agreement between the parties. The rules laid down in Part II apply to such an agreement except insofar as the treaty may otherwise provide.</p><p>14</p><p>Article 40</p><p>Amendment of multilateral treaties</p><p>1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides, the amendment of multilateral treaties shall be governed by the following paragraphs.</p><p>2. Any proposal to amend a multilateral treaty as between all the parties must be notified to all the contracting States, each one of which shall have the right to take part in:</p><p>(a) the decision as to the action to be taken in regard to such proposal;</p><p>(b) the negotiation and conclusion of any agreement for the amendment of the treaty.</p><p>3. Every State entitled to become a party to the treaty shall also be entitled to become a party to the treaty as amended.</p><p>4. The amending agreement does not bind any State already a party to the treaty which does not become a party to the amending agreement; article 30, paragraph 4 (b), applies in relation to such State.</p><p>5. Any State which becomes a party to the treaty after the entry into force of the amending agreement shall, failing an expression of a different intention by that State:</p><p>(a) be considered as a party to the treaty as amended; and</p><p>(b) be considered as a party to the unamended treaty in relation to any party to the treaty not bound by the amending agreement.</p><p>Article 41</p><p>Agreements to modify multilateral treaties between certain of the parties only</p><p>1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:</p><p>(a) the possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty; or</p><p>(b) the modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:</p><p>(i) does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;</p><p>(ii) does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole.</p><p>2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph 1 (a) the treaty otherwise provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the treaty for which it provides.</p><p>15</p><p>PART V.</p><p>INVALIDITY, TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF TREATIES</p><p>SECTION 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><p>Article 42</p><p>Validity and continuance in force of treaties</p><p>1. The validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the present Convention.</p><p>2. The termination of a treaty, its denunciation or the withdrawal of a party, may take place only as a result of the application of the provisions of the treaty or of the present Convention. The same rule applies to suspension of the operation of a treaty.</p><p>Article 43</p><p>Obligations imposed by international law independently of a treaty</p><p>The invalidity, termination or denunciation of a treaty, the withdrawal of a party from it, or the suspension of its operation, as a result of the application of the present Convention or of the provisions of the treaty, shall not in any way impair the duty of any State to fulfil any obligation embodied in the treaty to which it would be subject under international law independently of the treaty.</p><p>Article 44</p><p>Separability of treaty provisions</p><p>1. A right of a party, provided for in a treaty or arising under article 56, to denounce, withdraw from or suspend the operation of the treaty may be exercised only with respect to the whole treaty unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree.</p><p>2. A ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty recognized in the present Convention may be invoked only with respect to the whole treaty except as provided in the following paragraphs or in article 60.</p><p>3. If the ground relates solely to particular clauses, it may be invoked only with respect to those clauses where:</p><p>(a) the said clauses are separable from the remainder of the treaty with regard to their application;</p><p>(b) it appears from the treaty or is otherwise established that acceptance of those clauses was not an essential basis of the consent of the other party or parties to be bound by the treaty as a whole; and</p><p>(c) continued performance of the remainder of the treaty would not be unjust.</p><p>4. In cases falling under articles 49 and 50, the State entitled to invoke the fraud or corruption may do so with respect either to the whole treaty or, subject to paragraph 3, to the particular clauses alone.</p><p>16</p><p>5. In cases falling under articles 51, 52 and 53, no separation of the provisions of the treaty is permitted.</p><p>Article 45</p><p>Loss of a right to invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty</p><p>A State may no longer invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty under articles 46 to 50 or articles 60 and 62 if, after becoming aware of the facts:</p><p>(a) it shall have expressly agreed that the treaty is valid or remains in force or continues in operation, as the case may be; or</p><p>(b) it must by reason of its conduct be considered as having acquiesced in the validity of the treaty or in its maintenance in force or in operation, as the case may be.</p><p>SECTION 2. INVALIDITY OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 46</p><p>Provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties</p><p>1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.</p><p>2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.</p><p>Article 47</p><p>Specific restrictions on authority to express the consent of a State</p><p>If the authority of a representative to express the consent of a State to be bound by a particular treaty has been made subject to a specific restriction, his omission to observe that restriction may not be invoked as invalidating the consent expressed by him unless the restriction was notified to the other negotiating States prior to his expressing such consent.</p><p>Article 48</p><p>Error</p><p>1. A State may invoke an error in a treaty as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty if the error relates to a fact or situation which was assumed by that State to exist at the time when the treaty was concluded and formed an essential basis of its consent to be bound by the treaty.</p><p>17</p><p>2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the State in question contributed by its own conduct to the error or if the circumstances were such as to put that State on notice of a possible error.</p><p>3. An error relating only to the wording of the text of a treaty does not affect its validity; article 79 then applies.</p><p>Article 49</p><p>Fraud</p><p>If a State has been induced to conclude a treaty by the fraudulent conduct of another negotiating State, the State may invoke the fraud as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty.</p><p>Article 50</p><p>Corruption of a representative of a State</p><p>If the expression of a State’s consent to be bound by a treaty has been procured through the corruption of its representative directly or indirectly by another negotiating State, the State may invoke such corruption as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty.</p><p>Article 51</p><p>Coercion of a representative of a State</p><p>The expression of a State’s consent to be bound by a treaty which has been procured by the coercion of its representative through acts or threats directed against him shall be without any legal effect.</p><p>Article 52</p><p>Coercion of a State by the threat or use of force</p><p>A treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.</p><p>Article 53</p><p>Treaties conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law (“jus cogens”)</p><p>A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.</p><p>18</p><p>SECTION 3. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF TREATIES</p><p>Article 54</p><p>Termination of or withdrawal from a treaty under its provisions or by consent of the parties</p><p>The termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of a party may take place:</p><p>(a) in conformity with the provisions of the treaty; or</p><p>(b) at any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting States.</p><p>Article 55</p><p>Reduction of the parties to a multilateral treaty below the number necessary for its entry into force</p><p>Unless the treaty otherwise provides, a multilateral treaty does not terminate by reason only of the fact that the number of the parties falls below the number necessary for its entry into force.</p><p>Article 56</p><p>Denunciation of or withdrawal from a treaty containing no provision regarding termination, denunciation or withdrawal</p><p>1. A treaty which contains no provision regarding its termination and which does not provide for denunciation or withdrawal is not subject to denunciation or withdrawal unless:</p><p>(a) it is established that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal; or</p><p>(b) a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied by the nature of the treaty.</p><p>2. A party shall give not less than twelve months’ notice of its intention to denounce or withdraw from a treaty under paragraph 1.</p><p>Article 57</p><p>Suspension of the operation of a treaty under its provisions or by consent of the parties</p><p>The operation of a treaty in regard to all the parties or to a particular party may be suspended:</p><p>(a) in conformity with the provisions of the treaty; or</p><p>(b) at any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting States.</p><p>19</p><p>Article 58</p><p>Suspension of the operation of a multilateral treaty by agreement between certain of the parties only</p><p>1. Two or more parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to suspend the operation of provisions of the treaty, temporarily and as between themselves alone, if:</p><p>(a) the possibility of such a suspension is provided for by the treaty; or</p><p>(b) the suspension in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:</p><p>(i) does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;</p><p>(ii) is not incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.</p><p>2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph 1 (a) the treaty otherwise provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the agreement and of those provisions of the treaty the operation of which they intend to suspend.</p><p>Article 59</p><p>Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty</p><p>1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:</p><p>(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or</p><p>(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.</p><p>2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intention of the parties.</p><p>Article 60</p><p>Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty as a consequence of its breach</p><p>1. A material breach of a bilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the other to invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part.</p><p>2. A material breach of a multilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles:</p><p>(a) the other parties by unanimous agreement to suspend the operation of the treaty in whole or in part or to terminate it either:</p><p>20</p><p>(i) in the relations between themselves and the defaulting State; or</p><p>(ii) as between all the parties;</p><p>(b) a party specially affected by the breach to invoke it as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty in whole or in part in the relations between itself and the defaulting State;</p><p>(c) any party other than the defaulting State to invoke the breach as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty in whole or in part with respect to itself if the treaty is of such a character that a material breach of its provisions by one party radically changes the position of every party with respect to the further performance of its obligations under the treaty.</p><p>3. A material breach of a treaty, for the purposes of this article, consists in:</p><p>(a) a repudiation of the treaty not sanctioned by the present Convention; or</p><p>(b) the violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of the treaty.</p><p>4. The foregoing paragraphs are without prejudice to any provision in the treaty applicable in the event of a breach.</p><p>5. Paragraphs 1 to 3 do not apply to provisions relating to the protection of the human person contained in treaties of a humanitarian character, in particular to provisions prohibiting any form of reprisals against persons protected by such treaties.</p><p>Article 61</p><p>Supervening impossibility of performance</p><p>1. A party may invoke the impossibility of performing a treaty as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from it if the impossibility results from the permanent disappearance or destruction of an object indispensable for the execution of the treaty. If the impossibility is temporary, it may be invoked only as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty.</p><p>2. Impossibility of performance may not be invoked by a party as a ground for terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty if the impossibility is the result of a breach by that party either of an obligation under the treaty or of any other international obligation owed to any other party to the treaty.</p><p>Article 62</p><p>Fundamental change of circumstances</p><p>1. A fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties, may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from the treaty unless:</p><p>(a) the existence of those circumstances constituted an essential basis of the consent of the parties to be bound by the treaty; and</p><p>21</p><p>(b) the effect of the change is radically to transform the extent of obligations still to be performed under the treaty.</p><p>2. A fundamental change of circumstances may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from a treaty:</p><p>(a) if the treaty establishes a boundary; or</p><p>(b) if the fundamental change is the result of a breach by the party invoking it either of an obligation under the treaty or of any other international obligation owed to any other party to the treaty.</p><p>3. If, under the foregoing paragraphs, a party may invoke a fundamental change of circumstances as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from a treaty it may also invoke the change as a ground for suspending the operation of the treaty.</p><p>Article 63</p><p>Severance of diplomatic or consular relations</p><p>The severance of diplomatic or consular relations between parties to a treaty does not affect the legal relations established between them by the treaty except insofar as the existence of diplomatic or consular relations is indispensable for the application of the treaty.</p><p>Article 64</p><p>Emergence of a new peremptory norm of general international law (“jus cogens”)</p><p>If a new peremptory norm of general international law emerges, any existing treaty which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates.</p><p>SECTION 4. PROCEDURE</p><p>Article 65</p><p>Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a treaty</p><p>1. A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention, invokes either a defect in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a ground for impeaching the validity of a treaty, terminating it, withdrawing from it or suspending its operation, must notify the other parties of its claim. The notification shall indicate the measure proposed to be taken with respect to the treaty and the reasons therefor.</p><p>2. If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special urgency, shall not be less than three months after the receipt of the notification, no party has raised any objection, the party making the notification may carry out in the manner provided in article 67 the measure which it has proposed.</p><p>22</p><p>3. If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the parties shall seek a solution through the means indicated in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.</p><p>4. Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall affect the rights or obligations of the parties under any provisions in force binding the parties with regard to the settlement of disputes.</p><p>5. Without prejudice to article 45, the fact that a State has not previously made the notification prescribed in paragraph 1 shall not prevent it from making such notification in answer to another party claiming performance of the treaty or alleging its violation.</p><p>Article 66</p><p>Procedures for judicial settlement, arbitration and conciliation</p><p>If, under paragraph 3 of article 65, no solution has been reached within a period of 12 months following the date on which the objection was raised, the following procedures shall be followed:</p><p>(a) any one of the parties to a dispute concerning the application or the interpretation of article 53 or 64 may, by a written application, submit it to the International Court of Justice for a decision unless the parties by common consent agree to submit the dispute to arbitration;</p><p>(b) any one of the parties to a dispute concerning the application or the interpretation of any of the other articles in part V of the present Convention may set in motion the procedure specified in the Annex to the Convention by submitting a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p><p>Article 67</p><p>Instruments for declaring invalid, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty</p><p>1. The notification provided for under article 65, paragraph 1, must be made in writing.</p><p>2. Any act of declaring invalid, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty pursuant to the provisions of the treaty or of paragraphs 2 or 3 of article 65 shall be carried out through an instrument communicated to the other parties. If the instrument is not signed by the Head of State, Head of Government or Minister for Foreign Affairs, the representative of the State communicating it may be called upon to produce full powers.</p><p>Article 68</p><p>Revocation of notifications and instruments provided for in articles 65 and 67</p><p>A notification or instrument provided for in article 65 or 67 may be revoked at any time before it takes effect.</p><p>23</p><p>SECTION 5. CONSEQUENCES OF THE INVALIDITY, TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE OPERATION OF A TREATY</p><p>Article 69</p><p>Consequences of the invalidity of a treaty</p><p>1. A treaty the invalidity of which is established under the present Convention is void. The provisions of a void treaty have no legal force.</p><p>2. If acts have nevertheless been performed in reliance on such a treaty:</p><p>(a) each party may require any other party to establish as far as possible in their mutual relations the position that would have existed if the acts had not been performed;</p><p>(b) acts performed in good faith before the invalidity was invoked are not rendered unlawful by reason only of the invalidity of the treaty.</p><p>3. In cases falling under article 49, 50, 51 or 52, paragraph 2 does not apply with respect to the party to which the fraud, the act of corruption or the coercion is imputable.</p><p>4. In the case of the invalidity of a particular State’s consent to be bound by a multilateral treaty, the foregoing rules apply in the relations between that State and the parties to the treaty.</p><p>Article 70</p><p>Consequences of the termination of a treaty</p><p>1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree, the termination of a treaty under its provisions or in accordance with the present Convention:</p><p>(a) releases the parties from any obligation further to perform the treaty;</p><p>(b) does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.</p><p>2. If a State denounces or withdraws from a multilateral treaty, paragraph 1 applies in the relations between that State and each of the other parties to the treaty from the date when such denunciation or withdrawal takes effect.</p><p>Article 71</p><p>Consequences of the invalidity of a treaty which conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law</p><p>1. In the case of a treaty which is void under article 53 the parties shall:</p><p>(a) eliminate as far as possible the consequences of any act performed in reliance on any provision which conflicts with the peremptory norm of general international law; and</p><p>24</p><p>(b) bring their mutual relations into conformity with the peremptory norm of general international law.</p><p>2. In the case of a treaty which becomes void and terminates under article 64, the termination of the treaty:</p><p>(a) releases the parties from any obligation further to perform the treaty;</p><p>(b) does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination, provided that those rights, obligations or situations may thereafter be maintained only to the extent that their maintenance is not in itself in conflict with the new peremptory norm of general international la</p></div></div>
